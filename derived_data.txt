we got this gps for my husband who is an ( otr ) over the road trucker
very impressed with the shipping time , it arrived a few days earlier than expected
within a week of use however it started freezing up
could of just been a glitch in that unit
worked great when it worked ! will work great for the normal person as well but does have the "trucker" option
( the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect
) love the bigger screen , the ease of use , the ease of putting addresses into memory
nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that is just my luck
i contacted the seller and within minutes of my email i received a email back with instructions for an exchange ! very impressed all the way around !
i am a professional otr truck driver , and i bought a tnd <NUM> at a truck stop hoping to make my life easier
rand mcnally , are you listening ? first thing i did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it
the software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so i could be sent a patch on an sd card
hello ? i don not think i am all that unusual ; my home address is a po box that a friend checks weekly and that i might get to check every six months or so
i live in my truck and at truck stops
if you need to make a patch available on an sd card then you should send the sd cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold
i ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the tnd <NUM> was completely updated
i programmed in the height ( 13'6" ) , the length ( 53' ) and the weight ( 80 , 000# ) of my rig and told it that i preferred highways
i was parked at a truck stop in the cincinnati oh area
my next pickup was about <NUM> miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks
my cell phone gps ( sprint ) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup
the tnd <NUM> routed me thru <NUM> miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup
very exciting , especially since every time i refused to turn down a street posted "no trucks" the tnd <NUM> took almost <NUM> minutes to figure a , and it happened multiple times on that short trip
i decided to give it another chance
after my pickup on the north side of cincinnati just off of i needed to head to phoenix az via
easy route is to just hop on and drive west and south to the intersection of
indeed , that is what my cell phone advised
the tnd 700 , however , wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up on the other side of the city
i turned it off and the next time i passed a truck stop of the same chain i purchased it at i returned it and got my money back
i then spent $30 on a cheap printer
now i take a minute to set up my route on google and print it out
hasn not gotten me lost yet over several cross country trips .
well , what can i say
i have had this unit in my truck for about four days now
prior to that i had a garmin 755t gps
one of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature
what i would do is using a map i would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route , otherwise , like most gps is , it determines what it thinks is the best route
i could add up to <NUM> via is or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take
multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the garmin
however it was not truck specific
and considering i am now hauling strictly hazmat i wanted something that would take that into consideration
after perusing various forums , review sites , and my choices boiled down to the garmin 465t or the rand mcnally intelliroute tnd 700
even though it was quite a bit more than the garmin i chose the tnd <NUM> for several reasons
the main one being the extra screen size , and its ability to coordinate with the rand mcnally truck atlas and also its ease of updating
now on to my first impression of the tnd 700
it seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit
the first thing i noticed was it is very slow to boot compared to my old garmin
whether this is unique to the tnd <NUM> or is common amongst all truck specific gps units i cannot tell , but it is really not that big of a deal
the second thing i noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth
that might explain why the manual ( available via the tnd dock ) is well over <NUM> pages long
there is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit
the next thing i noticed was the complexity of entering routes
as previously mentioned i like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias
that was a big no go with this unit
while you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as as my old garmin
furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen , as i could with the garmin
totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have i went online and verified through an expert source connected with rand mcnally that no , that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point
also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging
for a unit of this price , and feature laden , i find this totally unacceptable
i am still mulling over selling this unit and buying the garmin 465t
i really do like this gps , the screen is magnificent , and the volume is awesome
another thing i have noticed , which i do not think is unique to this unit , is some of the weird routing that it does
i have never owned a truck specific gps before but after playing with this one for a couple of days i get the impression that what rand macnally ( and the others that use navteq ) has done is take a plain old car specific navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map
in most databases there is not a <PERCENT> thorough listing of every road in the country
what i mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don not belong on
today while coming home it tried routing me on several <NUM> ton county roads
what that means is that a truck is limited to <NUM> unless the road is posted at <NUM> tons
county roads do not have that restriction listed in the rand mcnally road atlas , so i believe that is why it is not listed
also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific
however i'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of navteq
another bone i have to pick is the poi is
not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated
i think the garmin , at least the ones that i have used , are more current
it would also be nice if i could add my own poi isto sum it up i will keep this unit a little longer to see if i can make it workable
if not i will go back to garmin
i like the concept and i like the unit but at this point i will have to say i am somewhat unimpressed
pros : large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons : inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated poi information
specific routings
cost .
not going to write a long review , even thought this unit deserves one
i have driven well over miles and done most of my own routing so i pretty know whats the fastest and shortest
have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with any gps unit they will all get you in trouble if you let them
i was really excited about this unit , due to the size and the features
allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull
but the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking
i gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did , but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due
its like the prossesor that they installed in the tnd <NUM> was <NUM> years old
example if i needed to make a simple route change i
in town down to the next street due to the fact that i couldn not make the turn or the street was blocked off , it would take the tnd <NUM> upwards of <NUM> seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me
here i am sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn not make me happy
this is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute , weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change
also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up
at least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when i made a wrong turn it got it self lost
take left on xyz street , and it was some ones drive way
or turn left in <NUM> yards and the turn was less than <NUM> feet away
you might think in a conjested city situation i might get a little mixed up , but this is out in the country
twice it put me under 12'6" bridges when i am 13'6"
of course i made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be
i also updated the os version , via rand mcnally
all in all i expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot
it just had to many route mistakes
going back to the basic garmin
this isn not just my complaints , i have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints
all of us returned the units .
i have had mine for a year and here is what we got
it tries to route be down non truck routes while telling me the truck route is illegal for me
this is such a bad problem that even interstate <NUM> in denver colorado is listed ( according to this gps ) as a non- truck route and will route you through the city instead
there are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half ( of about 50 ) have crashed to an state
our company representative said that rand mcnally informed them that the gps was not designed to say on for a long period of time
really ? it is a truck driver gps
we have one driver with a $2400 dollar ticket due to this gps routing him down the wrong road
the companies response was to update the unit
i have had mine for a year , i never noticed one update that corrected functionality , they only seem to keep messing the tools
i want a gps that routes , if i wanted tools i'd buy software for my computer
my suggestion is to by a nice garmen
my one rated for cars actually routes me better than this one rated for trucks
i am using this with a nook hd+
it works as described
the hd picture on my samsung 52&<HASHTAG> ; tv is excellent .
the cable is very wobbly and sometimes disconnects itself
the price is completely unfair and only works with the nook hd and hd+
this adaptor is real easy to setup and use right out of the box
i had not problem with it at all , it is well worth the purchase
i recommend this adaptor very much for viewing your nook videos on your hdtv
i just disagree with other reviews on the length of the adaptor , i found it to be fairly adequate as to how and where it is connected to my tv
for me it was just right not too long or too short , i was able to place my nook right below the connection on the tv stand , it did not fall or anything else , it is fine
use your own judgement , i am too busy watching my movies : )
this adapter easily connects my nook hd 7&<HASHTAG> ; to my hdtv through the hdmi cable
this is good for traveling because it makes any hotel tv a potential smart tv so long as there is an accessible hdmi port
it is also good for sharing photos from fb on a bigger screen
a bit pricey , but a good accessory to have
be sure to note that this is only for the nook hd and hd+ series
it will not work with a standard nook .
this product really works great but i found the following items you need to keep in mind : - you must have your power adapter connected for it to work
it plugs in the the bottom
it appears it needs power from the nook power adapter to operate
- the plug fits in loosely and you cannot move the nook around much without holding the adapter in place
- on initial plugin it seems you need to rock it around to get the connection but then it seems solid
- it works with a 25ft high quality hdmi cable so you can put the nook across the room with you
not tested with cheap cables
i found that my lg smarttv 3d from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things
bad software
this adapter works fine with other hdmi devices i have used like monitors and i am sure other tvs
gave it five stars because it really is nice to extend the screen and use your nook as a streaming server to your tv
nice they made such a device .
this item is just as was described in the original description , works without any issues to be seen
good product
bought for a spare for my 9&<HASHTAG> ; nook hd and it fit perfectly
very satisfied with the price much less than on the bn site
my son crewed my hd charger cord so i needed another one , this is exactly like the one my son destroyed .
this is a good beefy <NUM> amp charger , but it covers two outlets on a power strip
it is ok in a regular wall outlet
the best thing is it uses a standard usb connector so it can charge more than just a nook ( i have a kindle fire hd+ ) .
i lost my b&n original cable
i looked around for an new one
i tried a different , cheaper model but it didn not fit my device properly so back to the drawing board
i ordered this one
i am satisfied
it works exactly as expected and fits perfectly
i would recommend this product to anyone looking for a spare or in lieu of the original usb cable adapter .
it does 2a and charges a dead nook in a few hours
it does so with a lot of heat , compared to most wall worts
i have a dual charger where <NUM> port is 2
1a and the other is 1a for total output of 3
1a that doesn not run as hot as this
and i use that to power a raspberry pi to avoid needing a powered hubit does the job adequately as it is designed to
just hot
i would always unplug it if not using ( even though it cools off ) because of the amount of heat made
the nook hd+ runs hot too right where you hold it on the left side in portrait , but not so much when charging
i guess it is better to have it at the plug .
go to target or barnes and noble instead , and pay $25 ( which is still a huge markup , considering they make the thing for <NUM> cents
) this is the worst option if you need one of these
it is price gouging , pure and simple .
works well , a little pricey i think for a charging cable , but then again , not losing the original would be a lot cheaper than any replacement
this is a great buy , compared to a $60 or more a retail store .
this mount is just what i needed
it is strong and sturdy
it folds almost flat to enable the television to sit square and flat against the wall if desired and extends and rotates for angle turns
a perfect fit as long as you match the correct visa pattern for your television .
great deal , easy to mount and it appears to be fairly sturdy
i mounted a <NUM> in tv on it and it works great .
this mount works really well once you get it up and going
only problem is just the arms are a little goofy getting them all in the right spot
but that is really not too big an issue considering all the different tv is and their mounting hole locations .
this wall mount does everything it is supposed to do
the piece that attaches to the wall isn not overly long , which made it easier to mount the arm in the tight space i needed to mount it in
the only issues i saw was that the joints were very tight initially and as we moved the arm around to install it , the joints loosened up to the point where i had to take the included allen wrench and tighten them up again .
for the price you just cant beat this item
i bought it for a house i was selling so i could hang some tv and it worked great
good quality for the price .
i received the mount , which was well packaged for shipping
the installation instructions were moderately clear
no issues following them , they were just a little disjointed depending on the wall surface you were installing on
my shipment had a piece , and was missing <NUM> screws
i contacted the manufacturer , and they shipped me a replacement part and screws the very next day ( shipped out of texas , so normal mailing times applied ) i like how the mount fits together , and i easily mounted my 60lbs tv by myself
the part that attaches to the tv has a hook that will hold the tv on the arm till you bolt it on
it is very adjustable , and pushes almost flush with the wall
i am very happy , but took one star for the miscut piece .
took a bit of work , but used this to fit an older vizio 32&<HASHTAG> ; monitor to the wall to use as a compute monitor
stable and like the ability to move the tv to different angles
the vizio was older and did not have the standard holes , this product fit and holds the tv very stable .
i used this for my 47&<HASHTAG> ; samsung
its fit/feel is great
easy installation
appears strong ; although i personally spent way too much on the tv to risk leaving it fully outstretched with too little lag bolts for a long time ! it is very convenient to be able to move it away from the wall however and i would feel very comfortable tilt or swiveling if needed
the movement is fluid and easily adjustable
i am very pleased with my purchase .
this item serves its purpose as well as any other mount
its most appealing attribute is its large range of motion
i am using this to a 32" tv and it works perfectly to hide the mount , receptacles , and cables behind the tv
very easy installation as well .
i love this mount
this is the 4th one i have bought and it works great every time
excellent seller and excellent product
i am very glad for buying it
it is heavy duty and good quality for the price
it was very easy to install .
this holds up my 55inch sony with ease
make sure u mount this with ur own lag screws into the heart of the 2x4 ur mounting to and u won not have any problem--u may have to make a modificatoin or two but use ur brain and figure it out-- it will be there till the house falls ! 3inch lag screws is the way to go don not be cheap go buy em
---how much did u pay for the tv ?
nice quality still works great
very happy with this purchase
need to add <NUM> more words
so what can i say its a wall mount that i haven not had any problems with
great bracket for small tvs
i used it on a 19" lcd and it worked well
the large mounting plate may block some connections on some tvs
installed easily and could be adjusted to make level
the links were very tight and need to be loosened for initial installation
when the tv is in the desired position , you can tighten them up .
i bought this for a 22" tv for my son
i mounted this onto the corner stud and it works great ! i love the angles it can achieve
fees very sturdy and well built
it works perfect for my application
very happy with this purchase !
i am using this mount for a <NUM> inch vizio tv and it has been great
the installation process was quick and easy and we love the variety of angles that you can get from this mount
we have it on a side wall in our bedroom and we can pull the tv out and move it completely perpendicular to the wall on which it is mounted if we want to
( we don not usually move it quite perpendicular , but it works to do this
) my only complaint is that the joints are a little on the stiff side
it takes quite a bit of force to move the tv from one position to another
it is a little hard for my wife to do-- especially with the tv mounted about 6ft up on the wall
it may be possible to loosen these pivot points , but i have not tried
i am a little nervous about making it less stable if i do
overall , it is a great mount
highly recommended .
i installed this for my sister who had a 22" philips lcd
nice sturdy mount , with all of the nuts , bolts , screws included
only problem was that since my tv was so small , and i was using the most inner mounting hols on the mount , the outside edges of the mount covered both the cable connection , and the power cable connection
instead of returning , ( then paying $70 from a local store ) i simply went to a hardware store , got a <NUM> & 1/2 inch boring tool that attaches to a hand drill , and drilled holes into the mount
it was pretty easy , but a bit messy
it is not visible after mounting the tv , so who cares ? it is one thing to consider before buying this , there may be another mount that does not cover your tv connections
otherwise swivels well , does not sag , good value .
didn not think it would work as well as it has , because the metal was a lighter guage thanwe expected , but it hardly deflected from theweight of the tv , even extended straight out .
very heavy duty construction , extends , tilts perfectlya steal at this pricewill be happy to buy another <NUM> or <NUM> if needed
well constructed wall mount for tv sets up to <NUM> inches
the mounting plate has numerous holes for varius sets
plenty of extra hardware provided
price was about 1/8th of what it would cost on the open market
i recommend it highly .
i used it to mount a 32" lcd tv to the wall
about 28lbs
i installed it in less than 1/2 hour and am very happy with the results
pros : -comes with all of the hardware you will with some extra hardware of which i have no idea what it is there for
i suspect it is a 'universal' hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models , but it is nice to have a little 'extra' ( which is always better than not enough ! ) -the included level is nice
well it is cheap but it works ! -the instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit
cons : -metal is just a tad on the flimsy side
i have no problems trusting it with my &lt ; 30lb television but if i were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of 55lbs , i think i would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up
-the holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud
i think the particular stud i was installing it onto was a typical 2x4 and if centered , the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud
i had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud , and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud
as a result , i was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place , but i don not feel it will be an issue with my 28lb television
if your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn not even be an issue
-the metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it
i mounted the base just a little bit "off level" to help compensate for this , and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me
conclusion : all in all it is not a bad unit
especially for the price
yes i would have liked to see a sturdier unit , but when you take into account the &lt ; $30 price tag , it is an excellent bargain
i don not think i will have any issue with a static mounting of my tv in the corner of the bedroom *but* if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic , constant repositioning , etc
then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier .
this mount is excellent
it is very well built and sturdy
i used it to mount a 32" tv and it fit the need perfectly
the price was also very good and much , much cheaper than what an inferior mount would cost in a retail store
i would definitely recommend .
works great and is so much cheaper than the more expensive versions at the big box stores
it is super easy to install yourself too
you just need a drill and a ratchet set to get it into the stud ( oh yea a stud finder too ) .
we bought this for the tv in our gym as it gets moved around a bit
it is definitely sturdy and works well
our tv in there is 24&<HASHTAG> ; ,
for the price , you can not beat it
mine didn not come with any of the screws for the tv , but luckily i had some leftover from another mount so i didn not want to bother returning it
also , not sure what they mean by tilt , but mine doesn not
the arm extends in and out as said , tv swivels left to right , but does not tilt up and down as was my expectation
otherwise , can not beat it for the price as in target/best buy etc
, these are going for $60+ .
cannot beat this deal anywhere else on the web ! all other retailers are for what you are getting - a couple pieces of fabricated metal to hold a tv that articulates ! this mount is reasonably priced
pros : easy to install ( helps to have a cordless driver to drill <NUM> pilot holes , and to drive in <NUM> lag screws
you also need to have a stud finder )
- well fabricated- mount does everything advertised ( i
articulates - you made need to loosen up some nuts ) con is : really stretching here since this is a good deal : instructions could use some help for the "novice" diy'ersinstall tip : it really helps if you have a second person assisting you for the final step of mounting the flat panel to the tv mountinstalled a 15
5 lbs , <NUM> inch flat panel lcd ( vesa 200mm x 100mm ) to this mount
mount works beautifully ! i originally had the tv sitting a little high on a stand , but then the picture was not as good because of the upward viewing angle of the screen ( inherent problem with cheaper lcd is - not being directly in front of a lcd screen ) - this mount corrected this issue by allowing me to "tilt down" the screen
i would strongly recommend this mount if you are in the market .
this mount is easy to install and very sturdy and is very functional and very affordable for the price
works like a charm ! lies flat on the wall when i want it too and pulls out and swivels like a charm when i need it too ! the instructions call for it to be mounted into a stud in the wall , however mine is mounted directly into the drywall using heavy duty anchors and it works perfect as well ! this is a great product for an amazing price !
easey to put together and install
used to mount a 37" led flat screen
instuction say to mount the complete unit but if you mount the tv to the back plate on the ground first its a one person job
well built product for being made in china
wish you could buy american made , better luck next time .
i hung this in my house with great ease and it held up my <NUM> year old son because i wasn not going to put the 55&<HASHTAG> ; flat screen on it to find out that it failed
fully extends out <NUM> feet
this was worth the money .
wanted the monitor off of the desk , so we mounted on the wall
i would have rather had a vertical adjustment as well , but for the price , this unit does the job .
very secure , we did have to use concrete bolts thought since we were putting it on an outside wall made of lath and plaster with concrete brick on the outside
one of the best features is there is one piece that attaches to the tv and another that attaches to the wall
the piece on the tv actually hooks onto the piece on the wall
i am really happy with this purchase .
i live in a studio condo and i needed something to rotate to see from my bed and my couch on the other side of the main room
once you figure out which instructions to use ( several varieties are included to accommodate different scenarios and tvs ) , they are pretty thorough
don not be afraid to tighten specific &<HASHTAG> ; joints&<HASHTAG> ; and loosen others to get it how you want it
originally had bought a different one , and be careful of this , but it didn not didn not have near the amount of swing as this one does .
holds the tv fine and the articulation is great
we use it in a downstairs bedroom where we can move it to be seen from the bed or the treadmill
has cable mgmt as well .
another great buy from amazon
the local stores wanted twice the money and the other mounts were cheaply made
this mount is made well and you get a free hdmi cable and level with it
just to know that the tv will sit off center of where the base is placed
other than that it has held up and worked .
this is the best mount i have ever found , especially for the price
home depot has a nearly identical mount for $90
this mount comes with every fastener you could need from lags , hollow wall anchors , spacers , to varying lengths of metric fasteners to most if not all tvs
they mount easy and are sturdy ; i have a 60&<HASHTAG> ; led tv on one without issue
i also have 32&<HASHTAG> ; , 42&<HASHTAG> ; , 46&<HASHTAG> ; , and 50&<HASHTAG> ; tvs on them ; i have used these to mount every led/lcd tv i or friends have mounted .
quality was excellent
instructions were clear
it was not clear about a tilt feature , but there was enough to level it when i finished
be careful to get the wall bracket real vertical
( i was using it for a <NUM> inch computer screen so i really need it to be level for reading
) everything i needed plus lots of extra hardware for different situations .
in the process of turning our master bedroom into a fortress of solitude for my wife , we decided to mount ourpanasonic 720p lcd hdtvon the wall , above the dresser , to save some space
( you can never have enough dresser space for displaying tchotchkes , amirite , fellas ? ) my wife wanted a fixed wall mount but i thought the viewing angle required some articulation
( in hindsight , fixed would have worked , too
) this unit was highly rated and the price was right
the installation was straightforward and fairly simple
the only point at which i needed some help was in balancing the tv while i attached it to the arm ; otherwise it was all me
i think it looks great ; my wife says it reminds her of being in the hospital
( sorry , honey
) when we mount thepanasonic viera 1080p plasma hdtvin the living room , i will definitely use a flat mount
you could spend four times this much on an articulating tv mount , but i don not see why you would .
i gave this mount <NUM> stars
5 to start because out of the box , and mounted on the wall , i really liked it for my daughter is room
the ability to move her 26" tv around so she can play in other areas of the room is a welcomed addition
i subtracted <NUM> star because of the tacky instructions and poor cable management for something that moves at maximum , about <NUM> feet away from the wall
1 more star fell off because now that the tv is mounted , the mount seems to sag , even though there are two huge lag bolts in a stud mounting it
that parts not the problem , the problem is where the tv mounts to the plate itself , it seems no matter how many washers you use , it just does not make full contact
also if you move the tv to a new position the mounts seems to want to "fall" in that direction on its hinges
so it must be releveled by yanking on it every time it moves
otherwise , it works i guess
but for $50 i'd rather have a stationary mount that i never have to worry about
i would not set a tv larger than a 30" or so on this
i just don not trust it .
for the price , this wall mount is great
not too hard to install
the only reason i didn not give it a <NUM> star is wire management
i could not get the little loop to work
not a big deal at all however
overall , i highly recommend this product
well worth the money .
needed a corner mounted flatscreen
this did the job well , easy to install
i had to mount in a metal stud , so i used two support boards in the back to distribute the weight more evenly
expectations of item met at a fraction of the cost from competitors .
i'd never bought one of these , mainly due to the high prices in the retail stores
i hadn not looked online much , and hadn not really needed a monitor mounting device until recently
this thing is well built , and it does the job
it is not fancy but if you are just looking for an inexpensive way to hang a monitor ( tv or pc ) on the wall this will do the job
it comes with a nice bag of hardware
it is primarily designed for mounting tv sets , but you can get it to work with a pc monitor , as long as it has the vesa mounting
it mainly articulates and
it will pivot a bit up and down , but that is limited .
only gave this four stars because it is only supporting a 32&<HASHTAG> ; tv
i think i would be scared to mount a 55&<HASHTAG> ; tv on it
if you sprang for a 50&<HASHTAG> ; or bigger tv , spend a little more on a properly rated mount
as with any tv mount , make sure you are hitting wall studs with the main screws , don not just use anchors in drywall or you are asking for trouble
lots of hardware included in the kit , so mounting any style or brand of tv shouldn not be a problem .
nothing fancy , just decent quality and simple installation
as may have been mentioned , one must discard the provided phillips screws that the manufacturer provides to affix the bracket to the wall stud
use your own
the tv i mounted with it is an older , so it is a little heavier than the news ones
this thing isn not fazed , and stays where i put it .
amazing how easy it is to move my 46&<HASHTAG> ; around on this mount and able to hang off one stud
nice quality feel to metal it is made of .
very sturdy
the arm is very stiff at first so you have to work it lose
however , the mount works great , just make sure you get that stud just right
i was impressed with the quality and happy with the price .
don not have anything to really complain about
except there doesn not seem to be a way , or i am missing it to tilt the tv up or down ( ie
mounted high on the wall and pointed down towards the chair )
and i am quite savvy with tools/assembly/etc
and it is difficult to get to the bolt heads on the back of the tv to adjust the angle
no reason to not buy it though .
bought the mount for my 30&<HASHTAG> ; dell u3011 monitor
it fits the dell quite well , and i bought it for it is reach from the wall , it is ability to manipulate , and it is weight capacity
and in all those respects , i am quite happy
however , there is a noticeable tilt/sag to the monitor when i have the arm extended
i am not so concerned with sag perpendicular to the wall , as that was expected , but the rotational sag that i sometimes get .
the mount plate and the extender arms need to be screwed together and there are two holes for each arm to attach to the corner of the plate
the holes don not align so i couldn not put two screws in
i just used one screw which is not the most secure attachment
then i used zip ties to secure the arm better
i did this because i had to install the tv asap and could not wait for a replacement
also , the mounting bracket that attaches to the wall has a larger screw hole on the bottom
this means that the bottom can wiggle and the bracket will be misaligned
again , i did a quick fix
i gave this <NUM> stars and not <NUM> because it actually stayed up on the wall and is now holding my tv , albeit due to my own ingenuity and not the quality of the mount
i should not have to do quick fixes on a product like this .
very happy , it looks great , i am so happy we got it
holds good , it is a lil hard to get it to the wall
other then that its fine i love how we have more room in our room
my husband is so happy i ordered this , it only cost us $28 free shipping and fast ( : very thankful to the seller .
i wasn not willing to pay $100 for simply mounting a tv , so i bought this item to give it a shot
i have no real complaints
it holds the tv up , which is all i wanted
it does not have smooth pivot points , so if you are planning on moving it around a lot , don not use this one , but if it is going to stay in a static area , this is your mount .
bought new but i could tell right away that mine had been repackaged and refurbished
plus the was missing the <NUM> arms but had some other random hardware included
i made mine work for my 32&<HASHTAG> ; set and it serves it is purpose
just wish the seller was upfront on the condition , i could have bought a used one for $5 less .
this is a rather good tv mount
this tv mount works exactly as expected and described
i would buy again .
i had to use a hacksaw to cut away part of this to hang my 24&<HASHTAG> ; led tv in my bedroom
other than that , seems to work fine .
i have a 42&<HASHTAG> ; hannspree lcd tv
it weighs 42
5 lbs
most other reviews said they had a tv smaller than this so i was a little skeptical but got it because of the good price and it said it could hold <NUM> or so lbs
most of my reservation was because it was the first time i have mounted a tv and worried it would fall within a week
i have had it over a month and its nice to have it be able to swing out , extend , and angle
i like the fact that i can get a bigger tv and still use this mount as its in my living room
it was not too hard to install
i bought a stud finder because i didn not have one and most everything else i already had to install it
i do highly recommend recruiting some help with the install , at least for when putting the tv on
this would be extremely hard by yourself , especially if you have a bigger tv
overall , very happy with this mount .
installed easy and in no time at all ( finding the stud was the hardest part for me )
articulates well with the 40&<HASHTAG> ; tv on it
i would not hesitate to look for this brand when it is time for the next tv mount .
i have two of these now in different rooms
works well with my samsung tv is for the size noted above
we got this one recently and its a great wall mount
the unit is pretty heavy , so you will need a helper
it also includes a variety of screws to mount also
our tv documentation stated it was a 400x400 pattern
but after putting hte plate over the back , seems we didn not need the extra extenders as its 200x200
this is on a samsung 40&<HASHTAG> ; <NUM> series ledtv
the arm is hard to push and pull , but that is more due to being new and stiff
make sure you adjust the tilt angle screws as our unit came with them loose so we had to tighten them
i initially was scared to mount it ( what if it falls if i screw up ! ) but its pretty easy
not only did i use a stud finder to get the general location of the stud , but i also used nails to get the actual edges ( those basic studfinders are never &<HASHTAG> ; exact&<HASHTAG> ; )
make sure you do the same
not bad for $
this is a good product
it went up easily
i did it myself
i wish i might have gotten one with a little more adjustment
it is very rigid .
i have purchased <NUM> of these wall mounts and they hold my <NUM> and <NUM> inch flat screens perfectly
i love these and highly recommend them .
very good item ; i am happy wit it , and delivery time was excellent ! i recomended ; is a good support for your led tv
it is easy to install , and it have extra screws for different sizes tv .
this was perfect for my 24" led monitor , i had it up in just a few mins and with no problems
it included a small bubble level and it also came with a 6' hdmi cable which i was not expecting .
i checked around amazon as well as some other sites , and decided these were what i needed
i read the reviews , looked at the pictures and bought two of these
i received them today
i unpacked one of them , read the instructions and immediately filled out the return request for amazon
these mounts are very , very heavy and require 6 , yes six , screws to mount to the wall
are you kidding me ? the tvs are only <NUM> lbs ! two screws in the studs and then more damage to the wall than is necessary
what a joke ! and lag bolts ? ever heard of screws ? the other issue is that these are very hard to move
i bought an articulating wall mount for a reason , and i expect them to be able to move without a wrench in my hand .
installed easily , has a nice long reach
attached a 32&<HASHTAG> ; tv for the grandkids and it works out great
accomodates many different size tv is and was a very good price .
for the price
can not be beat
i have two tv is hanging in the living room
no issues , easy to hang
i would recommend to a friend .
works great
holds my <NUM> inch tv effortlessly
very well built
definitely worth the price
easy to install tv to the mount
has cord clips
tv can be tilted up or down and sideways
extends from the wall <NUM> inches
i highly recommend this brand .
used this with a panasonic <NUM> inch lcd
very durable and works as advertised
it was advertised as fitting 22"-37" televisions , but the size of the t
v mounting plate is so large that it covers some of the plug connections on the back of the television
i will have to cut the metal plate to get to the p
c connector if i choose to connect a computer
haven not decided if i will keep or send back to get something with a smaller mounting plate
other than that , it is a great product and meets my need for a hanging television .
i have a 47&<HASHTAG> ; tv and had no place to put it in my bed room
with this mount it use the space i had a poster hanging
very easy to install , came with all hard ware .
great mount , so many areas of articulation
this was a great gift idea my mother loves it
i have purchased two of them and they are sturdy and give a touch of class to every room you put them in
a must have any video file or those who want to save space in a bedroom or office .
this is perfect for what i needed it for
i can move the screen from side to side if i need to and i don not have the tv sitting on my desk .
have not had the opportunity to install the tv mount as of yet - will follow up once mounted in place
great price and quick shipping
why pay the $$$$ at best buy when you can get the same products for a fraction of the prices here
the videosecu long arm tv wall mount low profile full motion works great .
pro is : easy to setup
supports many different vesa formats
has some articulation
sturdy construction
can be installed by one person w/o too much effort
con is : cable guides fall off easily
the joints are a bit too stiff ; you really have to it to get it fully extended , and you have to push fairly hard to get it to compact again
so far i have not noticed any wear from this firm pulling/pushing , but i worry because it is only attached to the studs buy <NUM> bolts .
we bought this for a 55&<HASHTAG> ; vizio and it worked perfectly
i would buy it again and recommend it
good quality .
i am impressed with the solid design of this tv wall mount
i think this weights more than the 26" tv it is supporting
it also has lots of logical adjustments so leveling the tv isn not too difficult
the one semi negative is that it takes a fair amount of force to reposition the tv
this does assure the tv stays put but if you plan to move the tv on the stand a lot this may be a negative
overall i am pleased with the stand - it seems like a good value .
i bought the uint for a <NUM> &<HASHTAG> ; tando
i couldn not get the parts to line up so i bought another fixed type .
very well made , strong mount the only problem i have is the instructions are very poorly written or detailed
pictures do not distinguish between stud mount and concrete
also the instructions do not tell you the size of the included boltsfor those of you who have never worked in the home building industry wall studs are usually 1
5 inches wide so this mount only requires <NUM> lag bolts in the middle holes to secure it to the wall to support a <NUM> lb tv
the four outboard holes on the wall mount are 1
3" apart so don not try to use them in a wall stud measuring 1
5" wide
helpful hint : i have help install at least <NUM> other wall mounts because of family or friends so i cannot say that i am an expert but my suggestion is to drill pilot holes which the instructions do not tell you to do
after comparing the instructions on this unit to others i have installed i still must say that the pictures should have a lot more detail
some complain that the back plate was too big for the tv they used but it is fits perfect on thelg 32lk450 1080p 60hz lcd hdtvi am using it on
works perfectly for the area of the room i am using it in which allows me to rearrange the room without the need to move the tv .
perhaps i misunderstood how to install the mount , but i : 1 ) installed the mount to the wall ( easy enough ) 2 ) attach tv the mount with some screws ( difficult for one person ) with one arm i held the tv ( heavy ! )
the other arm was trying to attach some small screws connecting the tv to the mount
it took quite an effort to hold the tv for that long
certainly having two people installing this would be waaaay easier : - ) i have another similar mount where the tv back plate and the mount are separate parts
so once the back plate is installed , you slide the connecting parts together
much easier ! : - )
it took about <NUM> mins to install this tv wall mount with a <NUM> inch samsung tv
it does the job , there are much more expensive arms , but this does the trick .
i used this to hang my 40&<HASHTAG> ; lcd that i bought back in 07 , so it is a heavy tv that outweighs my new 50&<HASHTAG> ;
everything seems to be made well , it was easy to install myself , and the tv has been hanging for <NUM> months now from a brick wall at it is full reach
i can not imagine paying $100 for other tv wall mounts , as well as this one performs .
you can not beat the price and the installation was simple as can be
we installed it in our office and it is perfect ! no problems and was completed in a matter of minutes
totally love this product ! i bought two - one for living room , one for bedroom
i decided to try my hand in the bedroom first ( in case i got frustrated and didn not finish the project )
i have gotten items needing to be assembled before with all the hardware in one bag -- not so with this product ! i am impressed ! every nut , bolt , screw , washer , etc
is clearly packaged ( individually by size and labeled ! ) the arm also comes assembled -- which i disassembled for easier handling ( the wall plate is attached to the arm with two carriage bolts / easy to remove and makes holding in place while bolting to the wall a breeze )
took me /2 hours from start ( gathering my tools ) to finish ( hanging the tv ) oh , and i am a <NUM> yr old disabled female
i do have a lot of construction/tool knowledge however .
update : i have now have purchased <NUM> of these for work and home and with the lighter led tv is this is a perfect mount for most sizes - this is a great mount - easy to install - easy to use - easy to expand - easy to mount tvs
i havent found another one that is so useful - even if you dont need it to extend this is still a great mount--- i guess for the price i was expecting something cheaper but i was quite surprised
it was easy to install and works for what i need it for - it may be over kill for a <NUM> inch led lcd tv but i like the way it can be moved around .
used this for the bedroom
put it in the corner but was only able to hit the stud with a couple bolts .
the videosecu line of articulating wall mounts has become our standard of choice for high quality articulating wall mounts within our home
the value is such that the convenience of having an articulating wall mount for connecting or reconnecting cables is well worth the few bucks required to mount our hdtvs conveniently to the wall
highly recommend this great quality product
this wall mount will secure any of the hdtvs using the vesa <NUM> or vesa <NUM> mount pattern
we like to use a mount on the larger end than actually needed so if we later upgrade the hdtv with a larger size there is a much better chance we won not need to replace the articulating mount .
you can spend a ton of money on one of these , or you can buy this one
hung a <NUM> inch tv with it with no problems .
this is a really well made and engineered product which should be twice the price
it has every kind of leveling and tilting adjustment you could want , and a nice finishing piece that goes over the wall plate and lag bolts
the mounting process can not be rushed and planning everything out before you start makes all the difference
just make sure you find the middle of a wall stud for the lag bolts
it easily managed a 47&<HASHTAG> ; led lcd which weighs 35lbs , and it might take the extra lbs of a 55&<HASHTAG> ; led lcd if it is not pulled too far from the wall
since it can swing out over 20&<HASHTAG> ; i'd be carefull about going bigger than the 35lb 47&<HASHTAG> ; tv that i mountedthe only thing which was dissappointing were the two plastic wire holders which are junk ( very flimsy , one was broken in the package ) and shouldn not be included when simple black wire ties work far better .
my flat screem computer monitor is very light and didn not need such a heavy duty mount
the product is fine and would work for monitors much larger and heavier than my 20&<HASHTAG> ; led
the mount i purchased is great
it is designed for tv is 32&<HASHTAG> ; and under
the link here , and image are not correct
but , i really thought the mount was build well , was easy to install , and the price was fantastic .
tv has been on wall for a long time
hasn not fallen off
it is metal and considerably cheaper than kits available in stores .
this is exactly what i needed
it was easy to mount and supports my <NUM> inch tv ( 26 lbs ) without any issue
i haven not tested the extension brackets , but the rest of the device is very solid
i will say that the hinges can be a bit tight , and it is not designed to be easily adjustable on the fly ( you will need a few tools )
if you plan on swinging your tv around a lot , this might not be the best choice , but it works perfectly fine if you only need to adjust it every now and then
my favorite part is the small base
i didn not have a lot of wall space to mount a tv , and this met my needs without eating all my money
keep in mind that you will want at least two people to mount the tv on this device
i attached my tv alone by precariously balancing it on a stack of boxes while i inserted the screws
speaking of which , i have mounted two tvs on this , and the box included screws which fit both ( in addition to many more )
however , you may need a few more washers .
this tv mount i bought for just $25 easily outdoes similar ones that cost over $100 ! it comes preassembled , is easy to mount on the wall , and has clear instructions
it also features a wire holder and cover for the screws on the wall
the joints are a little bit stiff , but with use and maybe a drop of oil this shouldn not be a problem
definetely a great buy at a agreat price !
i have purchased this mount twice now - one for my bedroom tv , and one for my living room tv
the bedroom tv is a 35" lcd , and the tv in the living room is a 55" led
( surprisingly enough , they both weigh <NUM> pounds
) this mount works very well for both of them
it is relatively simple to install - you just need to find a stud and screw the support in to it
( i will admit that my bedroom tv has been attached not to a wall stud , but a support brace on a cabinet
it is still there and attached after <NUM> months
) i will say that the joints in the arms are quite stiff - it can take a little muscle to move the tv
but i think i prefer that - it certainly doesn not feel flimsy , and it stays wherever i put it
a tip for purchasers : make sure your tv supports this mount
you can usually find your compatible vesa patterns in your user is manual
( or a quick online search , perhaps
) as i often say - when buying online , it pays to do your homework .
amazon as always <NUM> stars in service and shipping
the mount was for a vizio e260mv
product comes adequate with a lot of screws , an alan key and standard nut key that fits all the nuts
the bubble level ( with magnet on the side ) and cable are a nice addition
had to cut <NUM> inch from the top and bottom of the base that gets screwed no to the tv , since it covered some of the inputs
other wise very practical for my bedroom/study that has more width so the convenience of swirling is why we wanted this and it does a good job
for the price ( $25 and free shipping ) , its is a really good deal
would recommend this .
this device is somewhat weak even for the <NUM> inch tv weighing only 31lbs that i am using it with
after some adjusting it is working ok .
easy to install and the tv is still on the wall after three weeks ! i consider this a good value for the money
very easy to setup , simple instructions , has all the mounting hardware and fits a huge different variety of tv is with great support .
very concerned over hanging a 46&<HASHTAG> ; tv on the wall
got this mount due to low price
very impressed
no doubt it will handle a 30# tv
allows full <NUM> degree rotation with 21&<HASHTAG> ; from wall to centerline at maximum extension .
another gem hidden amoungst the amazon halls
this works well for my led tv is
i used the heavy duty mount bolts for mounting my tv on the back porch
i hung on the sucker and it is not coming down
and i am 190lbs !
it needs improment
i wish it has one more hole to put a screw on the wall
it looks shaky for <NUM> inch tv
however , it still holds it .
quickly shipped to my house and mounted myself
i ordered this for my <NUM> inch phillips lcd tv and for the price i paid its a great value
does the job that any other higher priced wall mounts can do
would recommand
very good materials , very lightweight , cheaper than others brands
i have a 47&<HASHTAG> ; lg led tv and it fit at <PERCENT> , and i am capable of sell my tv , buy an 55&<HASHTAG> ; and use the same mount without problems .
made in china , but this time , its well made
nice and sturdy and lots of options to mount differenct type of lcd
it has a good viewing set of angles and can be adjusted just about any view you want
the value for cost here is big , since most of these sale for over 75
00 , or over 100
00 at wm
im pleased with it .
mount went up easily and seems sturdy enough
however , adjusting the tv sometimes leaves the tv crooked
also , it is almost impossible to adjust tilt without using the provided tools
even after using the tools , we couldn not really adjust the tilt to the full amount .
great functionality , really incredible price , and a snap to install
honestly , ridiculously good product - wish they were all so easy .
quick and easy installation - very solid product
very pleased with this purchase
when in need of this type mount again i will certainly purchase this brand/model again
great price on amazon makes it very easy .
excellent buy ! we are very pleased with this item
it performs very well
the instructions were clear
it was easy to assemble
it holds a 47&<HASHTAG> ; tv very well .
warning , do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount ! mom and dad bought a <NUM> inch seiki tv and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing
that is where i the eldest son came into the picture ( pun intended )
i knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall , which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall
but what if it was a typical installation , would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely ? it seems unlikely most people would , so what are the options ? option <HASHTAG>
buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small <NUM> hole bracket as on this model
if you don not know what i am talking about , look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud , and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv
this model has only a small wall bracket with holes for <NUM> screws or anchors
option <HASHTAG>
use wall anchors
again , there are only <NUM> holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors
proceed at your own risk
option <HASHTAG>
install a stud
you are on your own with this
the mount is well made , everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned , a little homework will save you time and make installation easy
i hope this review is useful
: - )
too heavy and poor weld quality
lot of blow holes in welding , though painting was made nice to cover it or else it was made with inefficient welder
i think this is is not well designed by experts
hope no calculations are involved in making it
just copied the shape forms some other manufacturer .
i bought a funky double hinged wall mount from amazon and it did not work
i went to best buy and they said to purchase this $350 wall mount they had , i snagged a pic of the measurements and extension ability from the box , came home and found this one to be near similar
needless to say i now have my <NUM> in lg flat screen securely mounted and sitting pretty in the corner of my living room .
i have <NUM> swivel mounts and this one is not the best
if you don not use the swivel feature frequently or don not place it where it may be bumped it will do the job
i prefer the strength and stability offered by mounts which have two arms extending from a longer wall bracket
these more stable brackets can be found at similar or slightly higher prices
also look for a feature which allows the tv bracket ( and tv ) to be lifted off the swivel arm more conveniently .
just in stall another samsung 55&<HASHTAG> ; led flat screen
outside a patio deck area what a difference this unit made
the mounting kit was very easy to use
again i did upgraded to using longer heavier mounting bolts
that was only $1
00 more but it is worth it in the long run
here in earthquake country you nees that support
your flatscreen tv retracts a few inches off the wall plus it will look sweet from 2&<HASHTAG> ; to 24&<HASHTAG> ; from wall area
for a good wall mount of a smaller tv , this is perfect
much cheaper than similar in various stores , and actually is more flush/compact than i have seen on others with all the adjustments you could want
only gripe is that the included wrench to tighten the wall bolts is pretty weak and strips itself almost immediately , but it will work to get it on at least
all hardware needed is included , i had to use a few adapter pieces on my first tv
getting ready to hook a second one up on another rooms wall , both are 32" screens
i feel confident they will be there until i decide to remove em
wall stud mounting required , but depending on the stud size , you may only get two of the three wall bolts into the stud
should be enough though .
i use this arm to mount my <NUM> inch vizio
i am surprised my tv has a 100x100 mount thingy
it can tilt left and right , up and down
i do wish it swiveled the tv so that it wasn not crooked
when the bolts get loose , my tv looks crooked .
was a perfect fit for my 32&<HASHTAG> ; flat screen tv
i would recommend this wall mount for that size tv
good wall mount
sturdy and does what it is supposed to do
in fact , it even held a larger tv than what it was listed as capable of holding
i believe i mounted a 42&<HASHTAG> ; television with this one
not a one either
i mounted an older heavy thick one .
this was half the price of the tv mounts at costco and perfectly fits a vizio 37&<HASHTAG> ; tv for the spare bedroom
it will work with many different brands so in my book that is great
strong , sturdy and robust .
this is possibly one of the best mounting kits i have ever purchased
i like the fact that there are pieces so the mounting kit can cater to all models of tv
( whether they have a rounded or flat back )
mine had a flat back so i didn not need the extra piece , but once that step was cleared it was only a matter of minutes before it went up on my wall
the adjustable arm is nice , as it is setup in our bedroom
at night the tv is angled towards the bed and makes it super easy for both of us to see up on the wall , and during the day its turned in another direction towards my desk - also making the ability to view the tv while working
the material is very strong , hubby did a pull up on the bar and it didn not even budge
this thing seems as though it will last quite a long time
it is already been up for over a month and it was a wonderful addition to my master bedroom , i will be purchasing more over time for the other rooms in the home with larger model tvs .
exactly as described
very heavy duty
lots of parts to make any installation work
excellent value
fits various monitors and tvs .
i bought three of these mounts for all the bedrooms in my house
i love all three of them
all mounts have different tv is on them , one is a 50&<HASHTAG> ; , 40&<HASHTAG> ; and a 32&<HASHTAG> ;
product comes with multiple screw for different tvs
outstanding product for the price
all tv is have been mount for a little over a year
this product is a full motion mount for $29
99 ! and it is prime !
awesome price and quality
simple and easy to install and fully equipped for installation
if you need a swing arm mount for medium size tv this is one i'd recommend .
i mounted this in my rv and it holds a 26" lcd tv / dvd combo
installation was very easy and the mount works great ! i was prepared to pay <NUM> times the price for a mount that would work as i wanted
i couldn not be happier .
got my tv mounted with this above my pc and its been on the wall for a year now
no problems with it holds the tv well and its study
way cheaper than store bought and its perfect for what i got i got a <NUM> inch hdtv
i really like the action on this mount
i purchased a 27&<HASHTAG> ; monitor for my wife and this mount really frees up the desktop real estate
i would purchase again .
i have an older very heavy 36&<HASHTAG> ; samsung high def tv that weighs substantially more than my new 42&<HASHTAG> ;
i replaced my old basement crt tv with it , installed the videosecu mount easily and it does the job
i was amazed , the price from amazon was only $30 dollars and with prime i got free <NUM> day shipping
the original price was $149
wow , what a reduction !
used this for a panasonic 32" lcd tv
mount works fine , instructions were minimal
i was able to use the supplied hardware to attach the tv and to attach the mount to the wall
i did have a problem hanging the tv , per the instructions you have to mount the unit and now attach the tv , this was not very easy so i removed the mounting plate at the pivor point and took it off the wall mount , mounted this on the tv and now to the tv mount , this was a lot easier .
the product is good and as described
i have a 32&<HASHTAG> ; vizio tv and somehow , this wall mount seems to be a little too weak for my tv
i still managed to mount my tv just fine , but gets a little paranoid that it will give in within the next few months because the mount won not be able to carry it
but the full motion swing feature is amazing ! especially if you are in a larger room .
the tv is still hanging from the wall so that is a good thing
the info for this wall mount says it is good for up to <NUM> lbs
our old phillips 37&<HASHTAG> ; flat screen weighs <NUM> lbs ( including the stand ) and after <NUM> weeks the tv and mount are secured to the wall via a vertical <NUM> x4&<HASHTAG> ; frame member
the mount came with almost every imaginable combination of nuts , bolts and spacers and straps to fit various size and brand tvs
i had no problem coming up with the right combination for my big and heavy old phillips .
bought this mount for a 32inch panasonic led tv
the mount may look cheap , but i found it to be extremely sturdy and a great buy for the price
i strongly recommend it to everyone .
good , strong mount and quality hardware
includes all the different size screws required to attach to tv if yours doesn not have them ( or if you lost them )
there is just the right amount of resistance in the joints for it to stay where you want it but still easy to move around
i mounted a shelf above the tv to get the cable box out of the way and avoid having to run a long hdmi cable through the wall
i took a star only because i received a different unit than the one pictured , it has <NUM> thick arms , rather than the that is shown
honestly i think what i got is more attractive , but i believe that amazon vendors should not substitute different products without authorization
my unit also did not come with the extender arms in the picture , it has a mounting plate with all of the vesa mounting holes in the correct configuration
my tv is 26&<HASHTAG> ; so it fit perfectly
i am sure my 55&<HASHTAG> ; would fit on it too , but i have a different mounting configuration for that one .
very solid
we mounted our flat panel in the bedroom
like the tipping feature and love the articulating feature
we checked prices at stores , big boxes , etc
best price of all including costco .
i bought this tv swing arm mount for my tv from amazon
its been a good one its built heavy duty to hold pretty big tv
i would have anyone of my friends buy this same mount for their tv
it lets you hang it up and out of the way and also you can turn it out or in adjustable to see it from anywhere i set in my living room
this unit is easy to mount on wall and put together by yourself but if you have an extra person around it would make it a little better when holding the tv up when it clips in at top then screw and tighten and adjustments and like everything else i have bought from amazon it ships fast right to your door step .
easy to attach
easy to adjust
very solid and secure
used on a clients 29&<HASHTAG> ; led with built in dvd .
i have my <NUM> inch tv on the wall and it works great
easy to install and came with all the parts
the screws that it comes with for the tv will not fit but you can buy some for <NUM> dollars .
for the money you can not go wrong
yes , it has a litlle play in the mechanism but , you can adjust your mounting to accomodate that
it works great and frees up counter space
i would do it all again
why spend <NUM> times more .
i love this mount ! all the adjustments for tilt and extension are awesome ! holds a sony 32in just fine even fully extended
even bought another
i have this mounted on my wall in my editing studio
it holds a 27" lcd monitor ( about )
it is been up for a week and i don not expect that it will fall down anytime soon .
my students and i used to huddle around laptops to discuss projects
now i have a 47&<HASHTAG> ; tv for display and this mount makes it possible to put it on any wall and swivel it in any direction depending on how many people need to see the screen
really stable , no wiggling
it is a good value , but is not top notch quality
if you extend both arms in the same direction , the tv ( 30 inch ) tilts
however if the arm goes right , then left , the play in the hinges offset each other and it works great .
the mount itself seems fine , it just didn not work with the phillips tv we bought
the 'x' arm things did not line up and if they did then the 'x' parts would have covered the holes for the inputs
we ended up using one we had had around here
seems to be built well though and sturdy
got this to replace a peerless paramount wall mount when i got my new tv
let me start off by saying it works as advertised
but that won not get you <NUM> stars
the problem is installation
maybe it is my own fault for thinking all tv wall mounts worked like the peerless i had
see , that one has a separate tv plate that you screw to the tv first
then you have the second piece ( the actual wall mount ) that you screw to the wall
once that is done , using the bracket mounted on the tv , you hang the tv on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt
one person can easily put a tv on the wall
not so much with this one
yes , i will admit that once it is mounted , it is a more secure connection , but it is the mounting that is the problem
you can not do it alone
depending on the weight of the tv , you will need at least one helper
this mount is one piece , which means that you have to hold the tv to the plate while attaching it with screws
that can get tricky , especially with heavier tvs ( i used it for a while with my old lcd tv which weighs 40+ pounds )
they do get kudos for providing all the screws for all vesa types as well as a regular and an allen wrench
three stars for ease of installation , five stars for usability , for a combined four stars
make sure you get help when installing .
it is up know and should work fine , but it was hard to get it to fit my tv due to the bulge on the bottom , but i made it work and it is on the wall .
very strong for any tv , but i wish that it was little longer i am very happy with it and very strongly recommended .
easy install ! looks great and works great for what we need ! purchased for game room , took <NUM> min
to install and <NUM> min
to set tv on
great !
it is a solid mount and i doubt that it will ever fail to hold the 22" led tv that is mounted on it
my only complaint is that the bolt that attaches the arm to the wall plate is smaller then the hole in the wall plate so when the tv is anything other than parallel to the wall it leans ( up to 1
25" from one side of the tv to the other ~16" ) but for the price i can live with that .
the mount works , but it is unrefined compared to other brands out there
purchased because it was on sale
just ok .
i consider myself to be a good diyer
i have installed mounts for my <NUM> samsung 46" and 55" led tvs with no problems for <NUM> years
so , for this videsecu mount , inspite of poor installation instructions , i carfeully measured all domensions to fit my new 32" samsung led smarttv in a limited kitchen space
my mistake was , based on the diagrams , i assumed that the length of both the swinging arms of the mount ( the single and the double arms ) were of the same length
what a disaster ! after installing the mount when i mounted the tv and folded the arms the tv did not center itself to the wall side of the mount ! it was then that i noticed the inner length of the <NUM> arms is about 4" longer than the outer single arm
in other words once the arms on the mount were fully folded in towards the wall my tv was not centered in the limited space that i had and looked awful
i don not know why the manufacturer did not keep both arms the same length
at least they shd have mentioned it in the instructions
this to me is a major product defect
luckily with amazon i was able to return this mount but had to pay return s&h ; .
works great for a cheap mount
worked great on a 32&<HASHTAG> ; emerson lcd tv
does everything as advertised ! can tighten or loosen joints for easier movement .
we needed something to extend our tv away from the hot pipe for the winter and this wall mount did the trick
it went up with no a problems
it worked out very well !
its a little flimsy and not the easiest to put together , for the price it works
but for the quality i'd go with cheetah .
we needed a wall mount for a 32&<HASHTAG> ; tv that was going to be in the screened in porch
this was one of the brands recommended by the guy that was going to install out wall mount
i can&<HASHTAG> ; t speak to the ease or difficulty of installation but it looks great and we can swivel it if necessary for best viewing angle
it is also pretty sleek so it doesn not butt out too much
it arrived quickly and it didn&<HASHTAG> ; t take the installer long but of course he was a professional
looks great !
it works for the tv i bought but i had to use some of my own washers for the screws
i thought it would have everything .
i have mounted a <NUM> inch old lcd
easy to install
easy to swivel , there is tilt option but it has to be locked by nuts ( it can not be changed without loosing the nuts ) .
i wanted to put my mac in the wall and leave it
this does that well
i don not move it often it seems strong and well built
if you want to move it a lot get something different you have to keep an allen wrench and a crescent wrench in the desk drawer if you plan on moving it a lot
the articulation is sketchy
for my uses and the cheap price this was perfect .
i have purchased a total of <NUM> hdtv wall mounts from the videosecu companyand they are all quality products at a very reasonable price
-tilt tv mount : for stationary tvs up to <NUM> inches
-articulating : corner mount for small arm : corner or high mobility mount for larger tvsall of them are excellent products , and very easy to install .
received this item quickly and well packaged ( but not so well that i was infuriated trying to open it ) everything was in perfct order
strong , handsome appearance
installation kit is perfectly in order and gives a ton of options for different senarios
couldn not possibly be happier with this product .
could offer a little more in flexibility of installation , but once in place the set can be placed in just the right position repeatedly .
the directions stink
just remember the spacers go under the arms if you have to use them and you will be ok .
it is better than spending twice the money on this going into a brick and mortar store
was very pleased .
good quality
must mount on a stud
i mounted to a metal stud by cutting a rectangle hole in wall , adding a <NUM> ft 2x4 in the metal stud track , patched the hole and then put up the mount
holds a 37&<HASHTAG> ; tv without a problem , even added a dvd player to the bottom of the tv and it is still on the wall after about <NUM> months
price on this item was great and it was sent with free freight !
this item didn not disappoint
it is sturdy , has all the screws included for different flat screen models and yes , it works well .
this worked perfect
the universal design would fit <PERCENT> of the tv is as advertised
easy to mount and very durable .
i have a full 42&<HASHTAG> ; hd flat screen mounted on this
not only does everything look better than strapped to a table , but the adjustability makes this mount a pleasure to have
it was simple to attach to the wall and has a small footprint , being a single stud wall mount
the other major point of this mount is how many sized tv or monitors the mount can be adjusted to accept
my tv mounts solidly and the mount itself is solid , yet adjusts with little effort
this is just plainly a good and solid product that is well worth the money .
had a couple of guys put this up for me , but they said it was easy to install
i like the fact that i can move it around easily and tilt it anyway i want it to be .
this product is user friendly and versatile
it is easy to install and comes with everything needed for installation
adding bidding could drill and bit
it was so easy to install
the instructions were simple and so was the process
i was putting off the project for fear
i should have hung the tv long ago .
works great was pretty easy to put up and does the trick
it is my sons room and really works great .
i am very happy with this affordable wall mount for my sony 32" internet tv
one nice feature ist that you can swivel the mounted tv depending on where you are seated .
i have a 26" lcd monitor mounted on unit
seems sturdy enough , would prefer a more fluid motion and a way to adjust the pivot of the screen without tools
as it is i keep it loose and it is reasonbly adjustable
for the price i certanily can not complain and would recommend this unit .
easy to install , and works great
television moves with ease and always feels secure
doesn not loosen over time like other television mounts .
this was for a <NUM> inch lcd
easy to install and works great
i am very satisfied with this wall mount .
fits many different size tv is , is very solid , and was easy to install
i would recommend to anyone is even slightly handy .
i am using this with my 32" tv and i love it
the price is significantly lower than what you can find for monitor wall mounts in the retail stores ( walmart , best buy )
i found this to be an easy install and very secure
the swivel is smooth and i can orient my television perfectly
it also has plenty of vesa mount patterns so it will hold just about any tv .
for such a cheap mount , it works well
i installed in in about <NUM> minuets and use it to hole a 32" vizio led .
this was a present for myself , my son installed it , in about <NUM> minutes , and i couldn not be happier
i wasn not sure this was for me as it for my bedroom , but my husband and i love it
so easy to move the tv no matter where you are in the room
a great buy .
mounting the tv after mounting on wall can be a handful
it would have been nice to have some type of slide in mount for the tv so you did not have to hold it while putting in <NUM> screws
that would make diy one person installation easier .
when we first bought our bedroom tv , we looked at the mounts in the store and almost fell over from shock at the prices
this is one of the best prices i have found on mounts
this mount went up easy and moves in all directions to get the perfect viewing angle
it comes with everything you need but the drill and tv ! you won not be disappointed with this brand .
if i need to order another , this will be the one
i used this to mount a tv to the wall in my basement and it allows me to pull the tv out from the wall and turn it towards my desk so i can watch tv while working on the pc , nearly a <NUM> degree angle
my tv is only a 32&<HASHTAG> ; and i could see that this would work up to a 40&<HASHTAG> ; or so , but if you don not need to turn the tv <NUM> degrees , you could get by with a larger tv .
i was hesitant about mounting my larger flat screen ( 47&<HASHTAG> ; lg ) onto the wall - what happens if it falls off ! after looking at mounts at target and best buy that were $100+ , would this possibly work ? fast forward
the mount took about <NUM> minutes to install ( too longer to locate the studs than mount it )
the tv is on the wall and works wonderfully
very solid mount and good articulation
my only comments are the cord clips included are very weak
i will be replacing them with black cable ties
also - they do need to have a second locking screw where you hang the tv on the articulating mount - i can wiggle my screen ( tilt ) by about 1/4&<HASHTAG> ; since there is only a screw on the bottom
overall , i liked the narrow wall mount and the 20&<HASHTAG> ; extension
definitely would recommend for a tv that is 47&<HASHTAG> ; .
easy to install , with extra hardware for installing your tv
however , my tv had a curved back , so i used the included spacers to space the bars on the back of the tv
i was skeptical of the two lag bolts attaching the bracket to the stud under the drywall , so i added two 5/16&<HASHTAG> ; lags , under washers holding the inside edges of the mounting brackets
after installing the swing arm wall mount , i grabbed the end of the bracket , fully extended
the bracket didn not sag a bit
i concluded that the supplied two lag bolts would have been sufficient
i have swung my tv out and exercised the various angles available , and found the swing arm not giving a millimeter
i fully recommend this wall mount
i have a few other videosecu mounting brackets for wall mounted and floor stand speakers and one for an sharp tv
all are quality products .
the fact that the pivot point on this tv mount was not built straight caused the tv to tilt slightly when it was swung out
there is no adjustment for it , so i had to make a choice for the tv to either be straight and level when it was pushed against the wall , or when it was out
i do not recommend this wall mount
to it is benefit though , it was reasonably sturdy and easy to install .
purchased for my sister to hang her tv on a wall and she and her boyfriend reported back to me that mount works great with the 42&<HASHTAG> ; vizio tv she got for christmas and was up securely in no time
i looked around in the retail stores and found that this mount was of similar quality at a much lower price
what can i say , it does what it is supposed to do , was easy to setup , and is of good value .
this was needed to mount a 32" lcd that weighs <NUM> lbs in my bedroom
i looked at another mount by the same company but it did not articulate so i was worried i wouldn not be able to achieve the viewing angles that i needed
so i found this one & went w/ it based on the high reviews
i could not be more pleased
1 ) price - if you were to go to the big electronics store ( bb ) or the big box monster ( wm ) you would pay hundreds
i can not fathom those more expensive mounts doing anything that this one does not
does it cook dinner for me ? why pay $100-$250 for a mount when you can get this one for $29
99 & oh , by the way have the confidence in <NUM> customer reviews averaging 4
5 stars at the time of this writing ? 2 ) function - this mount is solid
it articulates to the left , to the right
it pans , it tilts
one small negative
the plastic clips for routing wires are nearly useless
i took them off
3 ) whats in the box - normally i would not comment on what an item comes with but in this case i was so impressed i felt it was worth mentioning
it comes w/ everything you need in neatly sealed and labeled plastic sleeves
it comes w/ lag bolts that everyone will use to mount to the wall stud
( mounting to a wall stud is required unless you are mounting to concrete ) then it has <NUM> different screw sets to mount the plate to the back of your tv
it has <NUM> washer sets for the mounting plate ( based on if your tv has a flat or curved back )
then it has a spanner wrench for tightening the screw of the mounting plate
then it also has <NUM> plastic anchors for mounting to a concrete wall
last but not least are the vesa adaptors ( which i did not need ) 4 ) what you need that isn not included - pencil / level / stud finder / phillips screwdriver / drill w/ a 7/32 drill bit / socket wrench w/ a 13mm attachment
5 ) conclusion - this is a no brainer
i have another 32" that needs mounted
i think as soon as i click publish for this review i will be ordering another one
if you find yourself reading reviews on tv mounts and you have found this one your search is over , just click buy already .
this is mounted in a doorway between two rooms in my basement with a <NUM> inch tv attached to it
i can move it to either room and still keep the doorway open plenty wide enough to pass through
perfect for my needs .
sturdy and durable craftsmanship
bought for my grandma in mexico , had it installed and works great
has awesome mobility to enjoy your television from countless angles in your room .
if you want a wall mount that is universal and can be moved in all directions this is the one to get
my 42&<HASHTAG> ; samsung 3d tv mounted easily and the extensions were not required
i mounted it to a stud and it seems to be very secure
i am able to swing the tv to watch from my bed or from the lazyboy chair without a problem .
great wall mount at a great price
already fully assembled out of the box and seems built to last
i really like the swivel and tilt as we need it when laying down in the bedroom
easy instructions ( i am not a carpenter )
i used this on a 32" samsung led tv .
very simple set up and ease of installation
i followed the advice of another reviewer and removed the top of one of the center connections ( thus disconnecting the wall plate from the plate attached to the tv ) so that i could install the plate to the wall and the plate to the back of the tv as separate processes
both simple and quite easy
then it was simply a matter of slipping the two back together and the
i was able to install a 32" rca tv , without any help in less than <NUM> minutes
manufacturer provided a good assortment of screws and other hardware , as well as a hex wrench , a small open wrench and a level .
got this to hang a 32" sony lcd in my bedroom
used my stud finder to locate the studs , drilled <NUM> pilot holes and hung it up
and extra set of hands is helpful when hanging the mount and mounting the tv
holes on mount lined up perfectly with my tv
screws fit just right
no complaints .
used it for vizio 42&<HASHTAG> ; tv
easy to install
fit perfectly
what is there else to say ? strongly recommend for everyone .
i purchased this mount for my <NUM> inch lcd tv
installation was easy
the trouble i encountered was due to a bad wall stud finder
make sure you have one when you install this mount because you need to screw the mount into a wall stud or at least have one screw into a wall stud
the arm of the mount sags after i hooked up my 37in
lcd tv to the mount
my tv is within the weight limit of this mount ( less than 55lbs
) but the arm still sags due to the weight of the tv
i guess as long as it supports my tv , the sagging shouldn not be an issue
it just looks funny from the side
i do retract the arm inward towards the wall to minimize the sagging and it also gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that the arm will be less likely to break off
overall , for the price this mount is a great deal and works but i would suggest purchasing it for flat screen tvs less than <NUM> inches
i would not hesitate to buy this mount again but for a <NUM> inch tv at most .
i thought this was a great value for a wall mount
i have installed a <NUM> inch tv in my bathroom with this unit
it worked well with the visio tv that i bought
it looked it it could accomodate many other tvs because there were a variety of holes on the mounting bracket
is it the best quality ever , no
it is decent quality , and it worked well for me .
my tv ! couldn not ask for more
these reviews require too many words
i could have said what i meant in three .
this tv mount is easy to install
just follow the directions included
i installed this near the ceiling and i am using every bit of the <NUM> degree downward tilt
properly installed , the product is rock solid
i installed a 32" tv on it
i know it can hold much more
the articulating arms are easily adjustable and if you want to tighten it down and lock it in position you can do that , too .
this is the second videosecu product i have ordered
they are , and with the range of fasteners and extra hardware they include in the package , it is hard to imagine any speaker or tv that these systems won not fit .
for the price it can not be beat
the mount is strong and sturdy
two sets of hands are mandatory for mounting , three would be ideal
once up though , it is better than most of our friends mounts
it has full articulation , and i can swing the arm out and angle it towards my kitchen
this is highly important while cooking buffalo wings and trying to keep tabs on football games .
i originally bought this for a sony 40&<HASHTAG> ; tv , but installed it with a vizio 42&<HASHTAG> ; instead
i did this because the sony is an older model tv and weighs a little over 50lbs ( which is still within this mounts rating ) and the vizio only weights 23lbs
i have a sanus extended articulating mount that i bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it
( it now costs over $150 ) the sanus is much stouter in construction than this videosecu mount is , so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up , i swapped out tv is to match mounts accordingly
now that installation is complete , i am sure this mount would handle either tv just fine
is it the same quality as the sanus ? no , but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims
i saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install
now this is based on the <NUM> lb tv , but i am not experiencing this problem
the mount has <NUM> pivot points and after installation , all need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force
out of the box , this mount would have sagged like others complained , but i am guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process
i won not hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises
an excellent price ( $30 ) for a good quality mount
if you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install , buy the sanus ( and pay 5x more to do it )
if you want a mount that you can safely hang and secure your tv on , save some cash and buy this mount .
i am using this with a <NUM> inch samsung smart tv
the extended bars were not needed
this is very easy to mount to a wall stud with just two bolts
many bolts are provided to fit with your television
it is very sturdy and able to be positioned in many different ways
highly recommended .
this mount is heavy , strong and already in one piece
almost no directions were needed
the only issue i would have : after the mount is installed i had to lift the tv to the mount and screw the screws in while holding the tv up with one hand
i checked the instructions to make sure i wasn not being stupid
the directions confirmed to lift the tv and screw in the screws
other mounts have a bracket installed on the wall and tv , then i just lift the tv and click it right in
the sturdiness of the mount makes up for this defect in my opinion .
this mount is sturdy , easy to install , and easy to mount the tv to
the included hardware was heavy duty also
the action is good , and tension is adjustable
the tilt can be adjusted by using the knob in lieu of one of the bolts , or locked in place ( which makes it more difficult for someone to remove the tv unless they have a wrench with )
i mounted the 27" tv on our lanai , so a little is a good thing
the tv is now visible either on the lanai , or from the patio
i recently bought a second one , and they have changed
still sturdy , but lacking the quick mount feature ! now you must hold the tv in place while inserting the tiny screws through the back .
do not listen to other reviewers , screws that this came with are concrete only , there are no wood or dry wall screws
you will ! need a stud finder ! there are <NUM> holes in total on a mounting plate , so it is plenty enough if you hit the center of a stud
sturdy , good looking
there is a whole set of machine screws for ( my guess ) all tv types plus couple of tools that you will need .
i purchased this mount based on others comments beforehand and i appreciate the guidance
the problem with wall mounting flat screen tv is is to make sure the hole pattern of the mount lines up with the hole pattern on the tv you buy
i am using this mount with a vizio e320me and it works perfect .
i am using this to mount an older syncmaster 191t above my desk and was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy it is for the price
installation was simple , though i used the screws from the original monitor mount for the plate attachment , as none of those included would work with my monitor
the tilt mechanism requires loosening a bolt and then adjusting the monitor to the desired angle
i would have preferred another degrees of vertical tilting capability , but what is available will be fine for most applications
i posted a couple of photos that shows it mounted
overall i am very pleased with the purchase and would buy again should i need to mount another small display .
its sturdy , holds my tv really good , its adjustable & really really easy to install
an excellent product
i would definitely recommend it .
i got this for mounting a tv on the wall in my home office
price was good and it worked
the adjustments on it work well , and it has a gizmo to hold the cables in place
don not hesitate to buy
i think i am using this with a 38&<HASHTAG> ; tv .
it does the job and it wasn not too hard to install so i am a happy tv viewer
nothing bad to say about it
came with a bunch of bolt options for different make and model tv is
i have this wall mount installed outside
i have a 32&<HASHTAG> ; hanging on it in my backyard
easy to install and have had no problems what so ever .
we had to &<HASHTAG> ; shave&<HASHTAG> ; a little off the wall mount plate to get this product to work for us , but after doing so it has served it is purpose on our 24&<HASHTAG> ; tv .
this unit has worked perfectly in holding a 40&<HASHTAG> ; tv in an extended position for months - without sagging or failing
very happy with the purchase
unfortunately , i am returning this mount
though i like the look of it , particularly the two part plastic piece that clips to the wall mount portion to cover the bolts , i feel that the one i ordered wasn not well made
i purchased it to mount alg 26le5300 720p 60hz led lcd hdtvin our kitchen
the mount arrived quickly and was well packaged
unfortunately , the arm was welded to the wall bracket at a slight angle , meaning that regardless of how it would mount it and the lcd would never be level
also , the powder coating near one of the bolts had come off and i could see some rust already forming
i decided to see if the mount would be the right fit for the tv before returning , figuring i would just get a replacement and hope for the best
i am glad i did because this led me to find two other issues
the first one i blame on the manufacturers , the second i would consider a design flaw of the lg lcd
the first issue is that the screws supplied to attach the bracket to the tv are too few and two short
the screws are only 12mm long , and would barely catch in the threads of the tv if they weren not recessed at all
most mounting threads on lcds and plasmas are partially recessed
i stopped by my local lowes and picked up two packs of similar screws ( or something to that affect )
80 a packet so not much of an expenditure , just a big hassle
i needed 20mm long screws to mount this to the tv , so a pretty fair difference over what was supplied
the manufacturer supplies several different thread and gauge options , but only one shallow length of each set
the second issue is that this universal mount covered the power and hdmi ports on the back of the 26le5300
again , i think this is more of an issue with the tv then the mount , as they are situated rather high and central
either way , it is something you will want to check on your tv before ordering this product
i actually returned this and in its stead purchased a similar mount from the same company
thevideosecu swing lcd wall mount <NUM> inch extension <NUM> lb loading capacity for lcd tv monitor flat screen vesa 75mm/100 mm 1usgets very high marks from me
it is basically the same arm with a 75x75 to 100x100 vesa head on it
this second arm did not have any of the manufacturing errors of the previous model and fit the back of my tv perfectly
i understand that it is a very affordable mount , and that most of my issues may have been resolved with a replacement
however , i just can not give this mount any higher rating than i have .
i must admit , i am very cautious of what i buy especially when i have seen this identical bracket in the electronic stores priced three to four times than this one
bracket arrived much faster then what amazon estimated and was well packaged
the directions were adequate but i am very mechanically inclined so used them as a quick guide and had this bracket installed with my sony 37" lcd in under a half hour
my hats off to the marketing folks with this manufacturer as they did their homework and included additional hardware and brackets to meet any possible configuration out there
including mounting tools and level were also an exceptional idea
and tossing in a 7' hdmi cable was the icing on the cake .
if less money had been spent on packaging and more on quality , it might be a good product
the product was
the included level was broken
i would prefer to use my own level and have good hardware instead of junk on both counts
one of the pivots on the arm was so badly rusted out of the box it seemed to compromise the whole system
despite <NUM> huge lag screws and strong arms , the joints are not strong enough to keep the mount level as it extends and articulates
each time i moved it it had to be to be level
the hardware had to be tightened so much to keep it from wobbling , it made moving it very difficult
i used a 26" tv
the whole thing went back in the box for a refund .
i bought this mount for our bedroom in order to swing and tilt the tv based on our viewing angle
in order to move it i had to loosed the screws each and every time
i had it connected to a 27in vizio lcd which is pretty light
could not find a tension to keep it where we wanted it
had to return
worked great
easy mounting and setup
<NUM> vizio 42&<HASHTAG> ; lcd hung perfectly
it is a heavier tv , around 50lbs and it mounted up great .
received the product and got it installed today
for the most part i am pretty happy with the hardware except the materials being used to make screws or other parts
the screws get very easily damaged by the most commonly used screw drivers that you can find for $1 per piece
once i put the bolt into the lcd tv and mount it with the plate , i found myself having a hardtime removing the screw because the tread mark on the screw head is already messed by by the screw driver , which makes me doubt about the material being used on the mount and arms
is the material used on the mount going to deliver the same quality as the bolts and nuts ?
mounting a <NUM> inch lg tv weighing <NUM> poundsproless expensiveprevious purchase of videosecu productappeared solid and stronghad tilt and various adjustmentsmount on single studconsagging
this is amazing that it sags and does so at different angles based on how far the tv is pulled out from the walltherefore one cannot keep the tv properly aligned because any movement changes the tilt or other angles
mounting is a pain because the mounting bracket never comes apart from the articulation armcritical bolt attachment for the mount from the tv to the articulation arm does not get tight ! this is amazing
it is not stripped but it does will not stay tight even from the first use
this makes the product unsafe
i am amazingly frustrated bordering on angry because of the time put into this and now holes in the wall
i need to get a different one
my prior experience was with a videosecu mw380b tv wall articulating mount , which is far superior for a larger tv
i bought this other one because i wanted a tight fit to the wall
can i send a bill for my time and work putting it up and taking it down ?
the nook tablet , in both the 16gb version and <NUM> gb version , are the best color of 2012
both are bargains when purchased at the discounted price barnes & noble provides to its members
however , they are designed for reading
if you want a gaming tablet , a skype video tablet , or need access to thousands of apps , you need an
i have owned a "brand x" color for about a year , but seldom use it for reading because it causes eye strain
i have a nook simple touch that is wonderful for books , but its screen is black on white only , which does not work well for colorful magazines such as "automobile" or "national geographic"
barnes & noble has an offer that enables its members to buy the nook tablet for much less than the price quoted by internet vendors , so i took advantage of their offer
plus the staff of my neighborhood barnes & noble were very helpful , and invited me to classes they provide to teach new owners the in is and out is of their new tablet
mine is the 8gb version , which works as well as the 16gb version
i added a 32gb memory card , so my nook has more storage for books than i could ever fill
the nook tablet is the best of both worlds
it is easy on the eyes for long reading sessions because its screen was designed to prevent eye strain
the fonts are very clear , very sharp , and have very high contrast , enabling you to read with the screen set at a very low brightness level , eliminating eye strain
independent tests have verified that the nook tablet has less reflection and glare than any color or color tablet , because the screen is glass cover is bonded directly to the lcd , eliminated the air gap that causes glare
the vivid color makes magazines "pop" even more than their paper versions
barnes & noble adds a special "text only" option for magazine articles that make it easy to read the text by enlarging the fonts and putting the text of the article in a single long file
the nook "shop" does not work as well as the nook website on the internet for searching for specific books or categories of books
so , i downloaded the dolphin hd browser from the nook shop and use it to look at the nook shop is book inventory
the dolphin browser uses tabs , so i can put two or three books i am considering in their own tab , and switch back and forth
the nook tablet has pandora radio installed , so i can listen to my favorite music while i read books
the sound is weak through the nook tablet is puny speaker , but wonderful through good earbuds
i also transferred about fifty of my favorite cd is to the nook is memory card , so i can listen to music even when i am not near an internet connection
when i get tired of reading , the nook tablet lets me watch movies and tv shows on netflix or tv
movies on netflix look wonderful , because the color balance on the nook tablet is superior to that of any seven inch tablet currently available
skin tones are difficult to get "right" , but the nook tablet does a great job
many reviewers make the error of comparing the nook tablet to tablets , such as the apple
the nook tablet is designed to be an , and for that purpose , it is superior to any of its seven inch competition
the fact that it includes pandora radio and netflix is a bonus
but it is an
the nook shop has a relatively small number of apps , each of which has been tested to verify it works well with the nook tablet is seven inch screen
most android apps are designed for a three inch or four inch screen
the reading apps for children are impressive
last week i downloaded a free children is book that combined the best of the "book world" and the "video world"
the book played music in the background
as a character walked through a field , the flowers were swaying in the wind
the book provided an option to have a character read the book out loud , and an option to turn the voice off , so your child can read the book to herself
many of the children is reading apps are free , or cost less than $5 , a bargain compared with the $15 or $20 children is books sell for in stores
the nook website offers a "book of the day" for adults and a "book of the day" for children
the illustrations in the children is books take advantage of the nook is color screen
yesterday is children is book was "mary poppins" , a bargain for $2
but the real mary poppins seems a bit scary compared with the julie andrew is disney version
for people who want more than just the world is best , amazon
com sells a $35 sd card that converts the nook tablet into a conventional android tablet with full access to google play and its vast array of android apps
just put the n2a card into the nook is card slot , and restart the nook
when you want to use it as just an , take the n2a card back out
best of both worlds
the best seven inch color becomes a very good seven inch android tablet .
i saw this product on amazon and thought "what a great deal" because this is a 16gb version of the same tablet that barnes & noble is selling for $250 dollars
it mostly works , and the screen is great for reading books
i have had problems with the browser since <NUM> weeks of owning and the apps have issues loading and playing some games
if i could , i would return this product and just pay out the money for a brand new one .
now i have like four different kendels and i am such a fan
my darling daughter n law requested this
no way , says i
then i see these reconditioned ones with a warranty , cases n protective films , new chargers and <NUM> gb hd
had to get it or her
only cause she gave me the worlds best gran babies
and i guess i love her like mad too .
this is excellent tablet , excellent touch screen response and button controls
when you hold it in your hand , you will feel that its built tough and can withstand rough handling ( my 17m old tosses it sometimes out of excitement and its still holding good )
battery is also good , last about 8+ hours ; the old drawback is that there are very limited apps on noon web , but i heard there is a way to sideload adds from amazon that i haven not tried yet
but yes , i would highly recommend it .
i love nooks
kindle fire is ok , but nooks are easy to root and install cyanogen mod foe a full android experience .
have no idea why people love this thing so much , you can not load any applications unless they are from the barnes & noble store and you can not even download the free version of angry birds
apparently barnes & noble is worse than apple at remotely disabling nooks they deemed rooted by end users
you have less control of this thing than you would your tv
the root kits are useless for this os version 1
2 and the instructions to root / jailbreak it read worse than rocket instructions from annoying geeks ! it is an overpriced barnes & noble franchise in your dumb little hands and you are well served keeping your receipt and refunding it .
i bought this for my husband for his birthday after trying it out in bn and seeing how amazingly responsive it is
i did a lot of research and put a lot of thought into it , almost buying him a kindle fire because i thought it was more "manly" looking
after much consideration and comparison of hardware , i opted to get this one
the big selling point for me the fact that it can boot from the sd card
i have seen the n2a ( nook2android ) sd cards here on amazon and wanted him to have that functionality but didn not want to pay that much for one , so i did some googling and figured out how to make one myself
i purchased a 16gb micro sd card and in about an hour and a half , had the thing booting to cm7 from the sd card , and now it has full tablet functionality
it runs awesome , super smooth and very responsive , full tablet capabilities including running 3rd party apps and access to the google play store , and all without rooting or voiding the warranty
all he has to do to put it back to stock is remove the sd card ( which he never does ! it is pretty much useless in its stock form unless you only do light web browsing and read ebooks ) my husband loves it and couldn not be happier with it
he uses it every day
the only thing it doesn not have that i consider a negative is a camera
my tablet ( acer picasso ) has a camera and i do actually use it quite a bit , but my husband says he wouldn not use one on a tablet so it doesn not bother him anyway
he also dowloaded kingsoft office and now uses this for work as well
unbeatable hardware at an unbeatable price
and don not let the restrictive stock software stop you from buying it
just go around it !
when b&n ; designed this one , they were putting together a reading device that also happened to have some tablet features
as a result , what you get is pretty limited
it is a fairly sturdy device by feel , and not difficult to hold for a while and use
the quality of the screen is pretty good and it is not difficult to read for extended periods of time ( so long as you are not out in the sun anyway , almost all lcd screens perform poorly there )
very little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default , so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with that
you can sideload content from any source that uses adobe drm for epubs , and also epubs that don not have drm at all
this means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple
you can install an overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdrive
you can root it to get access to more apps
if you want to run a more pure version of android , you can go for either putting together a cyanogenmod card yourself or purchase one already made from nook2android
b&n ; gives away a book and an app every friday on their blog , so that is worth checking in on regularly
on the whole , this is an okay device for reading and can be a kind of nice to give to someone who normally tends to load their computers/tablets up with viruses by being carelessness
it is state works in your favor from that perspective
for more general tablet use , this is a pretty poor choice
also , as of the later devices ( nook hd/hd+ ) have been radically marked down , so if you are going to buy one of these you should look to get it pretty cheap
otherwise , it'd almost certainly make more sense to hold out for something more .
this is such a great tablet
one time didn not work
acted weird really weird
needed to be cleaned
now i keep eyeglass cleaning clothes ( disposable ) for it
has worked like a charm since
hooks up to the computer without the shelves going away
book reading is great too
i use it for an ereader with games that i sometimes play , but mostly as an ereader
recommended .
great product works just as described have had no problems with it since i got it thanks for a great product
i do not understand people , they are comparing this $100 tablet with $500 ipad , of course it is not gonna be the same
i would recommend this tablet to everyone especially for the kids .
months later , i am still happy with this tablet , but you should know <NUM> things
one is , you will get it for $224 if you are a b&n ; member
also , if you go online , often they have a deal such that if you buy a year is subscription to the ny times , they reduce the price of the tablet
to get the member is discount , you are better off going to a b&n ; store
but the big thing is , if you already own kindle books , barnes and noble stupidly don not provide a kindle app , however , you can buy the cheapest n2a card , either on amazon or on n2a
this allows you to boot your tablet up as a full android tablet ( like the $500 ones ) , and you can get the kindle app on that
there is no problem accessing your kindle books on the nook
since , as noted below , the nook ereader is beautifully designed , much better in my opinion than any kindle , so i use my n2a card only when i am reading a kindle book
i find b%n and amazon charge about the same for books
there are some books on nook that kindle doesn not have , and some on kindle that nook doesn not have
however , only nook has the page perfect editions and the enhanced editions of books with embedded video , audio clips , and animations
one other thing : the nook has a tab for "my stuff" so you can download music , pictures , videos and documents easily onto the nook
you don not have to buy music for it
use what is on your pc or what you rip from disk
i am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4 , 000 pictures
for that , i bought a <NUM> disk san drive for the nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a nook app
i don not know how you could do that on the <NUM> gig fire
i don not know if you can put pictures on the cloud for the fire
however , i can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the nook tablet without any cloud
i got this and the kindle fire on november 16 , 2012
then came days of comparing them side by side
you can see my review of the fire on its page is customer reviews , so , how about the nook ? first of all , if you want one , get it from barnes and noble
it cost $199 with a year is subscription to the ny times
even without that discount , it costs $249 with free shipping ( and , this month the nookcolor tablet is only $149 ! ) hands down , for the money there is no finer tablet than this nook
some reviewers say they are going to get a sony or a galaxy for their features
i have no quarrel with that , but you pay for those features
sony and galaxy are fine tablets--i have tried them out , too
however , the sony is on sale for $399
99 this month , and the <NUM> bit is on sale for $499
comparing it side by side with the nook , the sony salesperson said , "wow ! it is as good as the sony ! " yes , and for about the half the price
another salesman lamented that the sony doesn not have the netflix app , which comes with the nook
of course , sony wants you to buy their movies
barnes & noble just wants you to buy their books , which is fine for a bookaholic like me
b&n ; has 2 , 500 , 000 titles available , over 1 , 000 , 000 free
since they have a lot of earlier editions of books , book freaks like me can purchase those or get them free
they even have a page perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books
what you see on your screen is what a reader in <NUM> or <NUM> saw , brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books
you'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions , not $3
many children is classics are in this series , but also adult books , like butterflies
the nook also has enhanced editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text
some of the old books are also enhanced
changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined
you touch them , and can see what the original had
one of my nook books is a collection of kafka
you touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street kafka has mentioned , or of a notable person he is alluded to
in general , ebooks are superior to paper if they are on a tablet with access to the web
you read in more depth , and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience
the nook is connection to the web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks : look up and google ( or wikipedia )
the nook comes with pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the usb cord which comes with the nook
pictures , videos and documents can all be downloaded to the nook , which has folders for each , and , if the <NUM> gig iof the tablet is not enough for you , you can put a <NUM> gig or smaller sd card
that is not all ! if you are app happy , you can buy the n2a card for the nook tablet , which gives you every app in the android marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty
i myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the nook , with new ones being added each week
truthfully , if it is apps that are what you want most in a tablet , the way to go is the ipad--for $600-$700 at the least
i gave my granddaughter a nook tablet
many of her friends have ipads ; however , she says , she can get the same apps as her friends do
using the drawing app , she designed her birthday party invites on her nook and then emailed them also using her nook email
she says she prefers angry birds on the nook
i can not comment
angry birds don not tempt me , but i do play some games on my nook
the nooks have no cameras or face time , but with the money you save by buying the nook , you can get an iphone which does have both
if you want features like that in a tablet , it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees
no data fees with the nook , of course , although you can browse the web with ease and speed , depending on your router
you can stream movies and tv stories with ease on the nook
the picture quality is excellent if your wifi is
i am in a rural area with no 4g , but i still get crisp , clear movies with my wifi device
apps standard on the nook are hulu , smithsonian , showtime , and netflix
there may be more sources of flicks on it , but , truthfully , i haven not looked--and , since they add apps every week , you have to keep looking
if , like me , your primary use for a tablet is reading , the nook is tops
their ereader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive
it even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on
notice , it displays page numbers , not "locations" like the fire
if you can not remember who a character is , put your finger lightly on the name
<NUM> popups show instantly
touch find , and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on , complete with it sentence
( you can do this with place names as well
) the other choices are highlight , note , share , look up
the share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your contacts--not social networking sites
for those , you use the share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen
my friends tell me they love getting these passages from me
of course , i choose those that are witty or relevant to a discussion we have had
other reading options are go to page , back , find ( for when you want to type in the search screen ) , contents , text options , brightness and discover
this last shows you other books on the subject you are reading about or by the same author
in short , as an ereader , the nook is tops
as a tablet , it does well , although not as well as those that are way more expensive
actually , everything it does do , it does very well
it just doesn not have certain features--but that is true of every tablet i have seen except the ipad
as of now , the ipad is picture quality is not as good as the nook is or , for that matter , the fire is
the ipad3 will have hi def , however .
you would be crazy to buy here
its cheaper anywhere else
update i see amazon is now selling at the same price as the rest of the world so i retract
also discovered another negative
when browsing the web the nook works fine on all sites except amazon , now fancy that
it will stay on amazon about <NUM> seconds then pop back to where ever i was before web browsing
i have tried it over and over does it every time
thanks to all who commented about the ability to still root the nook
it is more complicated now but doable
i am debating about giving it a try
updated 1/22/12there are things to like about the nook , butno android marketb&n ; wants your credit card to download free apps - ain not gonna happenstuff that is free on android market cost money at the b&n ; app store
angry birds costs 2
99 but is free from android market
i bought this nook because it was
but no longer with the latest update b&n ; blocks attempt to root the device
boo hiss on b&n
; i never buy anything apple because of the closed system
i totally believe in open architecture for electronic devices
the closed system only benefits the seller not the user
if all you want is a reader , email and the web
then hey go for it
but i truly disappointed and may return it .
i bought this ebook ( 16g ) for my kindergarten and elementary children to read books on trips and my old child to check email
it does the jobs well until now
i personally like it very much for its excellent hardware performance
with low price , fast response , and light weight , book size , and barn and nobles support , it is the best device for children when you want to have something as an alternative for your computer
i am a fan of amazon
com and meant to buy a kindle for my children
but the displayed sample on my local bestbuy store showed me that the nook tablet responded much faster than kindle fire
it could not be generally true , but based on the displayed tablets , i had to choose the nook
until now , i have had mainly happy experiences with it
it has apps for children , one of them has many smithsonian videos that my small children love the most
my college age child also use it to check email at home because it responds in second to wake up , and we do not have to turn it off for many days before it runs slow
after you turn it off and restart it ( hold the power button for seconds for on and off ) , it become fast again
i just found last day it has a recipe app with more than 17 , 000 recipes
it has pictures for most of the products
my children have asked me to buy the istory app for 3
99 dollars , but it contends <NUM> or more story books for children that it reads to my children
wonderful ! the american history app is excellent too , it costs me <NUM> dollar or so ( not remember exactly now )
problems : it did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running
after the battery was charged for a whole night , it still refused to start
when i tried again in the afternoon , it started but took more than <NUM> minutes
i guess the software was damaged and repaired
it is now as good as it was before
i am still wondering what was wrong with it
it is not a computer and can not be connected to tv
only one or two of my children can use it in the same time
we still have to use computers when we want to enjoy movies or photos together
it was designed for you to buy their books
but i think the prices of most books are not low enough for me to purchase e version
i would rather buy some hard copies instead
however , one of my children loves the classical books which are free or only one dollar each
she is happy with the books
as a summary , the machine is excellent , sturdy , fast , and convenient for emails and web browsing
the books are not priced low enough for me to purchase although there are some old free books
apps for children are wonderful
my children love it .
i pulled the trigger on three of these on back in november
i'd cancelled my order for as many kindle fires because i felt the technical specs justified the extra $50 for the nook tablet
i also appreciated more onboard storage and expandability since we are a four person family and i drive
all three were for my wife and kids and not me , and i expected they'd be used on the road a lot
i think that by the time anyone reads this they should know that the tablets ( both kindle and nook , to be fair ) are tied to their respective distributors
that didn not come as any surprise to me , i fully expected it
i knew that , without modifying the device ( not really acceptable for your average person , if you ask me ) , i would be stuck with b&n ; is app store
what i didn not know was how woefully limited that app store really is ; it pales in comparison to amazon is and doesn not even register when compared to the android marketplace
my daughter got hers first ( a late birthday present )
for the most part , she was satisfied with it
i made sure wifi was available throughout the house ; we downloaded a couple of apps ( angry birds , of course , and a drawing program )
the first thing to notice is that the b&n ; app store has a tiny selection of free apps
the version of angry birds can not be found , but for a couple of bucks i didn not mind paying - i paid for the version for my phone , too
netflix works as well on the tablet as it does on any other device in my home ( ps3 and a bluray player , both hardwired networking ) as long as wifi connection is good
her other use was email , and since she hardly gets any , the built in app was ok
the other two tablets i purchased were for christmas for my wife and son , and that is where the problems started
my wife gets copious amounts of email from several different accounts and likes to keep it as neat as possible
she also uses her smartphone and computer and doesn not want to have to delete things three times
the built in email application absolutely sucks
you can not even empty the trash to completely delete messages you don not want
we experienced this on our phones and installed the highest rated email app we could find on the android marketplace , which also happened to be a free app
b&n ; makes nothing by distributing free apps in their marketplace , so this app was not available at all , and the selection was slim for other apps
even the touchpad app that people were using to syncronize with microsoft exchange servers apparently doesn not work ( and is very expensive for an app )
as i mentioned , i knew i'd be limited to b&n ; app store - i just didn not realize how limited that app store was
my wife then started getting a bunch of free samples of books , and bought several of them
they all downloaded except one stubborn one
that book would load just fine on all the other nooks in our house ( the other two tablets and we have two original nooks , as well )
i sent an email to technical support and received the usual "we got your request and will reply as soon as possible" message , along with the addition that they are experiencing a high volume of help requests
that was a week ago and we still have not heard back
after a few days , though , we physically took the nook to the store to get help
nothing worked ; off/on , archive/unarchive , even de and the device ( losing our wifi and email configs in the process )
this book still will not load
we finally "side loaded" the book , which required installing a program on my wife is pc ( which is very annoying in itself ) and we were required to create an adobe id ( how much spam will we get from them , i wonder ? )
after the book , it has no cover art
more annoyance
that book still won not download correctly , even after they told us it'd be fixed in <NUM> hours ( that was five days ago )
i am not one to "root" products like these ( especially since they aren not "mine , " as i won not be the one using them )
as the "guy , " it seems i am responsible for all technical support in the house and didn not want to deal with the ramifications ( or , frankly , even take the time to run through all those steps to do it )
it is not that i can not , it is that it is a pain in the buttocks and i simply shouldn not have to
we were not asking for the world , we were asking for a table that had nook software and allowed a few other niceties
i wasn not expecting an ipad for $250 , but i was expecting working software and a functional email program
it is technically not a bad tablet - the screen is bright and clear and responsive ; the ui is decent ( although i prefer the four buttons on my android phone over the single big "n" button on the nook )
it is solidly built and sturdy ; with angry birds and netflix as my only benchmarks i can say they both run much better than they do on my phone , with no pauses ( that i saw ) in angry birds at all
however , the accumulation of annoyances was a bit too much for me ( let is say there was a nagging voice coming from somewhere
the other side of the bed )
i am returning all three - luckily b&n ; has a holiday policy that will allow me to return them , which is very cool of them
they have not lost me as a customer ; i have my books purchased from them and will continue to buy
i hope them the best in the future ; it was a nice try
if they just weren not so tight fisted about control over content ( especially apps , in this case ) i'd have stuck with it
technically speaking , the device is quite good and , at the current time , imo , the hardware is worth the price tag
i wouldn not mind being limited to the b&n ; app store if they actually offered more apps
a lot more , as they have practically nothing compared to what is available for the android community at large
again , i am not asking for an ipad ; i know the ipad can do some really cools things this tablet can not , just something to make the "tablet" part of the nook tablet more worthwhile
i imagine they will fix glitches with the download problem , too
i am not the only person who had a problem , but i think everyone else managed to find a solution ( besides )
keep in mind i generally know what i am doing and tried everything , and the "expert" at the store couldn not fix it , either
the lady from glee didn not come out and entertain us while they fixed our tablet , either
that was disappointing
so that is my review - it is decent hardware hamstrung by a few bugs and tight fisted control over content
some will argue that it is not meant to be a tablet , it is meant to be an , but let is be honest - it is marketed as a tablet ; it is called the nook tablet
it doesn not have to be an ipad , but it should work a lot better than it does at being a tablet .
i went to a few places just to try testing them out , best place to test them out first hand was bn
the people at walmart didn not want you near them , and didn not know anything about them
best buy was pretty much the same , except you could isorta' test them out
bn though had people trained to know everything about them , even the stuff that was not listed about them on the bn website
first thing not listed : if the nook colour can do it , so can the nook tablet
( for instance
cbz files without installing any extra apps ) the 16gb model was much more responsive than the 8gb , so to me it was well worth the extra <NUM> bucks
add to that that currently if you buy one at bn and don not like it , you have <NUM> weeks to return it for a full refund as long as it is still in new condition ( so no attempting to root the device , which from what the rep told me will brick it unlike the colour ) that pretty much sold me , i found a place with micro sd cards on sale , bought a few , and took my nook home
pros : the screen is awesome ! i use it for reading
cbz comics and
pdf files more than anything
the missing gap between the glass and screen made reading much better
also the response on the touch screen was great
much better response time at turning pages , launching apps and using the inet that other tablets in the budget rangenative flash supportnative
cbz support ( main reason i bought it ) supports almost every popular ebook format except for
mobi ( which can be converted to epub or
pdf anyway ) good size for holding one handed for reading and lightweight ( under a pound ) battery life
<NUM> hours+ with wifi off , 8+ with it on , i tried it out and watched lots of movies and did some reading on it without it coming close to dying on me
a test drive opportunity if you buy it at bn and dont scratch it up or anything
i like the idea that i was able to take it home and so if it actually does everything that i want it to do wihtout a fear that i am stuck with it for good
also if you buy it from bn you can buy an 'oops' return warranty ( which means if you spill coffee on it or drop it , it can be replaced ) affordable if you go without things like eating out 2x a week for awhilecons : lack of android market , lack of some apps i would like to see on the bn market ( such as google music app ) no sideloading apps at the moment either
that being said , this also means that apps available from bn will actually work with your nook , there isnt a quantity over quality in the app store either
this means that if you have bought an app from android market , you will have to buy it again if you want to use it on the nook
the screen
trust me , i love it
but unlike other tablets where if you crack the glass you just have to replace the glass , on the nook if you crack it , the screen is toastno front facing camera ( or any camera for that matter )
the ability to use skype would have been nice , but wasn not a complete necessity
i have had many friends with tablets that had a camera that swear they never used it even once , and thinking about it , i wuld seldom use it either since most places outsite of my house that i will use it are places where video chatting would be frowned on , like starbucks or the libraryno bluetooth , which to me didn not matter , but it seems to be an issue for some people
there is bluetooth , but it is disabled and there isn not a way to enable itno gps , this would be nice , unlike bluetooth , i would actually use it
mono speaker instead of stereo , again seems to be an issue for other people , i plug it into the minijack on my surround sound at home or the jack in my car stereo when i am on the road though and its just fine
i use headphones if i am out and about
why on earth would i care about speakers that i never use anyway ? no
flac support
a good chunk of my digital music now is
it does have
ogg support thoughno
avi support
again , a massive portion of my movies etc are all in
avi format
it does have
mkv and
mp4 support though , so from here on out i will just have to rip my video files in those formats if i plan on watching them on it
lack of decent accessories selection
lets face it , the case market seems to be geared toward people that worship at the church of steve , and the availability of accessories shows it .
and what is it ? why it is an outdated b&n ; tablet ! a friend of mine purchased this after seeing my 9in hd+ tablet , but wanted the smaller 7in version
it works fine for what it is , but it caused her much confusion as it did not seem "as nice" to her as my 9in concerning screen quality
and that is because this is not the new nook hd with a 1440x900 screen resolution and upgraded hardware , firmware , and software which has been on sale everywhere since the b&n ; father is day sale was extended indefinitely
this is the old nook color with a standard 1024x768 resolution screen and minus the upgraded hardware and os
iow this is the old model : ) so if looking for that "new , on sale" tablet by b&n ; like my friend was , well , this ain not it
she will be returning hers and getting what she wanted initially
as for this one it looks fine and works fine for what it was , but comes up short these days , period .
the nook tablet is great
i have used it to check , browse and look at books , and also transferred one from my p
i like the way it will sync with the direction its rotated , and i love the touch screen
thanks amazon !
check your sn with barnes & noble is <NUM> number
mine was used from buyaccessories
i paid $70 too much as used is under $30 these days .
i read all the reviews and decided to buy this barnes and noble nook for my grandson for christmas it was used but with original box and accesories through ez corps ! and i am happy to say this barnes and noble is the best i ever invested in the picture and color is beautiful
let is put it this way my niece that has the kindle was checking out the barnes and noble nook and compared it to her kindle said that the barnes and noble nook has a clear picture than her kindle and more apps ! and i told her i did my homework and looked this nook up and it had the best reputation as far as for a kid , young teen , best nook ever invested in money and used at that but i will only order used if the item says like new with original box with accesories
and i will only order anything used through ez corps ! best company to ever order anything from on amazon fast professional customer service and love there shipping and handling ! and there all there used products are tested before selling which is a plus
i would highly recommend this company any day to any one , friends , family , etc , yes this barnes & noble nook is well worth ordering used or new
thank you kristen cates .
i could not be more pleased with - or impressed by - the nook tablet ! i know that amazon is "enemy territory" , but the nt does a much better job of meeting my needs than would a kindle fire
not only can i use my netflix account but i also have full access to the amazon prime website to watch films and videos ! the screen is incredible - bright and colorful and very fast due to both the fast processor and the full gig of ram
i a 16g micro sdhc card and have more than enough room for my entire library of sideloaded epubs , pdfs , mp3s , and mp4 videos
and , of course , the primary use : it is now much easier to read in bed at night
the backlit screen means no more glare from an external reading light .
i have tried the ipad , the kindle , and the sony , and nothing has worked better than this nook tablet
it is light , the screen resolution is amazing for movies , and the applications i use work beautifully
even the speakers are excellent for what they are
no complaints at all .
nice specs with nice screen
not worth the price with just the stock operating system , might as well save the bucks and buy the cheaper color model
you cannot use the larger 16gb internal memory to load your own files as the bad boys at b&n ; restricts your access to only 1gb of that memory
update : because of the unhappy owners b&n ; will relax this restriction when you take the unit into their store and reserved space will be changed so you get 8gb free space
as is , the unit is severely crippled from making full use of its outstanding specs
turn this baby into a great android tablet by "rooting" it - easily and painlessly done by buying one of those sd card based kits
i got a <NUM> gb card with the root kit and i now have full access to android apps with the ability to revert back to stock is if desired
you can now get all these capabilities on a really good performing tablet for well under $130 ( like new used ) but remember you get a unit that is a generation old and doesn not have bluetooth , gps , and hdmi out like most other newer tablets have .
if all you want is a tablet for reading b&n ; books and periodicals and maybe playing the occasional cheesy game , this is for you
otherwise , pass
this is listed as an android tablet but it is not
it is android on the surface but it can not access google play and instead uses the b&n ; app store
this means paying for apps that are free elsewhere
also , my unit takes an incredibly slow <NUM> minutes to boot , drops wireless signals that are strong and includes a browser that has the speed of a 90s drug store computer
wonder where the camera is ? it is at the factory -- there isn not one
forget skype or face to face video chatting
spend your $200 on a real tablet
by the way , not a slap at amazon , just the tablet itself .
this thing has been through so much
closed in doors , thrown across the room , been the object of desire in a toddler tug of war and it still keep working
it i just fantastic ! to any one complaining that he app store for barns and noble is too small i say just sideload google play with the root kit
it is easy and doecker skills to do .
i am happy , satisfied and proud of myself by selecting such a wonderful tablet like my nook
honestly it worths more than a five star rating
i will recall a phrase in a movie , it came to a certain point when i had to decide between style and substance
that is right ! i got both on this tablet
the product arrived two weeks ago , i did charge the battery and afterwards registreded the product so i immediately starting getting books , nowadays i have plenty of nook books to read ahead
my and friends love the aesthetics of the nook look , as i love all the features in the device
pros : all of them
- the screen is so clear ( "wows ! " me all the time ) , fast response to tasks , easy menu , fast processor , micro sd card slot added 32gb extra fun ( big smile ) , lightweight , long life battery
cons : none
the nook tablet is a solid hybrid tablet/ebook reader
it excels at ebook reading , and has many functions as a tablet as well
this is a minor upgrade for nook color owners , but a major upgrade for those going from the nook or kindle eink display reader
pros : 7" vividview ips touchscreen , bonded for glare reduction
this is the best ips screen on the market in this class of device
microsd card slot , for up to 32gb of extra storage
microphone for voice recording , particularly usefull to "read" books to your children without having to physically be there
reliable wifi card
1 gb built in ram for smooth , fast video
netflix and hulu
ereader bests the competitions
easy to root , if that is something you would do
cons : it is $50 more than some low end hybrids
much like the other low end tablet is , it runs on android , which is not the best tablet experience
limited apps , although the list expands almost daily
overall , this is a great device and although it is $50 more than some of the competitors models , it is also a far more refined product which doesn not have many of the problems of the others
highly recommended !
the nook color is a great tablet
it sometimes is very slow but it is still a good tablet
i have dropped it a few times and it is still okay .
for the price this is a great tablet
it lacks a camera , gps , and bluetooth , but that still leaves a lot , between web browsing and running lots of android apps
barnes and noble did cripple these with limited software through their store but i did get around that by rooting mine
that said , i was sort of surprised to see this pop up as something recommended by amazon today
the newer version is faster , has a higher resolution screen , is lighter despite same screen size , and has bluetooth
( still no camera or gps )
b&n ; also is now allowing access to the google play store
it is available on the newer version but i don not know if they updated the software for this one to allow access
i suspect they didn not but this would be something to check on if considering purchasing
if you want a tablet for web browsing , checking email , ebooks , video , and many other apps and this is as much as you want to spend , then it isn not a bad deal
i would recommend paying more for the newer version--the nook hd
( they also make a version with a larger screen , the hd+ ) also note that there are third party programs available which will allow you to boot a rooted android system off of an sd card
this will give more options but i found the original nook tablet to be sluggish running off such a card--possibly because i also went to jelly bean and this might have been too much for the older tablet
i wound up going back to running the rooted software directly off the tablet ( but rooting is more work than inserting a card )
the hd works well off a rooted jelly bean card .
i have used several different <NUM> inch tablets
the best i used was the galaxy tab 7
0 plus
this is a less expensive tablet and very , very good
but rooting the nook tablet made it great
that is a fairly easy thing to do with a bit of patience and reading
there are videos on how to do this and links to necessary files
all you need to get you started is google "root nook tablet"
yes , when it is rooted it does void the nook tablet warranty , but it can be unrooted without problems
the screen is beautiful , it is fast and with the micro sd card slot , has plenty of room for storage
i bought my 16gb for $229
a great tablet for the price and i use it every day
great purchase
the galaxy tabs are noted for audio quality and , of course , have some features that can be useful
but the nook tablet is mighty fine and a great investment for the price .
the customer support people at barnes & noble site are clueless
they are useless for providing help
if you buy tablet , you are on your own
in the store it is the same .
if you want an , get an - the battery dies in a few hours ( or a couple , depending on brightness settings )
if you want a tablet , get a tablet
there are far better options for a similar price
if all you want to do is read magazines and buy a few apps , fine
but this thing is truly lacking
i have owned mine for <NUM> months , and haven not changed my mind about it yet
update : the product gets even worse with age
it will not fully charge , ever , and at <PERCENT> it goes crazy
it runs all sorts of apps , closes them , types things into the browser , and won not let you use the tablet at all
this may not seem like a big deal , but it is unacceptable
<PERCENT> should still be enough to read for a bit , rather than going psycho and taking over the device .
just picked up a refurbished nook tablet from newegg is website and its amazing
only has a <NUM> x <NUM> pixel screen but from a foot away you can not tell the different between this and a device with <NUM> x <NUM> pixels or more
reading is a pleasure
i have had all the kindles and all the nooks and for the best overall reading experience the nook is better
why ? the nook devices feel great to hold
the plastics are soft , all the buttons are in good places , and recharging takes no time at all
also , the software layout and navigation is easy and logical
next , the font choices , sizes , and other personalizations are all useful
and finally , no freaking ads
you can personalize your home screen and on the nook touch you can select your own photos for the screen saver
what is my problem then with kindle ? couple things
the ads of course
also , i personally don not care for the software
you are stuck in their software with no way to personalize it
boring ! also , the buttons are in bad places so you can accidentally shut the device off
on the lower priced kindles the font choices are fewer and the smaller size choices are useless unless you use a magnifying glass
and the devices aren not as nice to hold
at least on the fires they took the idea from nook on making the backs have a soft plastic
i am pretty sure that anyone who takes the time to try both nook and kindle will like the nook better
as reading devices go they just make more sense
as far as a full fledged tablet goes you will have to look to apple or samsung in my opinion
matter of fact i am writing this review on my ipad and shortly i will go back to reading on my nook tablet .
i love using this
it is light and easy and fast ! love that is has hte capability of google play on it ! so hard to find things that are compatible
my wife was tired of dragging books around she loves the covienence of the tablet and can make the text larger
i was looking at expensive tablets that were more like mini notebook computers
i already have a high end notebook
i wanted something that was very portable and not combersome to take on trips , go to coffee shops and etc
i wanted the ability to get email , do limited surfing and read books
the nook works flawlessly and the display is really nice
i have an n protocol router and the nook is quick on the net
i read some negative reviews here
they appear to be written by folks who want to take a $200 unit and turn it into a $500 unit with various apps and other applications
here is a news flash for the naysayers
go out and buy the $500 unit and quit complaining
if you want to read books , surf and get email , you will like this unit .
update : put on cm 10
2 ( android 4
2 ) last week
i have got to say , it is nice
fonts are small , though one could choose dpi if they had visual issues ( google this )
netflix works , and the ui is really quite nice - pretty much no need for button savior , battery life is same as cm7
in general i like it better than cm7
my major hardware dislikes are headphone jack requires a little wiggling sometimes , no bt , no gps
seems to charge fine with a normal cable
at this point i lean toward samsung tablets - i like the ir and the microsd slot
===========================update jul 2012 : i have installed cyanogen 7 , which works with button savior
i had trouble installing from
zip booting into recovery but was able to install without a hitch using a bootable microsd card
fonts are sometimes a bit big , as is line spacing , but in general , cm7 frees you of the b&n ; , even as somewhat mitigated below
netflix doesn not work , and google chrome won not run on android 2
headphone jack a bit intermittent - need to wiggle wire sometimes
===========================original review , dec
===========================first i give a summary , followed by the details if u are interested
i hope people will read reviews here , as , if you say much at all on b&n ; is site , they don not post your review and don not allow you to modify it so that u can post it ! : a nook tablet could be quite good if you only want to : - read ebooks purchased from b&n ; - browse the web on a tablet- play a small selection of games , having to pay normal android/apple pricesget something else or modify it if u want to : - buy a full selection of games/apps- pay the same price for a game as u would on an iphone/ipad , android phone buying from either the android marketplace or amazon app store
- play music where u can sort by artist , album , genre , etc
- play mpeg videos- watch youtubeif u are willing to do a bit of work , you can do all this by modifying the device
i used it rooted with the modifications described below for <NUM> months , before installing cyanogen 7
2 on it
this is a huge improvement over rooted with the below modifications - it is essentially a normal 7" android tablet now
the details : ============my daughter got a nook tablet for christmas 2011
she'd been saving for an ipad ( ~$500 ) but at the rate she was saving , we took pity after a year and a half
while she does read ( and so do us parents ) , she also wanted to use it as a music player , and a movie watching device while away from wireless in the car , on a plane , etc , and she wanted to play some games
i did my reading and we seriously considered an ipad for the family with each of our <NUM> kids putting in $150 or so
i read about the kindle fire and nook tablet - the fire only had 8gb of onboard storage at the time , and no micro sd slot
this was pre samsung galaxytab , nexus , etc
since the nook tablet has 16gb and a micro sd slot , we went to a store to take a look
sales guy was good , and the device hardware shows well
once we got it home and were doing more reading about setup , we found the first of our issues : issue <HASHTAG> : onboard memory========================of the 16gb of storage , you can only place your own items in 1gb
the rest is for b& ; content
1gb is not enough for a music collection , or any significant amount of video
a 32gb class <NUM> card was also in her stocking , having read about this ahead of time
once she unwrapped it and we set it up ( easy enough ) , annoyance <HASHTAG> showed itself : issue <HASHTAG> : app prices and quantity=================================2 examples : angry birds and fruit ninja
- bn market : $2
99 , $3
- amazon is android market : $0
99 ( ) , with free versions available- android market , $0
99 for either , plus free , versions available
- apple app store , $0
99 and $0
99 , plus free , versions available
youtube : free/ on all android/apple phones/tablets i know of , not available on the nook tablet , not in the nook store
i didn not buy either game , but instead looked back to some of my reading - u can load amazon is appstore without rooting the device , esp
if it is running v1
0 of the software
i got that working and bought $0
99 fruit ninja and angry birds
while i was at it , i a few other apps by them to myself and to get them , and got usb drivers working on an xp laptop so i could sideload via adb over usb
i wasn not home for christmas , but i did have my work laptop which has music on it
i copied some over and began to use the music player
issue <HASHTAG> : music player limitations===========================================the music player in android is decent - has been since android 1
5 - the first version i used
u can , generally , sort by artist , album , etc , and the ui has dark backgrounds rather than white
the nook music player doesn not allow sort
for this , i didn not want to buy a music player , so i went ahead and rooted the device and installed honeycomb is ( android 3
0 is ) music player , which is free
also put the standard android youtube app on since i could now access the android market
the problem wasn not quite solved , because changes to the sd card ( adding files ) weren not recognized
i tried winamp , songbird and android 4
0 is music player when ics came out
they had the same issue
ttpod does work - you can manually refresh at any time
i now run cyanogen , whose music player ( modified stock android to add gesture support ) works just fine
they were aware of tablets when they wrote it
this is ironic - b&n ; had to do actual work to make it much worse than using the normal android version , plus they had nice opportunities to improve on the experience of a phone due to the large screen - cyanogen <NUM> android supports gestures for music - do an arrow to the left like "&lt ; " , say , and it will go back a track
this would be great while driving
( note that u can unroot by putting a copy of 1
0 on an sd card which , though i am not sure , would probably allow you to return the device if u needed to )
issue <HASHTAG> : video player limitations===========================================i'd also brought on my work laptop half a dozen videos i nabbed from our tivos from which i stripped the commercials , saving them as mpg videos
these wouldn not play with the player
i solved this with mx player , free version , which plays them fine
u can do this only if u have installed amazon is app store or rooted and can access the android market
people out there are selling pc software to convert videos to a format nook tablet can use
no need - just get another video player
mx player tip : brightness control is an up/down swipe on the left hand side of the screen , volume on the right
issue <HASHTAG> : ui inflexibility==========================u can not add shortcuts to the desktop , and can not do much with the sliding bar either
for this , i installed app manager ( tough to find a
apk to sideload using adb , so i needed rooting and then got it from android market )
this is a fantastic app and i don not use my golauncher screen much any more
also , there is one physical button
standard android buttons such as menu ( ) and back aren not always around in the ui , and holding home doesn not bring up a list of open applications as it does in carrier or stock android
they should have put those standard <NUM> buttons on the device
update after a month rooted : use button savior , which gives soft buttons with a flyout
once in a while , you have to use nt hidden settings to check usb debugging unless you use cyanogen
update post cyanogen : cm7 can have soft buttons ( back , menu , home , etc ) displayed all the time , if desired , and has button savior installed as well
issue <HASHTAG> : can only charge with their charger/cable==================================================nothing more to say
blackberries and android phones in the house all can charge in the car or at all the computers by just connecting a cable
it charge very slowly , even if it doesn not tell you it is , when connected to a pc because or other charger
with some irony , b&n ; has had to mail me both a charger and a cable this year due to breakage
if they could charge with any cable , they wouldn not have to
update : with cyanogen , it charges with any cable , though slowly unless it is the actual nook stuff - there must be something in hardware
issue <HASHTAG> : ota update breaks all the niceness i have achieved==========================================================an ota update , v1
1 , will break the ability to mail yourself
apks to be used to enable apps to install and to enable debugging
i imagine u could have done these steps while on 1
0 and gotten sideloading via pc/adb to work , but u can not disable ota updates
u can if you root , though , so i did , then used sqlite to modify a setting to only update when done manually
it will never
update : irrelevant now
goodness <HASHTAG> : hardware is pretty sweet=====================================snappy , installs apps fine , opens them quickly , videos are fairly smooth , scrolling is pretty good ( but not as nice as apple is )
screen is great from angles , clear and bright
it is lightweight and can be held easily in one hand
speaker is pretty loud - louder than any of our phones except maybe blackberry
goodness <HASHTAG> : the reading aspect===============================the reading end of the device is , though i give amazon is original kindle and all subsequent ones and advantage - an order of a book on an original kindle appeared on the device in less time than it took me to back out of the purchase ui
doing so from the web is also very fast
a web order using a computer of a b&n ; sample appeared about an hour later , but quite snappily when done from the device
goodness <HASHTAG> : books with videos/sound====================================yes , these are available on kindle fire and ipads
i know
i do like the talking kid is books ( reminds me of a leapfrog tag pen , but without the ability to touch words and hear them ) , and the free cookbook sample had a video of making a chocolate sauce
this is good for cooking ! u can see what each stage is supposed to look like
goodness <HASHTAG> : good if u root it , for $250========================================when rooted , it is a nice tablet + it has the b&n ; connection , and it cost $250
it isn not an ipad ( no cameras or bt ) , and it is half the price
update nov 2012 : there are now a multitude of 7" tablets ( asus , samsung , google ) which get my recommendation .
i own the original nook reader and the nook tablet
i have been happy with both
when i read all the wonderful reviews about the nook hd+ i couldn not wait to buy one
the main reason that i bought the reader is that my vision has deteriorated over the years to where i need at least <NUM> point type
the availability of different sized type on the reader devices is very welcome
i use the tablet , not only for reading , but to watch netflix movies while on my exercise bike
the nook tablet works okay for that , but the larger display of the hd+ seemed that it would be an improvement
however , there are several problems with the current edition : there needed to be at least one more font size at the
i had to choose between too small and too large
the sound level was too low , even with headphones
i could not find a barnes and noble application to provide better control over the volume
there are a number of applications which used to work on the nook tablet that are now locked out by the current os version
so , in spite of the beautiful display , i reluctantly returned the hd+ to my local store
when planning future upgrades
i would advise barnes & noble to consider the needs of older customers and people with disabilities
we are not an insignificant market segment .
rooted , and cyanogenmod installed , works awesome
the nook tablet has a bit more memory than the original nook color , so that is why i got this one .
the b&n nook is a great device
the hardware in it makes sure there is no lag or waits while watching videos , reading books , or surfing the web
the builtin apps are great , as well as the overall layout and options
the major drawback is the inability to load 3rd party apps
but roll back to firmware 1
0 and load all you want before upgrading
or root it ( although amazon instant video will not work after rooting ) .
it accepts up to 32gb micro sd cards but does not work properly with a 32gb card
mine would not boot because the card used too much energy
that was the only issue i had
customer service told me to unplug the card before booting up and then insert the card
i returned it and purchased a samsung galaxy tab 7
0 plus
funny thing is barnes and noble rrjected my review .
let is just say this will never be ipad or anywhere close to it
that said , it is never meant to compete with ipad anyway ! if you compare this with amazon is fire , it is a closer comparison
frankly , this is better than fire
hands down , nt has better hardware specs and it shows when you start browsing internet with heavy imagery or picture ebooks or emags
the complaints about nt is os restriction is very true
so is amazon is fire ! it is not the end of the world , just root the device and you have in hand a functional tablet for $250 that is rather spiffy
this doesn not get a rate because form factor is the biggest drawback compare to the os lockdown
personally , tablets is too small for serious computing usage
it is a good reading form factor though
i can not give this a rate because b&n ; is app store is too small
even when rooted , google is market place is filled with apps .
i got a 16gb microsd off of amazon for under $14
00 and it holds just little over 8k books , it was what swayed be over the kindle fire , that and the 1gb of ram vs 512mb
now that they released a 8gb nook for $199
00 its price point is on par with the fire , and has the option of expansion , and a simple hack allows for a custom android launcher , and i can easily install the amazon app store ( and kindle app ) , android market place , and have a very decent wifi tablet , tbh i wasn not much of a analog book reader , but with this little nook tablet i have been averaging a book a week , along with
99 monthly magazine subscriptions
when the original nook first came out i purchased one and took it back 2hrs later , it was less then what i expected , but i think barnes and noble has come a long way and now this version is very impressive
battery life is decent , depending on your screen brightness preference and netflix usage , unless i am at home , i usually have the screen brightness at little less then half , and wifi off , and get about of nonstop read time , <NUM> days of casual reading/standby .
great product , great sale , i love this product , and my children will too i cant wait til christmas to give them their present .
the nook hd was designed to be a book reader , although it also is a great way to watch videos on netflix , or listen to pandora radio , or to your favorite music
i added a 32gb memory card so that i can have thousands of my favorite songs with me when i travel
the nook hd has a screen with the best resolution and the least glare and reflection of any color
it is the only color that comes close to the reading experience of an reader
barnes & noble has lots of children is books that take advantage of the nook is color and audio features
i bought a christmas story that can read out loud in english or spanish , and on each page something would be moving
snow falling , or the moon moving across the sky
the nook is very light , which makes it easy to read for hours , and you don not mind having your nook with you 24/7 in your purse or "man purse" ( i use a small laptop bag )
the barnes & noble selection of is huge , and includes <PERCENT> of best sellers
each day , there is a "book of the day" for $2 or $3
many of them or classic books .
i have owned an ipad 2 , an original kindle fire , and first generation 3g dual screen nook
i decided it was time to upgrade my original nook and went with this tablet
i purchased mine direct from b&n
this is a fantastic ereader with a few tablet functions
i really like the interface on this ereader more so than the kindle fire
don not get me wrong , the kindle fire is a very nice device , but i like the personal touch i can give the nook hd
it is more customizable
i can create my own wallpaper and customize my home screen
the ereader is very light and easy to hold with a contoured , grippy back
the screen resolution is fantastic ! even small print is readable
the colors in magazines is exceptional and the scrapbook feature is an innovative touch
i really appreciate having a physical home button , and external volume rockers & power button
the interface is very user friendly and aesthetically pleasing
setting up email was a snap and customizing my security settings from lock screen passwords to shopping passwords is much appreciated
web browsing is very zippy on this device
more zippy than the kindle fire
ereading is also a pleasure , with customizable fonts & backgrounds
i was surprised at how well i was able to read on it outside in the shade
it still has a lot of glare , but it is much more readable than the ipad or the kindle fire
i can not see the ipad or kindle fire screen at all outside with all the glare
nook hd is not as readable as an eink screen , so i will be keeping my original nook of <NUM> years for outdoor reading
but for a tablet ereader , i was really surprised at how well it did outside in the shade
i have since given my husband the ipad 2 , as i like the 7" form factor of the ereader/tablet devices
i take them with me everywhere
if you were to ask me which i liked better , the kindle fire or the nook hd
i wouldn not be able to choose
amazon has a larger store for books , apps , movies etc
but i like b&n is nook hd for it is interface , superb screen and customizable home screen
it also has expandable memory , and you can sideload epub books
i also like the look of the nook hd better
it would come down to personal preference and which store you have the most investment with
all in all , the nook hd is a great device that hasn not gotten the attention it deserves , and is worth serious consideration .
i got this for my little girl , as she filled up her 8gb tablet with games
we just love the nook hd tablets
the fact they have google play , and you can change the background to a nice picture , makes these tablets superior in most ways , to the kindle fire
yes , the fires have their own advantages ( we have some ) but overall , we prefer the nook hds .
i tried kindle hd , samsung tab 2 , and nexus 7
i returned them all since i had high standard for display quality of tablets
i was very disappointed by their color faithfulness and/or resolution
one day i saw a hot discussion online about discounted nook hd from staples
i rushed to a local store and played nook hd
its screen immediately attracted me : bright , white , colorful , high resolution
this is what i want ! i have being enjoying nook hd ever since
it has the best screen period ! online community like xda forum has ways to root nook hd and install android by yourself
i rooted mine and can enjoy all apps from google play store
even today , i still wow when i read text , view photo , and watch videos on nook hd .
not so happy with it
i have had my nook hd for approximately <NUM> months
during that time , i have ordered <NUM> books , of which i have read 50
those read were placed in created shelf a or shelf c , depending on whether i liked it or not
everything was working fine until they did a recent update and then it was like a tornado was let in
locked up my nook until i downloaded the update and then found all my shelves gone and books missing from my library
called gone and will have to create again plus move read books back into and missing books from library have to be downloaded again
one book was not found and after an hour on the phone , bn said the publisher stopped making it available for the nook ( is available for the kindle ) and will issue a refund
fortunately i kept the email confirmations of all books i ordered so i could give them the order number
customer service is lacking at bn
i had to make multiple calls until i was finally put in touch with someone who could solve the problem of the missing book
one other seems to have changed screen brightness as before i could read it out by the pool and now i no longer can
in fairness , i will also mention that i have a kindle paperwhite and an update wiped out my created collections , but didn not lose any books and can still read it out by the pool
both have and that may be an inherent problem with updating through it as far as shelves/collections go .
the nook hd is my third nook device
i like the nook simple touch , nook tablet because i primarily use it to read books , watch an occasional video ( youtube ) , listen to music on pandora , and work a puzzle or play a game
because i enjoyed my nook so much , i decided to purchase the nook hd because it is much lighter in weight and more compact in size
now that i have purchased the nook hd i have some pros and cons about the product
nothing serious , i will give myself a little more time to get used to it
but i am concerned about the short battery life
pros : light weight and smaller than the previous tablet ; great video picture quality and the sound is very good even without the earbuds
cons : i have to get used to the new interface , the previous tablet was easier to use and navigate ; when playing games and connecting to the web using , i have to charge frequently because it uses up the battery very quickly&<HASHTAG> ; i may have to carry my charger with me ; not as many fonts to choose from like the previous tablet
overall , i am pleased with my nook hd tablet
once i have resolved some of the cons with this product , i will be a little more comfortable with using it on a daily basis .
it has everything you need in a tablet , except it doesn not have a camera , 3g or gps , personally i don not need them
but guess what
it is built in microphone
that is good , i like to sing
this tablet has a good touch response , you can touch even the smallest links , the screen is extremely crisp and beautiful 900x1440 pixel the highest resolution in the <NUM> inch tablets !
i was amazed at how beautiful google maps is displayed , i loved it
it has a 1
3 ghz processor and <NUM> gb of ram , it is quick and very responsive but don not abuse , it is only a tablet
i decided to get this tablet instead of the asus nexus <NUM> because it is lighter , it only weights <NUM> oz , this is a good factor if you are planning to use it for long periods of time
i use it for reading colored magazines and illustrative books
besides it is easy to grip
the battery last about <NUM> hours if you use it only for reading , and about <NUM> hrs if you watch videos or use it in mode
the new software updates give you access to google play
it couldn not be easier
you don not deal with any annoying promos and the charger and wire is included .
bought a <NUM> gb one at my local b&n ; store , on sale at $119
fantastic ! it is totally android , hooked right into the googleplex
like google maps , and the google play apps store
where , you guessed it , i immediately downloaded the free '' amazon kindle app , perfect ! ( i might buy the b&n ; tablet , but books ? amazon all the way )
and free acrobat reader , which will still enlarge any vector line art in a pdf to <PERCENT> , just like on a pc/mac
note -- flash and video embedded in a pdf do not play on the nook , or , to my knowledge , on any other tablet , or on macs
let is see
photos ( originals are <NUM> x 1200 ) shown from my smugmug site are in perfect color on the 7" nook screen
i am an amateur photographer , and it is a joy to see my images displayed absolutely correctly
other stuff -- it has a microsd card slot so you can bring in your own pix , docs , pdfs , etc
will buy a microsd card for it tomorrow
as an aside , there is a company called n2acards that sells a microsd card with the android operating system
but , with the nook hd 'in bed' with google , i am not sure what i am missing by just sticking with the nook is system
anyway , i am very happy with this product
if it blows up , i can take it back to my local b&n ; store and get another
and it has a feature where it backs up all your content on google servers
lastly , was able to connect it to my yahoo account immediately
it also has facebook and twitter , but i turned them off as i am fairly .
had some initial problems , sound output was so low that i could not hear it
tech support said to it and reboot
that cured that problem
then wifi would disconnect without any apparent cause
called tech support <NUM> times , they were helpful and courteous , but we could not solve that problem
finally tech support asked me if i had inserted a minisd card , i had
they told me to check to see if that it was corrupted , it was
that card solved wifi problem , although just why it was causing this problem is still a mystery to me
if you have problems with your nook , and you are not able to solve them , and you have inserted a minisd card , try it
i have an apple ipad , i bought the nook to help me learn and understand android
i find android substantially less user friendly , and the apps cost more and do not work as well
more importantly , at least to me , is the fact that there are at least a dozen apps that i use all the time that have no equivalent in android
in short , i will not be buying an android phone to replace my iphone anytime soon .
i bought the hd first and am completely in love with it
a very handy size and very responsive
bought the hd+ for use when size is not a factor
love both
added <NUM> gig scandisk to both
only real issue is that i run ubuntu , no windows/mac , so had to cobble my desktop and laptop to ba able to download to nook
can set video downloads to default to sd card
very happy
thinking about buying one more of each if the price goes even lower , for backups in case of loss or damage .
i bought the nook primarily for reading but wanted the hd for email and web browsing also
i was pleasantly surprised at the exceptional screen quality and ease of setup
i did not want to spend the money for an ipad and now i am glad i didn not as i prefer the nook interface for reading
the screen brightness can be changed anytime during reading but on the ipad you have to go into settings after exiting the book you are reading
the only downside is there are not as many apps written for the nook
i am hoping that will change .
with all the tablets and apps out we don not really need ereaders anymore
i am not exactly sure why i wanted a e reader
i mean , i have a ipod , ipad , kindle , regular nook , ipad mini , iphone , blackberry playbook
i decided to sell my kindle fire and my previous color nook tablet and upgrade to the snow nook hd and its beautiful , it also has google apps on here now so we can get a lot of android apps , including the ahem// kindle app
i like the nook friends and borrowing books options as well as how clean the os is .
if you are looking for a very light and compact device to read your books , check your and watch movies , you really can not beat the nook hd
it has the highest screen resolution for its form factor ( 7" ) and is a pleasure to read and write with
netflix & hulu+ are magical to view since the resolution is so high and it is so darn light
being able to expand the memory with a micro sd card is just another plus
, i am very pleased with it an would recommend it highly !
why pay to be restricted , i simply didn not see the benefit with all of the other tablets out there having apps that perform exactly the same tasks
just decided to go a cheaper route and i am so glad i did
maybe i would consider the nook again if it is expanded beyond a .
we have both the hd and the hd+ but i love the hd because it is lightweight and very portable
all my nooks are converted to android and work very well .
it is too bad that the nook hd hasn not received more kudos
to be honest , i knew it had a great screen , a fast proce fast processor , great battery life , and oh so light and easy to handle
but , i did wait for a means for rooting the nook hd to become available
now the tablet lives up to all its potential
rooting is quite easy and it is a great tablet
this is a really nice item
with the way i use it , the battery life lasts for several days of reading and browsing the web
magazines on this screen are amazing , i especially like reading time because of the outstanding photography they do
books look great , and the selection of games on the barnes and noble store is alright
a little annoying paying again for games i already bought on my phone , but that is not so bad
further , you really don not need to pay again for games if you install a custom rom on an sd card
you can either purchase one premade ( google for n2a for more info ) or you can burn your own if you google a little more and spend the afternoon trying different things
it is not scary at all , especially since you are only doing stuff on the sd card not the tablet itself
if you want to undo it , just take the card out ! anyway , the custom rom just gets you stock android , and that opens this great device up to the full android market of games and apps
you can still read all your barnes and noble stuff on the b&n ; android app
i read my wired subscription that way , as well as some books
anyway , i think this device and the rom on the sd card is the best of b&n ; and android
anyway , i'd compare this with the google nexus 7
the nook has a slightly higher resolution screen , which is kinda neat especially for magazines
no front facing camera on the nook , but my phone already is great for video chat so i don not miss it
also , the custom rom i put on my sd card is android 4
2 , whereas google says the nexus is android 4
maybe they will get an update soon i don not know
so , either way , you probably can not lose
edit : barnes and noble opened up the stock software to be able to use almost all of the apps in the google play store
so , i don not use my custom rom at all , because of the better battery life and just overall fit and finish of the barnes and noble stock software
it is a great tablet !
mixed up the review to show how the nook changed with updates within <NUM> hours of opening the box
opened the nook packaging with great anticipation
the instruction set is barely nuts and bolts but it gives one the essentials
it passed the back pocket test famously
this was done straightaway
was very pleased with this feature
but buyer beware
i discovered this nook tablet has no camera at all
who ever heard of such a thing ? there is a reasonable expectation
the nook downloaded and upgraded itself famously
everything was smooth and cheerful
the speed of the nook was very good in my opinion
page to page was smooth and cheerful and moderately fast
the book pages are easy to read
another dan brown book ( i think )
made the discovery with inferno
played/watched linux action show and other video for about <NUM> hours with about <PERCENT> of the battery power left
checked youtube and amazon to see the how the graphic is engine worked in the nook
the motion pictures were crisp and clear on youtube and amazon
the sound was very excellent and voluminous much to my surprise
can hear the device clearly and with ease even though i am kinda hard of hearing
the movie scenes moved like a big computer rendering of the graphics
the motion pictures were like a tv broadcast
not kidding
now the ultimate bummer : their much touted microsdhc card can not play your own content downloaded from a computer
later , several hours later there was an additional patch of <NUM> upgrades that made the microsdhc capable of playing video files/movies
the selection it can play is very limited compared to other more recent operating systems in android devices
the latest android operating system is 4
4 kitkat
the nook will not play certain avi or hd files
it is very persnickety what the nook can play is rendered exceptionally well indeed
it can only play things downloaded from nooks libraries for as mentioned
i would have never bought this dohickey if i knew thee was no camera natively in advance
one always takes for granted a camera
and their microsdhc is nothing short of a
jeez- wrong now
my chinese brand x tablets can play my media content in avi
mp3/4 and other popular media formats very well indeed
these brand x tablets can play far more movie/video files than the nook
their android versions are newer than the nook is
the back pocket thing was a real plus
great sound
great graphics
good speed
but these pluses can not counter balance the negatives
the camera is not as important as real robust motion graphics and awesome sound to me
now i am thinking i will keep this nook because it does have a viable if not bugged up microsdhc card port capable of music and motion picture replay
forget file sharing in android
b&n ; needs a no brainer award for greed and stupidity just like apple , kindle and nexus
apple , kindle and nexus deserve the award more because the nook is microsdhc does work but has limited compatibility with the files/apps that can play these type of music and movie files
now i have to go through the hassle of returning this thingamajig
may keep this on the hope there will be patches further to play music and movie files
if you need a camera don not buy this .
the nook tablet is a great color with the "bonus" of being able to read your email , shop on amazon
com , surf the web , watch tv shows on hulu plus , movies on netflix , and listen to the world is largest selection of music on pandora radio
i added a 16gb sd card filled with thousands of my favorite songs
but , the nook is designed to be an ereader
it is not a games tablet , or an ipad
i got my nook tablet ( 8gb version ) from barnes & noble because of the extra discount i got with my b&n ; membership
the price was much less than advertised by most internet venders
i already have a brand x color and a nook simple touch reader
my old color reader was hard on my eyes for long reading sessions , the nook touch is great for books , but it does not have internet access or play music and magazines don not really work without a color screen
the nook tablet has very sharp , clear , and contrasty fonts and is very pleasant to read , even for several hours
there is a night mode , and also a sephia mode for reading in bed without bothering anyone else
magazines look great on its color screen
i listen to music on pandora while i read , and when i am tired of reading , i can watch a movie on netflix or a tv show on tv
i installed the dolphin browser which uses tabs so i can switch quickly among various web pages
vevo music videos look great , but the nook is speaker is too weak to enjoy music
however , music sounds great through good ear buds and when i plug the nook into my computer speakers
the nook is an , not an or high powered tablet
it does not have access to google play to obtain apps , so you are limited to the apps in the nook app store
those apps have been developed just for the nook and its seven inch screen
the apps in google play are mostly designed for the smaller screens of cell phones , while nook apps are designed just for the nook
bottom line : the nook tablet 8gb is a terrific way to read books and magazines while enjoying your favorite music ( i loaded a 16gb memory card with thousands of my favorite songs
transferring the songs over to the nook from my laptop was fast and easy )
for folks who want the "full" tablet experience , amazon
com sells the n2a card which enables you to boot your nook into a full tablet mode , with access to google play , and the 400 , 000 apps available there
and , the n2a card also permits booting the nook back into its original nook settings , as the card does not modify any of the nook is software or settings .
between this and other popular competitors there isn not a lot of difference in hardware
the software and usability is noticeably different though , and that is where you should pay close attention
i bought my wife the nook tablet for christmas and she uses it a fair amount
i haven not heard any major complaints from her but here are the ones i have heard most often
the barnes and noble app store is a joke
i looked through it for about <NUM> minutes and barely ever saw a free app
many popular apps and games are there , but usually you can only get the paid version
adding insult to injury , is difficult if not impossible without rooting the device ( this will void the warranty )
i didn not expect to be a given really , but if you block those apps you really need a decent app store to make up for it
the sd card slot , which many people may not ever use , is in a pretty odd spot
it is not really hard to pry back the cover but since you are working with a card it can be really annoying to line up such a tiny card in the slot
if that wasn not annoying , it is definitely annoying to load your pdfs or whatever from the sd card once its inserted
for someone who isn not really it isn not obvious how to read those files
the reader app could really do a better job of detecting documents when the sd card is inserted
on the aesthetic side the launcher could use some work
although i think the scrolling app dock at the bottom is slightly more elegant than a app drawer , there is little organization to the home screen
you can drag icons around , to and from the dock , but apps/books don not lock to any kind of grid on the home screen
some of us who are more anal retentive just won not stand for two icons being less than parallel
you can see a better view of your media by opening the library app , which is a nice app , but i find the contrast displeasing , further emphasizing this is a tablet with functions ( or vice versa maybe )
basically the cohesion isn not there and you start to wonder , with all of the restrictions , why you didn not just get a regular tablet
i still haven not rooted my wife is tablet but maybe if something annoys her enough she will let me do it
otherwise , if you are not planning to root the nook , beware of its restrictions and browse its app store for a bit to see if the selection and prices are a
this is an first and a tablet second
if you are satisfied with its capabilities i am sure you will be happy with this device .
honestly , i was really just interested in getting an ebook reader , so you won not hear me whining ( much ) about how the nook is functionality was crippled by b&n
what tipped the scales towards the nook ( instead of the kindle , which was the other main contender for my money ) , was its compatibility with the epub file format
it is very tightly integrated with barnes & noble is store , and as long as you are only interested in either books from that retailer or sideloading your own books via usb cable , you will be satisfied with this device
unless you are willing to root it , you won not be able to sideload apps from a computer , and you also won not be able to access google is play store or amazon is app store
definitely a if you are looking to buy a fully functional android tablet , but it works well for my own purposes .
my nook tablet has really made reading fun again ! i was sick and tired of fiddling with reading lights while trying to read in the dark and , after seeing my friend is kindle fire , decided to pick up a tablet for myself
the barnes and noble app market is a bit weak , but i bought my nook to read , so aside from a few games and basic applications its been a strictly literary experience for me
the backlight is great for reading in the dark , and i haven not had any issues with glares while reading in the sun
the stock web browser is fine for basic browsing , but if you are looking for a true tablet experience you might want to wait for the google nexus <NUM> tablet
the nook tablet however , as it stands , is an excellent /tablet for $200 !
8/2012 - best screen on a 7" tablet for the price range
seriously , ipad quality and even sold my ipad <NUM> for this ! =d very happy and would not go back
1 ) lighter than an ipad
thus , easy to hold for extended viewing
can not with the ipad
2 ) screen quality is ips and matches that of the ipad
no issues with resolution , contrast , color , etc
one of the best screens , esp
for low reflections off a glossy display tablet out there at this time
one of the biggest reasons i bought this
far less shine than the annoying ipads
3 ) nice loop hole for a strap - wii strap works great ! never drop it again ! 4 ) microsd card slot ! yes ! expand and drag&drop ; media as you see fit , along with cm7
5 ) plays more media formats than the ipad
mx player pretty much kills the ipad for how easy it is to play everything up to <NUM> on this tablet
6 ) runs + hours easily reading ebooks
in short , for the price range and time of this post , nothing else 'better' for a 7" tablet
wouldn not go back to my ipad2 ever , and extremely happy with this - total keeper for all it can do ! xd
the nook preformed perfectly and was easy to set up
i checked lots of ratings before i ordered it , and they were all good
this was my first tablet so i did not realize that it did not have some of the specific features i was looking for
i did return it
i must say though that the camera on the nook was much better than camera on my new one .
 ( update ) i find my review written about nook hd included here for an entirely different model tablet
amazon or b*n this is unethical ! d
---------------nook hd overviewgreat screen , no cameras , weak speakers , crappy battery life , compromised android os , but an inexpensive way to browse web and run the world of android apps on a fast , beautiful display
plus it has a microsd slot to hold lots of videos for offline viewing
and of course , its original purpose , to provide a slick interface for purchase and reading of magazines and books
pluseswide range of browers available
i have <NUM> on my machine
all browsers for tablets have reduced functionality so some browsers are better than others for specific tasks
for example , firefox will play video in hd and does not redirect to mobile sites
tint and zirco have a homepage that will access a local html file
with several browsers installed it is easier to get around site restrictions
firefox has an addon that cookies
chrome allows spoken search inputs
the world of 700 , 000 android apps can now be accessed on nook hd including big and nice apps : google earth , skype , youtube in hd , adobe reader , wifi analyzer , wifi fixer ( essential wifi tool ) , google maps , best solitaire ever ( by mobilityware ) , and free 'run' games
custom moving backgrounds on nook hd home screens are fun
annoyancesin two months i have not figured out how to add a browser link to nook hd home page
some browsers have the option to add a link to the homepage , but it never works ! ( it must be that the nook hd os does not allow this ) poor battery life , by test i get only <NUM> hours
adroid apps normally just suspend , so it tends to take too many presses and taps to cleanly start an application
audio does not shut off when you exit most radio and music apps
with no os support for shutting apps down i often have to resort to a reset to silence them
email has a short time window so you only see few or no messages
apps like fasthotmail can provide workaround
screen capture is clumsy ( pushing home and vol- requires a lot of force and nearly simultaneous pushes )
nook hd not really useful for music , sans headphones , because sound volume on speakers is relatively low
setting up icons on home screens is kind of a pain
half of the main screen is taken up by a carousel that cannot be removed
the nook recommended way of moving an icon to an adjacent screen is to hold icon overlapping the edge , but i find this hit or miss , it only seems reliable after a reset
file directories can be accessed via usb , but have some annoyances : many file managers have a hard time finding personal files lost in a maze of os directories
nook hd allows deletion of its standard user directories ( like 'kids b&n ; files' ) only to later write them back again
tablet does not reliably remember some settings
occasionally i find the screen will be dim or the notification is too loud and when i look the setting has changed
no way ( that i have found ) to add personal data for quick entry
( update ) bluetooth keyboard problem solvedi have an inexpensive bluetooth keyboard that works fine with another tablet ( blackberry playbook ) , but i could not get it to work with nook hd
it would pair fine , but nothing happened when keys are hit
i see others complaining of this too
finally i solved the problem with an app called blueinput ( available on play store )
it now does the pairing , not nook os , and you select the bluetooth keyboard using iswitch keyboard' icon
( update ) fix for adding web link icons to the home page
some browsers have the option to add a bookmark to home , but this never seemed to work in nook hd
i think i now understand the source of the problem
the default nook hd launcher ( with carousel ) ignores them
the work around is to install the nova launcher , and it will show them on the home screens .
if you buy this from a b&n ; store , and are a member of b&n ; , you can get this for $174 , which is cheaper than the <NUM> gig fire
if you already are loaded with kindle books , b&n ; foolishly doesn not have a kindle app , but you can , on amazon or n2a
com buy an n2a card which allows you to boot your nook up as a full android complete with access to the android market ( or whatever google is calling it now ) , and get the kindle app to accress all your kindle books
since i love the design of the ereader on the nook , i use my n2a card only when i want a kindle book
i find the b&n ; nook books are usually the same price as kindle
occasionally , kindle doesn not have a book i want but nook does
also , nook may not have a book kindle has
also , nook books have the page perfect series , as well as enhanced editions with embedded videos and audio clips , neither of which kindle has
the nook has a tab for "my stuff" so you can drag things from your pc to the nook
if you want more space for your stuff , you can get any sized san disk for the nook
i have a <NUM> gb one because i transferred about 4 , 000 pictures to my nook and am using an app to edit the pictures and then make slide shows of them
then i will drag the shows back onto my computer and burn them to disc
did i mention the nook is a joy to use ? i actually got thre 16gig tablet but the <NUM> gig is as fast and has the <NUM> 1/2 hour battery as well as allows the same cards to be added .
three of my children are sharing it now
i do not see the need to buy another tablet because i do not allow them to play with it too much
my oldest child uses it for email , news , weather , and more while in school
she prefer it to a computer even she has to share with her sister and brother
it starts in seconds , it weights less and is firm enough to be put in her school bag ( with cover of cause )
it has the convenient access to the free istory books , free classical books , and some games that my children occasionally play with
my older children would record some of the books for my smaller children to listen
it save me a lot of time to read to them
the dictionary is at their fingers
not a bad gadget for education .
excellent display quality
it runs fast , and does have more memory than its predecesor
the size is appropriate for my day to day needs .
the price of this tablet i do love
thats about it
first of all the design of the the tablet feels very cheap
almost the whole shell of the nook is plastic
since also the home nook button neing plastic sometimes it gets stuck and makes it hard to push
the format of the homepage i do not like
if you want new wallpaper you have to download a picture file file onto your nook same with music and video
you do get the apps hulu netflix and pandora but thats very limited
whats also very limited is the app store
what a joke
the apps are all very boring and overpriced
the book are usually never free
the only up to this tablet it you can watch flash video which is basically the only upside to this piece of junk
either save up your money for an ipad or or kindle fire
i will be returing my nook !
i bought my wife a nook for christmas two years ago , and she has used the heck outof it , so i have always wanted one for myself
when i saw the price break on this onei had to act ! it meets all my expectations .
i have mixed feelings about the tablet
i really like and don not like features of this tablet
i am keeping my fingers crossed that later versions improve the potential of the nook
like : 1
layout and function of touch screen is intuitive - the kindle fire requires instruction2
. the hardware is solid4
the price is competitive5
netflix and hulu are available and app market is expandingdon not like : 1
no bluetooth or gps2
do not have access to the full android market3
no video rental option - apple and amazon tablet have better market places4
only <NUM> gb memory and although it can be expanded with microsd , less convenient than other tablets5
the is not as good as a kindle but then what is ? at least the ipad allows for the kindle appfor now , i am sticking with my kindle fire over this nook but i am keeping my options open for future purchases .
i bought my 8gb b&n ; nook new for $149
at $200 list price i would say it is a and i am still not thrilled that i spent $150 on it
pros : expandable storage via
reliably plays mp4 video and files
netflix and hulu plus apps are reliable and have good interfaces
reliable ( but not particularly ) wireless antennae
bright screen with good color , contrast , and resolution
responsive touch screen
good battery life
cons : web browser is slow , unreliable , and crashes often
limited , closed operating system with expensive applications
headphone jack is - too quiet and scratchy with some of my speakers
horizontal / vertical screen calibration lacks enough customization options
made from cheap plastic - cover slot fell off
no way to rent movies or tv episodes from nook store
music player that has problems playing some mp3s that other devices can play just fine
it is good as a potable media player but is definitely nerfed as a portable computer
if other tablets were priced in the same $150 range i would have rather got something a lot more customizable with access to free apps .
purchased as a christmas gift for my son
he loves it
best gift ( according to him )
we loaded a few of his faborite games and downloaded some books
he loves to read , and hasn not put this down since unwrapping it
hightly recommend .
i assumed that i had the 16gb model but the box was misbranded and my bad for not paying attention , too late to take back to the store but it is still a very good tablet and the memory can still be expanded by sd card
i have since rootedmy tablet and it is great ! i do have the 16gb one after all .
pros : the hardware is nice , i have the 8gb - its fast , responsive and the screen is beautiful
great for reading books and netflix
battery life - read 'catching fire' and 'mockingjay' on a single charge
email and web are decent too - nothing special
cons : the b&n ; nook os and the b&n ; app selection are both terrible
the nook os is and not user friendly , there is no back button ! ? take a toll of how often you use the back button on your phone or android device and you will realize how annoying the lack of this simple feature is
you can hit the 'n' and go back to home any time - though often i wanted to go back , not start over
the selection of apps in the app store are laughable
i literally could not find a single app i wanted , even searching apps that they advertise like comics for nook ( not installed ? not available ? )
i found a few apps for $4
99+ that i have downloaded for free on itunes and google play ( android market )
recommendation : buy this -n2a ( tm ) - 32gb nook to android bootable microsd card for the nook colortakes the good hardware of the nook tablet and replaces the useless os with trusted full android
read the reviews , they are all true ! before i bought this card , the nook was basically useless and frustrating - now i have an android tablet and since it is not rooted , still have warranty too , though i recommend squaretrade
check my n2a review for more info
update : i have had this tablet for over <NUM> months now and love it
i have had no issues and all my friends and family want one
note : i use this exclusively with the n2a card in android mode
n2a recently emailed me with the update from gingerbread to jellybean and its working great and their customer service is excellent
i cannot recommend this company/product enough .
it is ok for adults
fine for older adults who are just looking to use it to read but the place where this thing shines the brightest , it is bomb proof
i gave one to my toddler boys last year and it still works <PERCENT>
it has been spilled on , dropped , stomped on , drooled on , left in the sun and even got closed in the auto door shut in our crappy minivan and it is almost perfect
a scratch here or there but truely you could never tell what torment this device has been through
i wish i could get an apple device this durable
in the same time that i have owned this tablet my family , ( self and husband included ) has killed no less that <NUM> smart phones , an ipad , one samsung device and a dvd player
the device has also survived multiple refreshes and side loading software experiments with out even flinching
i will say that the b&n ; app store is pretty pitiful but like i said it is easy as pie to sideload the google play store and have access to pretty much anything you want .
the nook 7&<HASHTAG> ; 8gb wifi tablet was a christmas gift for my husband
he had a plain nook for reading
this upgrade seemed logical because he already had a nook account
the new nook takes cards he already had
he loves it .
this is very amazing
it has a ton of features and has a great looking vividview touchscreen
here are some of the features and things it can do
-very strong , i dropped mine from <NUM> feet to wood floor and it was fine
-very fast but slow at navigating the home screen
-has a physical home button which comes in handy in case you want to quit something
-has expandable memory so you can have tons of content on this
-you can personalize the home screen with your own wallpaper
- loads pages fast and plays videos well
-has a vividview touchscreen which does what it says and makes everything vivid
-the os is tweaked which is nice if you don not care about android
-the microphone works great
-it has physical volume buttons
over all this is a very good tablet if you just need to do basics like read , email , play games , play videos and search the web
it can also do more than basics .
highly disappointed
i purchased the new b/w touch version of the nook and had intended to use it for lecturing in class when i need to do it from the book
i didn not know that you couldn not download the etextbooks to my nook from the nookstudy part of barnes and nobles
why would you call this nookstudy if you can not download the textbooks to a nook reader ? seriously ! i could live with the some of the shortfalls for this device ( slow touch response , flickering on the screen when changing pages , keyboard mistypes characters , etc ) , but not being able to download a textbook from something that says "nook"study ? smacks of misrepresentation , somebody should sue
on the nookstudy web page , it says that a "nook" is not required , it should say , "not intended for nook devices"
also , it will not load onto any other device that has the nook app , only on a pc or a mac
they should rename it to "desktop study" , using the nook label when you can not use it on a nook device is false advertising ( anybody want to sue ? )
anyway , i am returning this and buying a kindle ( at least amazon will tell you what devices you can install their etextbooks , i
almost all their kindles , mac , pc and oh , an ipad ! )
if your planning on buying this for your college bound student , get them a kindle instead .
this nook has a very nice format and is very easy to operate and view
the only draw back is the battery life is terrible
i am charging this unit twice a day
my former simple touch only needed charging once a month &<HASHTAG> ; with the wifi on&<HASHTAG> ; all the time
i would not recommend this product .
if anyone have used previous version of nook you will immediately see the improvements on new version of nook
one of the most important feature i found on the new nook was better page turn response
the screen refresh when moving from page to page is much quicker , nearly matching the refresh rates of the latest kindle
the nook also added a laundry list of interface and usability improvements , such as the ability to organize your book collection by category which is called "shelves"
i liked <NUM> x <NUM> display screen
it comes with <NUM> shades of gray and is easy to your eyes
i can read all day without hurting my eyes
my personal opinion , i would love this device more if i could read it at night without lights
proslibrary with thousands of books , magazine that comes free , free wireless data network , plus connectivity ( no pc needed ) ; separate capacitive color pad for navigation , and a virtual keyboard for notes and annotations ; 2gb of internal memory ( capable of storing 1 , 500 electronic books ) as well as a microsd expansion slot for additional memory ; font style and size are adjustable ; displays image files and plays mp3 music files ; compatible with windows and mac machines ; battery is removable and ; allows free browsing of books while within barnes & noble stores ; you can lend certain for up to <NUM> days free of charge ; epub format compatibility lets you read free google books and loaner from your local library ; page turn speeds are faster with firmware upgrade
the bad : no protective carrying case included ; color lcd ( for color nook ) has an impact on battery life ; for black & white battery is really good , reading and loaning capabilities come with notable limits and caveats ; no support for word or text files ; no ability to download books when outside the u
, even when on
does it beat kindle ? according to design my answer is no
the amazon kindle is lighter , thinner , and simply feels a little better to hold in your hand
it also offers double the battery life , more internal memory ( 4gb versus 2gb )
but the new upgrades has given some new features to nook that are not available in kindle
nook should definitely remain under consideration when you are shopping for readers
the decision may come down to a personal preference , such as how you feel about the color navigation screen versus the hard keyboard found on the kindle
if my review did not answer any questions , leave a comment below and i will try my best to answer your question .
this tablet from barnes and noble is an afforadable alternative to the ipad
serves more than one purpose
while its primary function is reading
the original nook is a whole family experience
its size and durability give the nook , nook color , and nook tablet are built with quality materials so that they have longevity
this is a gift for the teachers assistant at my sons school
she wanted something to read her books on , and since i have the nook color i figured this would be a good start for her
barnes and noble nook ebook reader ( wifi only ) [ black & white]
i bought this unit as a gift for the grandchildren to read books
my plan was test it out and buy <NUM> if it worked
i planned to buy gift cards for the unit so the kids could buy books
barnes and noble requires a credit card to activate this unit ! that is a show stopper as it is not desirable for young children to have a unit with credit card information linked to it
they could lose the unit etc
i loaded my credit card information to test the unit
after deciding to return the unit i talked to customer service about deleting my account information
the answer from <NUM> people was you can not delete your account information
i can not recommend this company .
i bought the nook last week , its always a joyous experience to buy something from a store , activation was easy on the device , took some time to create new account on barnes and noble site , but i was ready to go in <NUM> minutes
i purchased one book and started reading immediately , after <NUM> days , suddenly the screen went darker
the device comes with one year warranty , i took it to the store and they replaced it in <NUM> minutes , again , the store experience was great
pros : 1- the device look and feel is good , design is sleek and smooth
2- touch screen is a good idea , i have tendinitis so i prefer to use touch screen over keyboard
3- the page turn keys are in good place , very comfortable to read and hold at the same time
4- found many books on the library search , it has detailed editorial and user reviews , with ratings , just like amazon site
5- the format is not proprietary , this was a huge sale point for me , there are other devices that can read the same format
6- battery is replaceable and memory sd slot is available
cons : 1- the touch screen is sluggish , you need to use it slower than using other touch devices , this is either buggy hardware or cpu is too slow
2- first device i got was defective , not a good sign , hopefully the second one is better
3- browsing the web is ok , but using the small touch screen to navigate through html is not an easy task , especially since it is sluggish
4- not all books are available in the library , i found a psychology book in the store that did not exist for download
5- you need to use screw driver to open the back cover and replace battery or insert sd card
6- little bit heavy , certainly heavier than a medium size hard cover book .
i purchased both the kindle ( ) and this nook ( the original ) and tried them out during the return period
while there were things about the kindle i really liked ( better screen contrast , and many other features that other reviewers on the kindle site had written ) , the one thing that made me choose the nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library
haven not been back to the library since ! now here comes the nook simple touch ( nook st ) ereader
it is just now starting to show up in b&n ; stores ( not on amazon yet )
i was lucky enough to find a store near me that had one that was not spoken for yet
i bought it yesterday and have been busy trying it out
it has the same pearl screen as the kindle , so the screen contrast is no longer an issue
and wow , has the user interface improved over the original nook ! ( which i thought was clunky ) the entire pearl screen has full touchscreen capability
on both the kindle and the original nook , i felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read , instead of using the buttons ( on the kindle ) or the lcd touchscreen ( on the original nook ) to highlight and select the desired ebook
on the nook st , the library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device ( both library and purchased )
touch the icon , and the ebook opens
turning the page ? touch the screen on the right side of the page ( to go forward ) or the left side ( to go back )
or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page
or use the buttons built into the frame
want to page quickly through a book ? hold down the page turning button
need a word definition ? touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up
the user interface resembles that of an iphone or ipad , with the icons , virtual keyboard and the physical home button
it even has the "slide to unlock" feature like the iphone
the touchscreen on the nook st is infrared ( it senses the heat of your finger , again like iphone ) , so a light touch works just fine
i found that on the original nook , sometimes it would take multiple touches on the lcd screen for the device to recognize a command
i returned the original nook since the nook st is so much better
note that the nook st doesn not have 3g connectivity , a web browser , or an mp3 player
if you want all that , buy the original nook
if you don not require all of these features and would like a basic with an intuitive touch screen interface , then take a look at the nook st
the nook st is just beginning to become available ( only at b&n ; right now ) , but i suspect that amazon and other high quality retailers will be selling it very soon
here is another plus for the nook ( whether it is the original one or the st )
the kindle has a proprietary ebook format that limits your options in purchasing and reading ebooks
nook uses adobe epub , which is an open format and there are multiple online sites that offer books in this format ( including most public libraries ) .
i was the biggest nook/kindle hater on the planet before being gifted this nook
i would constantly diss the claiming that books were soooo much better
then i ordered a book series from amazon and the books/print was so tiny that i could barely read them without straining my eyes and driving myself crazy
my mom ( &lt ; 3 ! ) gave me my brothers old nook since he had a new nook color so i could download and read the series on this
it wasn not cheap to download the books , but compared to reading the free versions a friend had sent me ( which were horrible because the text was all messed up
typos galore ) but the option to make the text larger or smaller and the clarity of the screen made the 8+ dollars per book soooo worth the price
the battery on this lasts so long it is insane
i would read daily maybe <NUM> hours per day over the summer ( hey , i had to finish the series before school resumed ! ) and i only had to charge it once a week tops , even then the battery wasn not drained i just didn not want to give it a chance to run out
i am so in love with my nook now it is insane
i can download almost any book i could possibly need and carry it around in this tiny little , lightweight nook
another big plus
my bookmarks don not fall out of the nook ! nothing is more frustrating than losing your place and going bananas trying to find it without revealing something you haven not read yet
also , when it comes to textbooks this is a lifesaver ! my back loves the nook
i cannot recommend the nook ( or any in general ) enough
you can still buy physical books ( i do and will never stop because i absolutely love them ) but for an avid reader the nook is such a great addition to your life
even though my first nook was free ( making it that much sweeter ) , i would gladly lay down $100+ for a replacement if anything happened to mine or for a newer model , not the color though , that is more like a tablet pc than an .
i asked for this for christmas due to seeing it in a barnes and noble store and learning about its features
it offers greater compatibility with different ebook formats than the kindle ( particularly the epub format ) , has access to special offers when you are inside a barnes and noble store , and permits you to lend books to other nook users
there is also a little color lcd touch screen at the bottom for accessing menu options
personally , i haven not taken advantage of most of the nook is features yet , but i do like what i see so far
the touchscreen adds a great deal of versatility to the device and i'd say it is easier to access menu options this way than with just one screen and some buttons
i also appreciate the ability to upgrade the memory with a microsd card , but i would have preferred to do so without opening the device
also , if you have a problem with the nook , you shouldn not have a problem getting a replacement
i , er , damaged my first nook through , shall we say , "user error , " but b&n ; staff was happy to provide a new one for me
it is not quite perfect , though
it is kind of heavy , for one thing
the touchscreen is a bit slow to respond and can significantly drain the battery , for another
and , some of the nook is buttons seem to be a little too stiff
i prefer soft , clicky buttons , you know ? maybe in its next iteration the nook will have proper buttons instead of this "bendy plastic" business
anyway , which you get largely boils down to your personal preferences , and which retailer is online library you'd rather have access to
for my part , i think the nook satisfies all of my needs just fine
be careful where you buy it from , though
$180 , which is the price it is selling for on amazon right now , is way too much when you can just walk into a brick and mortar store and get it for thirty bucks less .
i bought a nook about <NUM> months ago
i wanted to consider a kindle but they were not available locally so i was very hesitant to buy one
bn had just released their version for $149 which was very reasonable
i bought one from bn with moderate research and minimal
i have regretted it ever since
today i said goodbye to my nook library and bought a kindle3
i can not comment on it very much except it is faster than the nook and the interface actually works
i have about <NUM> books in my nook library , most of which i paid for so i am a little frustrated
things that are good about the nook : 1
it looks much better than a kindle
while it sits there unused on my nightstand
epub support
i live in alaska which means it will be another <NUM> years before our libraries start loaning books via epub so it is not a big deal for me
free fridays
every friday nook owners can download a book for free
most are crappy fantasy/romance books but i have discovered several very good authors that i wouldn not have otherwise
things that are bad about the nook : 1
awful , awful , awful touch input
i cringe thinking about using my nook with the unwieldy touchscreen
the screen itself is slow to respond , it sometimes registers additional clicks but mostly just ignores them while giving you visual feedback so you wait seconds for it to actually do nothing
the touchscreen display is very jerky and difficult to navigate
you navigate the menus by scrolling through them on the touchpad
it will randomly jump to the top or the bottom
it will randomly ignore a touch ( there is visual feedback , so it is not a )
it will randomly click twice on the succeeding menus
trying to type on the keyboard or use it to look up a word ( you need to use arrow keys on the touchpad to scroll a sluggish cursor around the page to pick one ) is a test in patience i no longer have patience for
the keys provide visual feedback when pressed
this suggests you can type away merrily until you look at the text field to see only <NUM> or <NUM> characters were actually used
you have to type very sloooow and deliberate for the gnomes inside to catch up with you
the touchscreen is the main reason i ditched the nook
it is horribly implemented and makes the entire device borderline unusable
the bn rep sure talked that up
after spending <NUM> minutes trying to use the browser to register a bn account so i could actually read books i gave up and used my laptop
the browser takes about <NUM> seconds on average to display a page
it doesn not matter if it is a real page , the mobile version of facebook or just google search
it will also randomly crash every minute or two
and by crash i mean you will suddenly be returned to the home screen for no apparent reason
do not buy the nook if you even think you might want to try using it as a browser to check your email while you are sitting in bed reading a book
battery life sucks
sorry , but it does
i like to read a lot and having to charge it every couple days makes me upset they claim a battery life on it
i think it gets about <NUM> hours per charge ( minus the <PERCENT> when it automatically goes to sleep )
there is a persistent charging bug with the nook , or at least with mine ; if you have wifi enabled but the device is sleeping ( as in just normally leaving wifi on ) when you plug it in to charge , the wifi will activate internally as it ( i assume ) checks with bn for book updates
this stops the charging and it will not resume unless you turn off the wifi and unplug and replug the charging cable
this is very frustrating as you plug the device in and forget to turn off the wifi
the next morning you grab it only to see the cute "your battery is too low to operate" message
it weighs about <PERCENT> more than the kindle and is noticeably thicker
not a big deal , but if you are in bed reading with one hand it weighs about as much as a heavier hardcover which means you are switching hands every so often
heavier does not always mean better
page turns
when i first got the nook it took between seconds to turn a page
i would actually press the page turn button when i got to the last paragraph and could finish it before the page turned
a software update has vastly improved the page turn speed ( about
5 seconds now ) but only when turning the actual book pages
library pages , shopping and browsing shelves still take 3+ seconds
i have tried a factory reset twice and either my device is defective ( bn support did not think so ) or it still sucks
this also strongly influences the cursor movement speed when trying to select a word and the speed at which you can enter text
screen readability is acceptable
it looks like the page was printed on a crappy inkjet printer , with pixilation apparent
the kindle is more crisp and darker
the included merrium webster dictionary is broken
a large number of entries simply do not work
if you search for one of the effected entries the nook performs a search before inexplicably returning you to the book page
i do not remember which letter ( s ) are affected but it does not appear to be priority for bn to fix
shelves are bn is answer to everyone complaining how difficult it is to find books in the library
you can create a custom named shelf and place books on it
it is very clunky and sluggish and expect to spend <NUM> seconds trying to find your new book and another <NUM> trying to put it on a shelf
sometimes it just won not let you put a book on a shelf and you have to restart the nook
this adds another <NUM> hours because you will be so frustrated by this point you will put the nook down start punching holes in the wall
sometimes books fail to open
this means you have to go back to your library and open the book again
i have no idea why it happens but it happens frequently enough to mention
once you get a book open and keep reading that book until you are finished it works well enough
but the menus , navigation and overall usefulness is virtually nonexistent
it is built on an android platform , which means it is buggy and randomly crashes or stops working
a restart usually solves this , but i keep shouting "why , why , why" every time i have to
although i haven not had to restart it since i got the kindle
this may or may not be a result of not using it any more
closing thoughts : i would encourage you very strongly to use one before buying it and investing in an only to find yourself in the same situation i found myself
if you really have your heart set on it , buy from a local bn and try it out for a couple weeks so you can return it
i waited for the nook software update that was supposed to fix all these problems
after that seemingly only addressed the page turn speed i was outside of the return period and stuck with this nightstand decorum .
when i purchased this item it was still running $150
at the current price , i think it is a good deal but i am not sure it would be my choice if i could roll back time
i originally purchased this because i wanted to rent ebooks from the library and that wasn not an option with the kindle
now , they come for the kindle as well as in epub and pdf formats
you can basically use any ereader to rent these now
i read all these reviews saying that the black and white was like paper , easiest to read
it is not anything like a paper book , it is far less "bright" when it comes to reading
don not get me wrong , i love ebooks
i haven not read a paper book in a year
it is just that even in regular light it is not as easy to see for me
you absolutely can read it without a light during the day , but it is not nearly as crisp or easy as it would be with a paper book
i have a clip on light , and with that it is perfect at night
i am able to read in bed and not disturb my husband , if one wants a black and white reader as close to paper as you can get--i am just not sure this is what one would expect
this reader has a browser which you can use to get on the internet
it was handy when we were in a hotel with wifi and i didn not bring the laptop and i needed to know when a business opened
it is certainly not easy to surf , this would not be my choice to use unless in a pinch
the battery does not last as long as i expected
i get maybe a week and a half out of it , if i turn it completely off when not using it--and if i have it on airplane mode ( not wifi enabled )
i do read at least a few hours a day
the time is much shorter if i let it just hibernate
i am not sure if the text size options are specific to the device or the book
it appears to me it is the device that offers limited options , though it varies based on the originating text of the book
the text size on extra large--the largest option-- is often ( it varies by book ) small enough that it would equal that of a normal book
my vision is pretty good and occasionally i am annoyed by how small extra large is
in some books medium is the same as extra large in others
i do think that for anyone with vision challenges , limited text size might be an issue
obtaining books is easy to do through barnes and noble
you need to go online on a computer and provide a credit card
you can then order them on the computer , or through your device
i generally use the computer , but if you know what you want--ordering directly from the nook is quick and easy
transferring library rentals is also as easy as drag and drop , using adobe digital solutions ( free app , the library should have a link to download it )
all in all , it is a good ereader
i have never had any mechanical issues with it
it is sturdy and reliable .
i have been eyeballing for a while and i was absolutely certain that i was going to purchase a kindle
well many moons ago i worked at barnes and noble and stopped in to visit and old friend
he introduced me to the nook , i shrugged up my nose and said , 'yeah , i am sold on the kindle
'after playing around with the nook , i really found myself enamored of it
i like the touch screen
i like that the battery replacement if necessary is something the consumer can do
i liked that you could share your nook books with others
on the nook that i have -and i did purchase a refurbished nook - games included are suduko and chess
the daily is a feature that automatically downloads articles specifically for the nook users
the library is where you can store all of your books and create shelves for your titles and organize the titles
shopping is a breeze , either directly on the nook or online
you will need a card , be it debit or credit to purchase the books , you can use gift cards , but i believe that you need to have a card on file
i can store and listen to music on my nook , i can access the internet ( mine is wifi ) and use it to search and answer email or update facebook
in short , i am madly in love with it
i have not had any problems with it
the charge holds for a pretty long time , i haven not measured it in time myslef
it is simple to use , very friendly and there is an incredible book selection for the nook
i happen to be a big fan of classic literature and russian literature and i have had no trouble filling up my library
storage capacity is quite large and i have an additional micro sd card just in case , but i am no where near filling up my storage yet
the books are also available on my personal computer , and if i decide to archive a book , but do not necessarily want to delete the title altogether , i can archive it and later retrieve that title from my online account
archiving titles would allow you to free up space on your nook
recommendations , i have a silicone slip cover to protect my nook if i drop it , i also have a slightly hardcover case to protect the nook when it is in my purse , i do have a book light as the screens are not backlit to avoid glare
the only downside , some fools will think your screen is paper and they will touch it in awe and smudge up your reading screen .
i selected the black and white nook over the kindle because i can download books from public libraries to my laptop and copy them to the nook
we travel full time in our rv , and i have library cards in three states
i can always find books i want to read from the libraries
i haven not bought a book since i bought the nook four months ago
the display is incredible
i sit in the sun and read a lot , and the brighter the sunlight , the better the display
try that with a traditional lcd display
since the black and white nook has no backlight for the book pages , it requires as much ambient light as a traditional paper book
in dim lighting i use a book light , as i did with paper books
while i can use the nook several hours a day for several days between charges , an hour or two a day of charging keeps it charged
the nook color has a much shorter battery life , as well as being heavier
the 3g option for the nook is a waste of money unless you want to buy books and magazines directly from barnes & noble , or if you want to try to use the nook as a tablet computer
it really doesn not have the horsepower for that .
not happy with my nook
be forewarned
you can pay for some books and they will download but you can not open them
how to avoid this ? open up the description of your book on the buying site and make sure it says for nook
and not nook color or nook etc
just nook
i have had to ask for credits several times already
there aren not enough books available in my opinion to justify using the darn thing
maybe the nook color is a better bet ?
the nook takes forever to turn the page the battery life sucks it always falls out of its case ( not sure if its the case or the nook ) i have tried both nook and kindle i recommend the kindle over the nook
first let me say that when the nook first came out on the market it caught my eye
i begin to research e readers
i even went to the store and tested the nook , played with it
i went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well
then one of my coworkers showed me her kindle and i was able to play with it and look at it
then the i pad came out , so i went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well
i have read review after review and watched
well the holidays came and my husband bought me the nook ! i was so excited ! i wanted the nook as soon as i saw it , but took my time and compared it to other e readers
i knew right from the start which e reader i wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them
right out of the box the nook , made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the nook
my husband knew that i wanted it , but i waited trying to justify why i needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations
the nook did exactly that ! for me the nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase
here is why i love the nook , i can lend books to other , i can download from my library which is so awesome ! i can surf the net for free ! no monthly fees like the i pad , it fits in my computer bag , purse , which makes it so easy to take with me , it has my favorite games , chess and sukodu ! it was easy for me to download a ebook that i already have , but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around , the book loaded right from my lap top to the nook in no time
the amount of free books that are available to the nook , and the daily free treats from barnes and nobles ! which will more than pay for the nook over time
being able to call barnes and nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service
i also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks ! for me it was the right choice for our family , as when we go to barnes and nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks ! it pays for itself
these are some of the reason why i love my nook and i am excited that i received the nook for a gift ! i can not say enough about the nook , i don not have to be tied to one book store like itunes , ibook , are the kindle store
i don not like limits and the nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from
now with that said , when i visited my local barnes and nobles and received a free smoothie , it was so stress free and everyone was so nice
i could not believe it ! i have also downloaded music that i can listen to and have my ear plugs for that , i have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that i was shocked ! i like getting my monies worth , and not having to pay extra monthly fees
now with that said , i hope that when you do your research you will consider the nook , i am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews
well back to my nook , as i can not put it down ! what a great gift , and a great buy ! *update*5/30/2011the nook is still awesome
since i have owned the nook for a while now , i came back to offer an update
as far as downloading books , i downloaded books the other day and before i could blink they were on my nook ! i am still happy with my nook and love my nook ! i have recommended the nook to friends and family who have also made purchases and are happy with the nook as well
the performance of my nook is awesome , and i have had great experiences with my nook since the day i was surprised with the nook as a gift ! best gift anyone can give ! the joy of reading ! i take my nook with me every where ! my children are still in love with my nook and love to play the games on my nook or read a book
my husband even likes for the children to read books on the nook
the nook has brought so much fun and the joy of reading to our family ! you can also go to barnes and nobles and take classes to learn more about your nook as there is so much to learn and so much that the nook has to offer
check in your area to see what times your local barnes and nobles offers classes
i also like the nook because the nook continues to educate you on a daily basis with the daily blog of what took place on the days of the week , for example if you turn on your nook right now and go to the daily , it will inform you what took place on this date
which to me is a neat feature as you get to learn something new about something you may have not known
as far as the touch screen part of the nook , we love it ! it does not distract us but adds to the beauty of the nook in our opinion
it is easy for my family to use
*2012 update*well it is 4/24/2012 and i still love my nook and my nook still works great ! i just wanted to give another update for individuals looking for a e reader
as of this date , our children are now asking as they did before can they have my nook
and for now they can use my nook , but i still love nook and i am not ready to give my nook up
one day we will purchase nooks for the whole family
as far as use , i was out in the sun and reading with no problem
so many e reads and tablets are currently on the market
this nook still works for me and still performs and amazes me
there is still so much to learn with the nook i currently own
if you are looking for a great affordable e reader
don not over look nook
good luck with your decision
hopefully this update will help you in your decision
we would by one hundred more and pass them out as gifts and charity , just so people can get to read and find joy in reading ! great tool to use to educate children and adults ! back to my nook !
i have owned this original nook for two years now and have read dozens of books on it
i have also spent dozens of hours on the telephone with nook support and other activities related to keeping it running
i am an experienced software designed/programmer , engineer , etc
and i can assure you that compared to a paper book , this is a seriously flawed concept
if you insist on buying an ebook reader , make sure you allocate plenty of time that you could have better spent on reading a real book to spend on arguing on the telephone with foreign call center reps
b&n ; is concept of customer support is severely lacking and they appear to have little knowledge when it comes to supporting electronic gear
on top of those problems , consider the very concept of the electronic book
while you will pay close to the same price you'd pay for a real book on sale , you won not own the book - you will have a license to use it
when you are finished with the book , maybe you'd like to be able to loan it to a relative or friend , but you can only do that if they have a nook and you can loan it for two weeks only
i suppose when the two weeks is up , the borrower sees the book disappear , finished or not
and then there is the odd problem of your nook for some reason being tied closely to the email address you had on file with b&n ; when you registered your nook
i recently had to change my email address and updated my b&n ; account with the new address and new b&n ; password
after that , i could no longer download books , and was unable to unregister and register my nook ( that was supposed to fix the problem , according to the support center )
if you happen to get yourself into that dilemma , be ready for a long session on the telephone
the problem was that b&n ; neglected to spell this situation out on their website when i changed my email address
so , if you are into "going green" , driving a hybrid car ( and thinking it is going to save you money in the long run ) , then the nook may be for you
if all you want to do is read , forget the nook and go to the local library or bookstore and spend your time reading
give the price of the nook to a local charity
everyone will be happier .
this is the nook i dont like
it doesnot habe light to let you read at night but have a colored screen to navigate
this is poorly conceptualized as ereader
not user friendly too .
bought a nook in september 2010
used it solely in my home
now , it is february <NUM> and it had multiple lines running vertically on the screen
customer service is terrible , routes your calls to all the garbage 3rd world countries of the world
can not undersand them and they run you through all the support questions for an hour
still gets you no where
finally got a return label but i hear that they send you a refurb item back
i only bought the nook over the kindle because the nook supports drm ( free downloads from libraries and what not ) , but kindle has better controls
i will find another ereader than supports drm and eat the cost myself
maybe get an extended warranty ?
i have had my nook for about <NUM> weeks and love it
before i purchased it , i spent weeks researching the differences between the barnes and noble nook and the kindle and other ereaders
i chose the nook because i can read
epub format books on it ; something you cannot do on the kindle
the kindle only supports
pdf files and ebooks in the proprietary amazon
com format
that severely limits the number and type of ebooks you can read
with the nook , i have borrowed free ebooks from my local library and within minutes downloaded them to my computer and then transferred them to my nook
awesome ! in addition , unlike the kindle , i can read free ebooks available from google
the only thing i don not like about the nook and the kindle is that neither one of them has a screen so , at night or in the dark , you have to have alternative ample light
so i either turn on a lamp or use the small , light i bought at the local riteaid for about $10
it works just fine
so far , i have had no problems navigating my ebooks ; everything works smoothly and the pages turn quickly
i am enjoying the convenience of being able to travel with <NUM> books and at a time
i also have some music loaded on my nook so i can listed to it while i read
lastly , i am glad i bought a case for it because i pretty much take it every place i go so the hard case prevents the screen from getting scratched or broken
i am very happy with my purchase .
i loved using this nook reader
the bottom touch screen made navigation very convenient , and the reading screen was also very nice
we are now switching to the nook that just came out
yay ! : )
i have seen the kindle and wish i would have gotten it
the kindle was out of stock and i got the nook
the battery life is not good at all i can only get <NUM> pages at a time if i am lucky and on airplane mode
the kindle apparently will get you <NUM> times that ! if i had to do it again the kindle would be the way to go , but amazon lost a sale and was out of stock .
i bought this used and the person or company i bought it from didn not have the common sense to it from the previous owner
that should be done before you sell it
no excuse .
bought this for my wife a couple months ago and it is great ! i bought it over a kindle because of issues i researched about amazons' proprietary ebook formats and to get library books or other epubs you had to do some conversion to get them to work on the kindle
i wanted the easiest thing for my wife to deal with and the nook is great - had a couple ebooks ( from borders
com and barnes and noble ) downloaded and library books the first night ! just need a free download to manage the books from adobe and your set
its easy to navigate , batteries last about a month and my wife uses it every day
buy it !
i bought this on the 27th of december after hassling with fedex ( to the point where i made them just hold it at a fedex office ) <NUM> days later i finally have it after ( it was attempted for delivery on friday 1/6 ) i was pleasently surprised to discover how small this thing is
i have watched a ton of reviews and unboxing a on it and i guess the camera angles made it look wider
it is so tiny it can fit in a larger pocket ( like pajama pockets )
i already have <NUM> books and i actually finished one just now i started reading it at 1 : 30pm and it is 11 : 45pm i say not bad the book was <NUM> pages too
once i got the hang of it i was very pleased with my purchase and i recommend probably just getting the nook simple touch but coming down to reading it doesn not matter just read people ! that is a little rant
so i will maybe give another in depth review of this in a week
see you soon , thanks for reading my review .
when i first heard about readers , i was skeptical and did not want to give up my precious collection of books
( i have a teeny tiny little hoarder of books inside of me ! ) but then i finally caved and decided to try one because of my difficulty in reading larger and heavier books laying in bed at night , and due to being away from home for periods of time where i couldn not easily carry a dozen books with me
the first reader i had experience with was when my grandpa had purchased one of those huge honkin' kindle ds readers with the full key pad
i was excited about that one , but the price was way out of range
i decided to try and go with the nook ( after my typical ritual of spending days doing research on the best option ) and i was so thrilled with it , i had nothing bad to say
i used that little beauty for a few good years , until i was forced to sell it to help pay bills
from the very moment the nook left my hands i regretted it
i was certain i'd never find one that good again
and i don not believe there has been any readers since then that are that good still ! to this black friday
the first black friday when i actually have some money to spend ! and i am looking for a really good ! i did come across the nook on amazon , and saw the new nook simple touch , which intrigued me , because i wanted to stick with the display , and not have a touch screen battery killer
finally , i realized my love for the original nook had never died , and it still had everything i could ever want in an reader
i was even able to buy one from a vendor here on amazon , who lived less than half an hour away from me , and it only cost me $50 ! i was sooooo excited ! now , if only i had not wasted $5 on that stupid black cover , that completely ruined the casing on my nook
: (
high points : -easy to read the physical page turning keys on either side ( wish the nookcolor had this feature ) -size ( can hold it easily in one hand ) -lots of free classic books and classic books available for <NUM> transfer books from your library from device to device ( any nook device or device with a nook app ) -very organized library ( and easy to pick up where you left off no matter how long the nook has been turned off ) -beautiful design & feels very sturdy and well life ( charge lasts about <NUM> days if you have it on with the internet off for a few hours better than the nookcolor which gets about <NUM> days with comparable usage ) -elend compatible with your local library if they offer that feature ( which is the only reason i chose this over the kindle ) -free updates ( as the software improves , you won not have to buy a new device to get the upgrades , like faster page turning , better internet experience , etc ) -free ebook fridays via the barnes & noble storelower points : -delay between turning the page ( not a deal breaker by any means but there is a flash everytime you turn the page , which i personally don not like ) -weight ( you get used to it , but it could be lighter ) -browsing the internet and playing games via the tiny touchscreen is cumbersome
not to mention the internet function is quite basic and everything is of course in einkconclusion : if you don not have to have a color screen or a touchscreen and just want an ereader , i think this is a great choice
i love some of the features on this and think they should have been on the nookcolor
i definitely read a lot more books now and it is easy to take with me everywhere i go .
i bought this device not expecting much out of it
reading books is a breeze
the screen is clear even in bright light
the device is very light
feels like holding a small clipboard
i find myself touching the reading part of the screen
just a bad habit as i am used to using my iphone
as with any device , you might want to breeze thru the manual first because i sure didn not
took me a while to figure out that the "n" on the front is the "home" key
the craftsmanship feels pretty low end
i think if for some reason it fell out my hand , it would definitely break
i have never dropped it
that is just my opinion
battery life is good
tho using the wifi decreases the battery life a lot faster
though this can browse the net , don not even think about having a good experience doing that
the browser sucks
keep in mind , this is not a computer , nor a pocket pc/tablet pc
so if you are looking for something to browse the net , you should buy something else
on a whole , i find the device to be a little slow , but great for what it is intended for
it probably "turns" the pages as fast as you would turn the page of a real book
i am already used to fast devices , so that is probably why this seems slow to me
*international buyers*this device will download books if you are outside the us , however , you need to have a credit card that was issued from the us to purchase the books
i even tried purchasing an egift card from barnes and nobles and using that to purchase my books , and even though i was successful in purchasing the gift card , it will check your default credit card prior to deducting credit from your gift card
i ended up having to change the name on the account to my mom is name and used her credit card to purchase books
( she lives in the us )
amazon is missing big by not supporting library ebooks on its kindle ! i would have bought kindle , since i prefer a physical keyboard , better battery life and lighter weight of the kindle ( plus a marginally better processing speed and eink technology ) , but since my two library systems i belong to contain thousands upon thousands of digital books that i can borrow for <NUM> days at a time , buying the nook was a ! i am cheapskate , so i very rarely buy a book - instead i borrow them from the library
occasionally though i need to buy a book that is not available in the library at all , or in a digital format , or i need it for more than <NUM> days ( as when i travel overseas ) , so i end up just buying two digital books from barnes and noble for my nook
had amazon not been so afraid of loosing sales by supporting library digital books ( a groundless fear imo ) , i would have bought those two books from amazon for my kindle , instead of from their underdog competitor barnes and noble !
i received the nook as a christmas present
i already own a kindle latest generations , 3g/wifi
however i soon discovered that not all books are available on the kindle and <PERCENT> of the books i couldn not get on my kindle are on nook
after much research i soon learned that if you want good ebook reader you buy either a kindle or a nook
so i asked santa for it
i will not tell you i like the nook better than my kindle or my kindle better than my nook
both have excellent features that make them both excellent ereaders
here is a few on the nook : 1- it keeps the book title , time , and battery charge visible while reading
starts up just a bit faster than the kindle
can use your own photos for the screen saver and wallpaper
recognizes the table of contents in pdf books
reads epub file types ( meaning you can buy books from borders
com too and read them ) as for the kindle here are a few features i love about it : like the real keyboard as the buttons are much easier to push than on screen
reads pdfs much better than the nook , more so when you have the pdf converted
page turns are a bit faster
prefer the black housing to white
reading page/screen has no glare at all ( the nook is little color panel on the bottom is very reflective ) and it seems the print is a little darker
both the nook and kindle are very easy to purchase and load books on
i think the thing i was most disappointed in with the nook are the covers
they are not enough covers that actually close , like the kindle and when sticking this reader into your purse or bag , you don not want the cover to open and scratch the screen/reading surface
if you are looking for a great ereader , you cannot go wrong with this nook or the kindle latest generation , in my book they are both on the top shelf
now if we could just get one that is a smashed together version of both their great features into one unit
update : after using both my nook and kindle for a while now i have decided i do like the kindle much better than the nook
the page turning buttons on the kindle are very very light touch , the reading screen does have darker print , and the collections feature is top notch
now my nook , the buttons take some pushing to turn the pages , the reading screen is lighter , and the shelves option is ok
what i don not care for in the shelves feature is i can not colapse the shelves to just show the shelves and then open them when i want to search in them
i also don not care for the b&n ; library being seperate from my documents
on the kindle these are all included together and you can sort them out using collections
with the nook you must use the naviation screen to switch between them
i have also had some trouble with the navigation screen on the bottom
i don not have large fingers and don not wear long fingernails so moving around on the screen should be easy
however , when i am tryting to scroll or select something on the touch screen i just can not seem to get what i want
but when i don not mean to move on the touch screen but accidently touch it , i trigger a menu move
it is still a very good reader , but when comparing options and usability , i'd choose the kindle any day over the nook
i will purchase most of my books on the kindle and what isn not kindlized will go on the nook .
i ordered this product and it was not what i wanted
i ordered the wrong one
i contacted the company and returned the item with no problems
i ordered and new one from the same company and cannot wait to get it ! thanks !
very good product overall
manipulation is somewhat clumbersome , but after use for a few hours , it is ok
i understand that the new version ( color ) fixes these issues
the display really does give the feel of paper
only negative is no backlighting for use in very low to no light conditions
overall love the product .
i have been an amazon fan for a long time
my first attempt at owning a kindle resulted in two failing devices for which i eventually obtained a refund
my birthday is today ; my brother asked me what i wanted two weeks ago and i told him the kindle
unfortunately at that precise moment amazon was right in the middle of rolling out the new only kindle and all models were unavailable
so , i went for the barnes & noble nook only
considering my previous experience with the kindle , i tried not to get too excited
i went on the net to read reviews of the nook and was fearful
i read that it was buggy , that it lagged when you changed pages , that the touch interface was not all that responsive
all of this was wrong ; the page turns are quick and do not interrupt the flow of reading
the touch interface is very nice and i like seeing my book covers in color
when you choose the cover flow , your books slide by with the touch of a finger and you simply tap on the book you want to read at that moment
this was surprisingly helpful when i went to make purchases on the b&n ; store
i know you don not judge a book by its cover , but how many times has a nice colorful packaging led me to a book i wanted to read , uhm ; many times
i was really intrigued with the "swipe" page turn that you used the touch screen for , however this did not seem to function correctly on the store model or on my own nook
strangely , after a period of time , it now works perfectly
a representative told me it simply had to adapt to my touch
i don not know how much i trust that statement , however when she turned a page on the display nook it responded to her very well
( perhaps it was a learning curve ? ) documents : wow , if you have any epub or pdf documents all you have to do is side load them and voila
i do recommend a free program called calibre , which organizes your books , helps you edit the tags , add a color cover , or convert to epub
pdf is not very easy to read on the nook , but if you convert to epub it goes smoothly , unless there are alot of photos or images , which lessens the accuracy of the conversion
calibre has even converted files like , , html , palm , etc
calibre will let you pick and choose books to upload to the nook directly from the program ; in other words it isees' the nook
drawbacks to the nook : the battery life , that nifty little color touch screen eats the battery power like mad
b&n ; claim that you get <NUM> days , cut that in half
i do not know if this is because i use the touch screen to do my page turns or not , ( the other option being the side buttons ) but i am leaning toward , maybe ? lcd screens notoriously use power ; but using the page turn function does not require the to be on , so i am not sure how it is eating up the battery so badly
it is honestly not that much of a problem for me
i am around my computer so much that it is unlikely a day will go by without it being attached to the cpu or an outlet next to my bed
i have gone almost four days with not ; and i could see that little power icon decrease at least to slightly more than half in that time
oh - and that nifty little cover flow on the color screen
don not expect it to work for your documents
( there are two libraries , the b&n ; purchased books and your books or documents
) also there is no way to sort your documents to your specification so you either sort by author , title , or the date you loaded them , very annoying if you build up a nice library ; which is highly likely considering you can add an sd card to your nook and increase memory to <NUM> maybe <NUM> gigabytes
speaking of which with that ability to increase memory , it would have been nice if the mp3 player interface were a little more sophisticated
an interesting ability is to play an unabridged and read the book at the same time
i am not sure who would do that , but then again i understand spoken spanish more than i am capable of reading it
this might be useful to me in that area , if i can find the matching /
( nuance in foreign language is often lost in english translation
) never having owned a functioning 3g , i never really missed it with my home
i have discovered several places close to where i "haunt" which have at&t ; free to my nook
i already have a huge collection of books lined up for me to read
so feeling a "need" for the 3g seems unlikely
i have always done this , collected books that line up , ready for me to read
( by the way
the in store b&n ; connection has s*cked at every b&n ; store i have been to
amazingly border is free worked better , i just couldn not buy through the b&n ; store
i had to go to my smart phone , buy the book , and it uploaded
) so how do i feel about my nook ; i absolutely love it ! to be fair however , had i received a functioning kindle , i would have felt the same way about it , i am certain
i think the kindle has deficiencies with the lack of a touch/color interface and the side loading documents ability
however , that screen kills the battery as i stated
the reason for liking the separate touch interface is that you don not want to touch your screen ; i don not see how sony is all touch interface is going to be popular when you are smudging your read screen all the time , though i must admit i would like to try one out
the nook is comfortable in all sorts of positions , laying in bed , on the couch , holding it next to you ; even laying it away from you and increasing the font so that you could read without holding it
i highly recommend a reading light , especially if you had grown accustomed to reading lcd screens in the dark ( my kindle program on my android phone
) it is rather frustrating , i would have preferred a kindle simply because i was impressed with amazon customer service when my kindle malfunctioned
i do recommend the nook
it would be nice if they would lessen drm restrictions so i could buy books from amazon or any other place for that matter
first off , i want to start out by saying that i love my nook
my friend is an employee of b&n ; so he was there to help guide me along in my selection and answer any questions i had
so , yes , i did have a little bias to the product to begin with
however , for what i need , this is perfect in almost every single way
in my review i will compare the nook to the kindle ( $139 version ) and it is major differences , just so people know what i am talking about in terms of other products as we go down the list
the bad ( if you want to call it that ) : 1
the nook is a little heavier than the kindle
i am not sure of the exact weight differences , but just by feel alone it is a tad bit heavier
now , that can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it
i for one don not find it to be a deal buster , the weight is not catastrophically heavier and uncomfortable , but it is heavier than the kindle
i do think , however , that the durability of the nook is a little better compared to the kindle
the nook has built in paddles to turn the pages , while the kindle has flappy paddles along the side that feel as though they could break if i dropped it on it is side or if i touched it to hard
my suggestion for anyone interested in buying the nook is to also buy a carrying case for it so it makes it easier to read , almost as if you were reading a real book
the covers at b&n ; usually start around $30
the nook does have a touch screen that has a bit of glare to it
some others have posted their reviews of how they dislike the glare when the touch screen goes dark
for me it is a bit distracting if you find yourself wandering away from the text
however , whenever i read a book i find many distractions around me while i read
it is not a huge deal in anyway and some have posted if you turn it to the right angle you won not see your reflection
again , not a deal buster in anyway i wouldn not think
the start up time is atrocious
i can not defend this one in anyway
amish people can put up houses in a faster amount of time before the nook would have a chance to get to your homepage
ok , so not quite that slow , but you get the idea
i haven not timed it yet but i am going to take an educated guess that it takes around /2 minutes to start up
that is something that should have been addressed from b&n ; to begin with
again , i can not defend this one in anyway
ok , so what you have all been waiting for : the good1
the extra storage feature is superb
the nook comes with a built in 2gb storage space
enough for most people , 2gb will get most every book you want to read in your nook with no problem
however , if you are a fanatic reader that has newspapers and magazines delivered to your nook everyday or every week , this can begin to take up space if you don not free it up
but don not fret ! the nook comes with an extra storage slot for your sd card that can hold up to whatever the highest sd card space is out there
the great thing about it is , sd cards are a lot cheaper today than you would have found <NUM> years ago , so adding space is cheap
the nook has a featured called "lendme"
this is something that the kindle does not have and i am sure for competition sake will have in the future
this a great , great , great feature to the nook ! if you have any friends , family or that have a nook and have a book on theirs that you would like to read , you can hook up wireless or through the computer and lend them a copy of it for up to <NUM> days
if you are a fast reader then you can knock out a page book in easily <NUM> days
your county library might be on the list of nook rentals
in the county in which i reside in north carolina , our county library is fortunate enough to have a system in which i can rent books for <NUM> days from the library
this also is something the kindle does not have
before i go off on how great the feature for renting books is , i should point out that the library is going to have a limited selection of books for you to rent
i am a big thomas sowell reader and he has approximately <NUM> books out on the market
however , the county library that i rent from has only <NUM> book from his selection
so do you are research before you buy a book , your county library might have it already
the feature , as i have seen , is relatively easy to use
you do have to hard wire your nook to your computer after you download some software , but it is really simple and the kind people at your local county library can assist you on how to do this
in fact our county library had everything we needed in terms of software and directions on their website
you can take your nook to b&n ; and read any book for up to an hour
recently i went to grab some coffee at b&n ; and wanted to read a book on ireland
popped open my nook , connected to the b&n ; network ( already programmed into your nook for ease ) , selected the book i wanted to read from the list i searched on , and i was reading a book
you can read lots of books on one nook from their online selection without having to lug <NUM> actual books that you wanted to compare before you bought
in closing on this review i would say first and foremost do your homework
go to b&n ; or bestbuy and try out the kindle , nook and even the sony reader
some will really like the touch screen of the nook compared to the touchpad of the kindle , but it is all in what you like
some will like the fact you can lend books and some won not
i am sure i have missed out on something that others would like to know about the product before buying , so if you have any questions please contact me back here on amazon and i will try to get to you as quickly as possible .
in my honest opinion nook is unfinished product
none of my technical books in pdf format i was able to read due to pdf reader rendering formulas all over the screen with font
i am able to see formulas in small font but then the rest of text is unreadable
formula rendering in medium font is a mess however text is readable
i would have expected developer of the device spent more time on the text rendering on ebook reader .
with these new ereaders on the market , the act of reading has come back to be a very " , " technologically advanced and hip thing to do in 2010
books are now less intimidating and more fun and convenient , and this becomes only more encouraged through barnes and noble is nook
now , to cut to the chase , the nook can do most things that the amazon kindle can do as well , and while the kindle holds some ground over the nook , on an overall scale , if you are looking for a better and more convenient ereader , i'd say to go for the nook
both the kindle and nook have clear displays , but overall , i would say that the kindle is display seems to have better resolution
the kindle also beats the nook on battery life ( as you will notice that the nooks battery life seems to last about a week , whereas the kindle about a month , this is due to the draining power of the nook is touch screen menu )
people may also prefer the button keyboard operation of the kindle over the nooks sometimes annoyingly sensitive or touch screen
the kindle is also thinner and lighter than the nook
both have mp3 features though , which helps them
it is always great to be able to read to your favorite music
now , while it may seem in this paragraph the kindle has the nook easily beaten , one must look deeper into finding out why the nook is a better choice
the reason the nook beats the kindle is easy - in its navigation , presentation and overall ease of use
the biggest problem with the kindle ( that i noticed ) is that the kindle seems to want to have the look and feel of navigating like a laptop computer in the way it presents the main menu and font size , style and book selection
the problem with this is one thing - this is not a computer , it is a portable book , and barnes and noble knows this , and made their unit feel way less like just another annoying technological gadget but instead with a "browsing bookstore" type of presentation
this is a very big difference between the two , and you can sense it even after just a few minutes of toying with it
and this is only talking about the older nook , i can only imagine how much more amazing of a presentation the color nook can get with all of its full color pictures and extras
on top of this , the kindle seems to have placed the buttons way too attached to the ends , so you actually end up hitting the buttons by accident way too often , whereas the nooks buttons are more of a soft "bendable plastic" type , so you never hit them by accident
this , on top of the little things like being able to slide your finger on the touch screen to turn pages as well as getting book covers and previews , daily logs , etc , give the nook an overall more "coffee house" feel which the kindle doesn not even come close to
and even though the nook is bulkier and heavier , it actually is made of a more durable softer material , and along with the white paneling it makes it feel overall way more professional and studious
not to mention just more attractive and stylish
this is easily the hipper of the two ereaders
therefore , things like slightly longer load times , heavier feel , sometimes annoying touch screen and slightly higher price are actually very tolerable once you pick up both units and see and feel the overall difference
books are an type of entertainment , and while the kindle tries to make reading and literature just another tacked on 21st century technological piece of unrelatable modernized hardware , the nook walks the perfect line of bringing the "" hobby of reading to a hipper style for the 21st century without taking away the studious professionalism of reading or disrespect the art of literature either
the transition is so much smoother on the nook that you will forget you are even reading off of an electronic device .
this is a pretty nice looking toy but useless for any real application
no matter how hard i try i just can not force myself to try and read a book on the little 3" by 5" screen
the display is small , dim and has poor contrast so it is hard to read unless it is in bright sunlight and pictures on a page are too small to see clearly
it won not play very many types of books besides pdf files and kindle books are not compatible
also it goes to sleep if you don not keep constantly moving your finger around on it
also it is supposed to be able to browse the web but the web function doesn not do anything but show a picture of a web page that talks about it is features but if that did work it would be useless since there is no mouse and no way to move around on the page
it can play mp3 is that sound ok but it is 100 is of times bigger than an ipod and too large to carry around .
i went from the sony reader pocket edition ( which i really did like ) to the nook after the wifi only version came out and i do not regret the move
i love everything about the nook and bn reader store
the nook is bigger than the sony pocket reader and after reading the nook for awhile - i just could not go back to reading something on the pocket reader
i like the fact that you can enlarge the print up to extra extra large and choose between several font styles
i like the clock at the top of the reader so now i don not have to waste my morning reading time on the porch by constantly running in to check the clock in the kitchen to see when i need to get ready for work
i like the fact that you can look at the covers of the books when you want to pick out what you want to read next
i like that you can add so much extra space to your device ( the pocket reader only accepted <NUM> books before freezing and acting up )
i really like the fact that you can preorder ebooks which will just download to your device when they are available
i like the fact that the power cord is $14
99 so i can buy extra ( one for home , one for work ) - where sony reader is power cord was almost $30
i like the fact that i can install my own new battery when the time comes and not have to send my reader off to have it done for me
i like the fact that if there are any questions about the nook , i just have to go to a nearby b&n and get the help i need instead of wasting time with emails only to receive vague answers from the techs
all in all i think this is a wonderful device - exactly what i wanted
i usually read about three to four books a week and being able to carry my whole library with me is great ! i would definitely recommend this product .
sorry kindle , but the nook is my book
i studied the various ereaders and tablets trying to decide what to spend my money on
loved the idea of an ipad , but $600 is ridiculous for books , and it is size prohibits simple everyday usage
android tablets seem too fickle and the technology is changing daily , without being upgradeable
so that leaves dedicated ereaders
kindle was out for two main reasons : proprietary file format prohibits library rentals , and removable battery
the nook just seemed the right set of features .
my wife received a basic nook for christmas
being electronically challenged , she immediately plopped it in my lap with instructions to "buy me a book"
as the nearest b&n ; store is <NUM> miles away i elected to follow the b&n ; site to my pc , to the nook route
opening an account on the b&n ; site , purchasing a book and downloading it to my pc was easy and fast
prices are about half that of a printed version
passing it along to the nook was another matter
the nook came with virtually no usable instructions , either printed or electronic , to explain the procedure that i wanted to use
after going back to the b&n ; site i discovered a little free program called "nook for pc"
after downloading that program i was able to copy the book from my pc to the nook
everything works fine now , and my wife is addicted to the thing , she takes it everywhere
she still will not , however , try to load new purchases on the nook
we now have three copies of every book we have purchased , one on the b&n ; site , one on my computer , and one on the nook
with one nook , it is pretty hard to share after she finishes , and although i can read the books on my pc , that just is not comfortable or practical
i personally think $150 or so for my own nook might be a little too much so i am going to look into a cheaper alternative
walmart has one or two for under $120 , one for under $90 that some people like
the nook is a good option if all you want is a book reader
the other functions do not seem to work well enough to be practical
the nook might be a little expensive for what you get , but the service at the b&n ; store we visited twice was excellent
one evening after dinner we visited a b&n ; store with nook in tow
after my wife found a book she wanted , we took the book and the nook to the nook counter
the attendant was happy to purchase the book with her nook and download it for her
the book cost for $24 and change , downloaded to the nook , $12 and change
he even offered to return the book to the proper place on the shelf
not saying they will do this all the time , but it was a nice experience , and we saved a little money .
the battery is hours from <PERCENT> charged
i was wondering how i would like an vers a book , and i must say that i don not even notice the difference
love everything about it
the only thing that could be better is the on/off function and
the power button is very sensistive and is tricky to turn on ( at first )
the ewifi range is short
maybe <NUM> ft from my router is all i can go
other than that
it works great , and at a very fair price
not worth saving a few bucks
go with an ipad .
an ereader without ? really ? ereaders are devices dedicated to reading , and thus the main inconvenience they should avoid is
by introducing a backlit ebook , b&n ; removed the key point of ereaders
if you need a device that has a backlit screen ( and can afford a $283 device ) , why wouldn not you pay the extra $200 to get an ipad , which does the job much more efficiently ? please , correct me if i am wrong , because i really don not get the point of this device
thanks .
i knew about the nook color even before it was released and i was really excited about this ereader , because i own a kindle <NUM> and i am part of the customers that think that it could offer more things and be more en par with the future
the nook color has many features that appealed to me like touchscreen , vivid view technology , brightness adjustments , really nice web browser and mp3 player , etc
so i decided to order one with blueproton cause they ship it to canada , and i paid <NUM> dollars more than the actual price at b&n ; and expedited shipping taxes on top of that
i didn not care , i just wanted my nc cause honestly i am just tired of buying aaa batteries for my clip light to read my kindle <NUM> in bed
i noticed i never read in bright sunlight , i am an indoors type of reader and i also like to browse while i read , mostly wikipedia and google and the kindle we browser is primitive
anyways , i got the nc promptly , i was super excited , but then i tried to transfer my epub books to it and noticed that my computer didn not recognize the unit is drive
nothing popped
i had my iphone and my kindle plugged in and they were right there
i went to a friend is house and nothing popped on his computer either
a third try at a different laptop and same thing : nada
i went back home and kept trying and all of a sudden i started seeing smoke coming out of the usb port and a smell of burned toast
really strong
i knew that unit was gone and that freaked me out
everything else worked perfectly , but the usb was pooched
i returned it and they were very professional about it , but said that they found nothing wrong with the device
i bet they just reset it and tested ome of the features without actually testing its hardware
anyways , i said i didn not want that unit back
now here i am , with no nook color , nobody else sends it to canada
i am contacting friends in the us so i can send it to them , buying it straight from b&n ; and then they can mail it to me
it is just weird that at this day and age we still can not have items shipped internationally , even when we are willing to pay more money for that luxury
now i am again using my kindle like crazy , since it is all i got and it never fails
but i am still gonna buy the nc no matter what
i just don not know if i will sell my kindle <NUM> in the future or keep it because it has sentimental value now , hehe
i think that for <NUM> us dollars , the nc is the best in the market
right now the kindle still leads and the ipad is coming strong , but <NUM> will be the year the nook color will establish itself as a great competitor for these other two
if amazon doesn not come up with a color kindle with touchscreen , i strongly believe they will be the betamax and vhs of the 2000s
but i really like the kindle and if they came up with something like a reader is tablet , i would use it instead of using b&n ; is
however , that still hasn not happened and jeff bezos says he doesn not want that to happen just now
so i will purchase a nook color and be happy with it .
my daughter wanted one of these for a while and after "all her friends" got them for christmas we bought her one
she uses it all the time and reads so much more now then before
i hate having to pay for books she could just get from the library but our library now offers free books for the nook that you can check out digitally for <NUM> weeks with no fees
now we get all sorts of books for it for free
so happy with our purchase .
i bought the color nook for a family member for christmas
if i didn not already have the ipad and prefer apple products , i would have purchased one of these for myself
i think it makes a much more user friendly product than android tablets , and the price is good
combine a good product at a great price with an already large library available from barnes & noble , and you have a real competitor to the ipad and kindle .
i have been working on my fiction writing skills , and wanted an ebook reader so that i could read a variety of other novels to learn from them
the kindle is a great device , but i really wanted a color screen
the ipad would have been a nice option , but was a bit expensive for my taste and a bit too large
the myriad android tablets on the market don not seem to get great reviews , though i suspect that will start to change once android 3
0 is available
the nook color was a nice alternative
priced a little higher than some of the asian tablets , but far less than the ipad
it supports , has a decent color display , and the ability to insert micro sd cards into a slot near the "loop" on the bottom
because it supports both epub and pdf out of the box , you can find a nice selection of books to download ( legally ) on the web and read on the device without additional investment
the barnes and noble site also offers a limited , but growing , selection of electronic books ( both free and )
if you get tired of reading , you can use the wifi and browser to surf the web
you can also play a couple of the games , with the promise of more coming in a future update from barnes and noble
my only complaints so far about the device are that the far edges of the touchscreen seem a little unresponsive , the connector is a type that seems to require use of the proprietary cable
the connector on the device itself seems to make poor contact with that cable , which makes it difficult or impossible to read on the device while it is charging
apart from that , battery life has been really good
i rarely have to plug it in before i am finished reading for the day
the web browser works well , displaying pretty much any web site that an ipad or android phone can handle
the wifi seems to find and hold on to signals well , and i don not recall it dropping a connection so far
if you take the time to learn how to "root" the device , you can add the android market to it and many apps ( like the kindle app ) work very nicely on it
this gives you the best of both worlds in a sense
the ability to buy ebooks from amazon and barnes and noble , while keeping your color display
as far as eye strain goes , i work at computers <NUM> or more hours a day on the job and more when i get home
i find the nook is display easy to read for hours at a time and don not feel that my eyes are any more strained than when i read a printed paper book
but your mileage may vary
if works better for you , the kindle is a great alternative
i like the ability to highlight parts of the books i am reading , take notes inside the book as i read ( e
, to highlight particularly good dialogue , characterization , description , etc
, as a writer ) , and to post updates to twitter and facebook about your progress through a book
all in all , this was my favorite <NUM> christmas gift and has ( for me ) eliminated any desire to own an ipad or any other ebook reader .
i have had my new nook color for about <NUM> hours so here are my early impressions : pro : good quality , good color , responsive to light touch , connects easily to wifi , good email service , easy access to barnes & noble ebooks
very b & n friendly
very good battery charge life
con : lousy quick setup guide ( more like an advertisement ) , only responds to finger touch ( i prefer a screen that accepts stylus touch
i have large hands and fingers )
lousy speakers ( but i expected that ) i haven not been able to download movies from netflix , i will keep working on that
connection to netflix was the main reason for buying the nook color
difficult to download other products
no night time screen
on line manual ( >100 pages ) is almost useless
this is my second tablet in the last month
the first was a pandigital novel which i returned because it was an android 2
0 and had limited capabilities and no access to netflix
and terrible customer service ( none )
there is a b & n store <NUM> minutes from whre i live
in the past i have spoken to the folks there and they seem very knowledgeable
i will visit them again with my list of questions
i will do an update to this in a couple of weeks
raised my rating to a <NUM> *
i found out i needed to do a software update ( from 1
3 to 1
1 ) in order to get netflix
the nice man at the b & n store did this for me in about <NUM> minutes
i now get netflix with very good reception
at this time i really don not care about additional apps
everything i think i will ever want is in the nook color now
in and out
downloads books from the public library in seconds
internet browsing ok
ebay access is ok
bought a game for $0
99 just to check out my b & n account
netflix was easy to set up
battery charge lasts longer than anticpated
the software upgrade has made the device overall more user friendly
the only complaint i still have is that i can not use a stylus
maybe i can exchange my fingers for a smaller set
not sorry i bought this gadget
also , good quality and great customer support .
i didn not buy this to be an e reader but as a small tablet pc , and i was rather surprised with how well it works
i am using it much more than i thought i would
most of the time i use an aftermarket android os ( cyanogenmod ) booting off a micro sd , there is no need to root or jail break the stock firmware to do this
with the aftermarket firmware , it also has bluetooth , the micro usb can be used as a host usb with an adapter or usb gender changer , and it will charge the battery while plugged in to a pc is usb , normally it will only charge with the wall charger
my biggest complaint with the stock firmware is b&n ; is app store , the apps are fairly pricey , apps that are free elsewhere you have to pay for , there are a few free apps from b&n ; but not many
with the aftermarket firmware i am using the amazon app market , much better selection and prices
cons : the sound is about what i expected , fairly poor , but is greatly improved by using an amplified external speaker
the micro sd slot is in a very poor location making it very difficult to insert and remove , it is located under a hinged cover behind the loop in the lower left corner , it is well protected there , just not easy to access
don not expect to watch streamed hd video , however , sites like youtube work fine
despite the cons , i give <NUM> stars , i think it is a great value , i have been very pleased with it .
i bought this product used from a coworker is daughter who was phenomenally underwhelmed by it
it is heavy and slippery
the capacitive touch is not perfect , and the narrow metal rim of the screen ensures one ends up touching the screen and changing things inadvertently
there is only one option for a page turn ; lefties beware
the battery life is far shorter than the time necessary to read a medium length book , and the is at the bottom of the unit
since the cable is specific to the nc , i hated to risk bending/breaking it as i can imagine it is pricey to replace so plugging in the unit usually meant it was time to put the unit down for a long time while it recharged
i traveled with this unit , and it did not get me from one airport to the next on a charge
a lot of the ebooks i own are in
pdb format , which b&n sells , but the nc does not read
i was having problems with the unit not doing the motion and read thingy , and b&n pretty well ignored me
the local manager reminded me that used units are no longer subject to help
( the concept of the unit being less than <NUM> months old when it died , and turned on twice before i bought it , didn not bear any weight
) a local computer repair guy charged me $60 for absolutely no help at all ; apparently the nc is far too complicated for anyone but a b&n repair person which never bodes well
now the unit , fully charged , will not turn on at all ; again , no help at the forum
since for $40 more one can buy a viewsonic gtablet with 10" lcd screen , android os 2
2 and download reading apps for it , i'd say forget the nook color .
i bought it for my pdf library and to surf the net on the go
it turns out that it won not read /latin pdf documents , unless : a word document transformed into a pdf .
i have had the nook for less than <NUM> months
it is been ailing for at least <NUM> of those months
at first , it wouldn not start up for no apparent reason
i'd get crazy messages and images on the screen , but no access to function
i went online to see if other buyers had the same problems and possibly solutions
they did
lots of complaints and a few helpful suggestions
the things i had to try were a nuisance but they worked when i was persistent
i learned to fuss around and get the thing started
then the charger started failing
i'd have to position it a certain way and weight it down when it was attached to the nook
that worked for awhile
after awhile , it seemed clear that something was wrong with the connection so i bought a charger from amazon
good news
it worked
bad news
it worked for only a week
i called nook customer service
they said i really needed a barnes & noble brand charger
so i laid out another $15 or so
that charger worked for about <NUM> days
now the eeg for my nook has
no web advice and no customer service advice helps
however , in my last conversation with b&n ; , they told me to take it into a b&n ; bookstore and have them look at the device
this will be my last ditch effort
if further measures require an investment of more than <NUM> cents , i will tell them to pitch it in recycle
i wouldn not have hung in nearly as long if it hadn not been for a nook game i am addicted to and can get nowhere else
time for , i guess
i will never buy another nook
as my kids would say , it is a p* of s*
barbara cox
i purchased two certified nook colors directly from b&n ; , for my kids to read ebooks on , and for some entertainment on long trips , dr is appts , etc
things i like about the device : -versatility- now has netflix- great little device for entertainment , as well as reading
-user interface : much improved following the last update , both navigating the device itself and b&n ; is store
-option for expandable storage- handy for music and mp4 is
-ability to make the device 'kid friendly' ; the internet can be disabled , and purchases can be made to require your account password
things i dislike about the device : -read in store feature only for certain books , and virtually no kids' books
the impression i got from b&n ; is webpage was that it was for all ebooks
this was the main reason why i picked these up instead of waiting for the kindle fire to be released
major disappointment
-charger cable sucks
the cable itself is weak where the usb adapter attaches to the cable , and is very easy to bend and break
one cable is now broken at that spot , and the other is close to it
these cables are easily replaceable , so not a huge deal , but i expected better quality
also , the power adapter is quite bulky
-did not update automatically
i had to manually install the most recent update ( allowing me to disable internet , and install netflix )
it was relatively easy to do , following directions from b&n ; is webpage , but there should be a way to check for updates from the device itself
-loses battery life fairly quickly while on standby
-no free games & limited games ( maybe apple spoiled me
) -prices for apps and books seem generally higher than on my kindle ( i have not made direct comparisons , this is just my general impression ) i will try and see if i can lend books through my local library ; this may allow me to use it more for it is intended purpose
overall , the device itself is quite good- just not for what i had intended it for ( in store reading- with the option to purchase the book , in print , from the store )
if i had purchased the device for myself , however , it would have been returned
my kids do enjoy reading on it , playing angry birds , watching netflix , etc
so i will keep it for their use
edit : the nook colours use a usb longer than a standard micro usb ; a standard micro usb cable will not charge the nook colour
i did contact b&n ; ( i initially took my nooks into a b&n ; store for assistance , and was referred to their tech support number
so much for the in store tech support
) i was able to recieve two new cables under warranty , though
i am generally happy with the tech support provided over the phone , but am still disappointed by the quality of the charging cable , and the inability of b&n ; to solve this issue .
i am the occasional reader but , i bought this for tablet capability
it can be rooted in about <NUM> minutes to have app store
once that is done , you can use a home screen alternative and program to switch it to hide the overbearing and hindering b&n ; store
it is still there but , not right in my face
default browser is ok but , i prefer dolphin hd
it is much more than half and ipad at exactly half the price
plus , when used as a reader , it is just light and small enough to be effective at that purpose
i had a pandigital novel that i got for xmas that completely died in <NUM> weeks
i took the refund money and made the smartest purchase that i can remember making : the nook color
the novel is pure garbage compared to this device
android 2
1 is so much better than 1
i also couldn not get many apps to run on the novel where this runs almost everything
spend the extra $ and get the color
save the extra money from the ipad
i was considering archos <NUM> but , i couldn not find anywhere to actually play with it
plus , given their history ; i had decided against it
good : nice screen , capacitive touch , strong wifi , decent battery life , nice cpu @ <NUM> mhz , <NUM> mb ram ipad only has <NUM> supposedly ) , tons of free apps available , very reasonably priced , portable , barnes and noble magazines very reasonably priced at $1 to $3 an issue ) , microsd slot
bad minor complaints ) : that silly plastic thing in the corner , mono speaker , micorsd slot instead of sdhc card slot , doesn not come with android market
overall this is the best tablet for the money currently and probably will be for quite a while
couple of small annoyances : randomly reboots instead of sleeping , wireless doesn not come back up sometimes after rebooting
still very happy with it though
sleep issue apparently also happens to those who haven not rooted
i am sure it will be fixed with update
update : i am very unhappy with barnes and noble is many attempts to update my firmware without my permission
they have tried twice and didn not succeed
i believe that avg antivirus is stopping it
they got my girlfriend is and we have the same nook , that came with same firmware , that was flashed with same mod
the only thing i can think of was avg must have stopped it
they got hers weeks ago and mine is still fine
she wasn not running avg and mine was
it is the only thing i can think of
who else does that ? i have items from sony , microsoft , nintendo , htc ( sprint ) , etc and none of them update my property
who do these people think they are ? well , they won not be updating my firmware and now i won not be buying books from them either
anyway , it is an aging piece of hardware and now for a bit more money something better can be bought
side note : i had ordered a touchpad from b&n ; back on august 21st
not only did i not get one , they cancelled my order for me without so much as an email
not very nice .
when rooted , this is an amazing device , with a powerful cpu that can be over clocked past the normal over clock speed of <NUM> mhz and way past the typical <NUM> mhz speed with only less of a battery life and no other ill effects
you will have to download the typical angry birds and fruit ninja games as apk files , but when you do , this device will shine
other recommendations are tank hero , and jet car , and jest car lite ( the lite version has levels that the full version does not even have ! ) .
i have had my color nook for three months
its fine for reading but the kindle is cheaper and the nook is sure not a tablet , you cant get free apps , if you want an app from your tv station , guess what , if bn isnt selling it you cant get it , thats why they sell these things , so you have to buy from them
i found free ebooks on the web , and down load to my pc as pdf files and drag them to the nook
] is very good
the pages change size of their own freewill , which is very annoying , and the battery life is awful , if you use wifi you have to recharge every day
yahoo mail is awful on the nook , gmail is fine and hotmail is too
as far as the web , email is all it good for
i wish i had bought and archos tablet , all the things i am doing now plus a lot more .
i have had the opportunity to test both nook color and kindle fire
my favorite is the kindle fire
) poor customer service from barnes and noble - the cable breaks easily , and this device is not compatible for swaps
what i mean is like on the kindles you can basically switch out the cables for any micro usb cable
nook color you can not do that
once your nook color is out of warranty , they will no longer replace the cable , so if it breaks , your like sol until you buy another one for $19
95 + shipping + tax
the cable is really cheap and breaks to easily
i think each time i have had a new cable replaced i could only get it to last about uses before it broke
it keeps breaking at the n
) the updates are horrible
basically you will have lag issues and the battery will drain easy if you don not update
actually after a while the battery will just start draining anyways and you can not keep charge
) it takes forever to turn on
you have to wait like <NUM> minutes and keep holding the power button and then like another <NUM> minutes to boot up
with kindle it turns on almost instantly
after a while , you still have to wait about a minute for the kindle to boot up , but it still loads quicker than the nook color
) a feature i like is that the volume buttons are on the side
with kindle fire , you have to dig around to find them
they are in the settings
like you can only adjust the volume on kindle fire through the settings
) another feature i like is the card expansion slot
i like to store avi movies from my camcorder and what not on them , and you can not do that with the kindle fire
) check each stores content before you buy
each ereader loads different files
this is the main reason i bought both
most of my textbooks for school are only available through barnes and noble , but i prefer to read on the kindle
after i am done with school , i am going to be selling my nook color , but i refuse to get rid of my kindle fire , unless they update to one that has the volume buttons on the side , and plossibly a card expansion slot
for me , i actually found out that most of the content i liked was available through amazon for free , and it cost at b&n ; , so that may be another influence for when you decide to purchase
it is just i wish that amazon would just carry all the textbooks i need , so i don not have to keep going to b&n
; so , other than the software is a tiny bit easier to navigate around , i'd prefer kindle fire over nook any day
just because i get longer lasting supplies and better customer service .
the nookcolor is awesome- it plays music , is expandable , displays gorgeous color , allows you to surf the internet ( not optimally , but the ability is there ) , and is mostly easy to navigate
from me , it gets a solid <NUM> stars
the problem is that as an ereader , it is already overpriced , and the amazon sellers who offer it are asking ridiculous amounts
it is cheaper ( and ships free ) from barnes and noble
amazon is usually <HASHTAG> at everything , including price , and i already own two kindles ( i would buy the kindle in color if it came that way ) but the price being charged for the nookcolor on amazon is absurd .
i have held off on an reader for a long time
the kindle was always too expensive and , even now , i don not like the way the screen flashes when "turning" pages
after playing around with many different readers , over a period of several weeks , i finally decided to pick up a nook a couple of months ago
one of my big considerations is that i wanted to be able to read
pdf files in color
the nook easily satisfied that requirement
what i was expecting ; however , is how fantastic the nook is after android is installed on it
a friend of my just bought a new ipad <NUM> and showed it to me a couple of days ago
that , of course , is a wonderful device but very expensive
i started to look around the 'net and found that the latest android operating system , honeycomb , can be installed on a memory card and that this will allow the nook to run the new os
even better , by simply removed the card , the nook returns to it is normal state and continues to run as before
i had no idea how powerful the nook color really is until i installed honeycomb on it
the nook is now so great that it behooves me that b & n doesn not simply place android on the nook as the default os ! yes , it is its that good ! just one word of caution
as using honeycomb doesn not require that the nook be rooted , it is a bit tricky to install but that is only due to the horrible instructions that the geeks who discovered how to put android on the it
( as a rule , geeks are usually incapable of writing in languages
) i don not know if the warranty is voided by running honeycomb but , as all that needs to done to get rid of it , is remove the card , i suspect that no one will know
all in all , the nook color was already a great device but adding honeycomb makes it amazing !
i have never been a big fan of reading until i purchased the nook
i have trouble putting it down
i am either playing games or reading
absolutely love it .
i haven not really given up my kindle ( which i love and has its advantages )
however , i got a deal on a nook color that was impossible to ignore and so i made the jump
if you are wondering if it is worth 2x the price , imo it depends on your needs and wants
for people who want to create an inexpensive /android tablet by rooting the nook -- or if you love to read periodicals or books with lots of images -- the nook color is the way to go
it is surprisingly heavy to hold -- much heavier than my kindle with a cover
the battery life means you can not be far away from an electrical plugin
my last charge lasted 2+ days with playing games , an animated screensaver and some reading
it is also wireless only
the backlit lcd screen is spectacular and i find it was better on my eyes for reading than i expected
however , i find that finding ebooks on b&n ; is site is harder than amazon and i cannot find many inexpensive or the oodles of free ebooks like for kindle
lots of ebooks promoted on b&n ; is nookstore are $4
99 - $9
99 or more
too expensive , imo
seems like fewer indie authors on there in the $2
99 price range : ( i decided to take a chance and rooted my new nook color which requires a micro sd card ( i used a 2g card )
it requires the ability to follow some technical steps that took me about <NUM> minutes total
i am not a major geek , but i have been online for <NUM> years and know basic stuff like html ( not needed for this ) and moving files and some troubleshooting if i get stuck
the rooted nook is a bit quirky
while the original b&n ; functionality is still there , i had to install a couple apps ( launcher app and softkeys ) to toggle between the android and b&n ; screens
i can watch youtube and surf the web easily
i also downloaded the amazon kindle app to my rooted nook , and read my 100+ kindle books on it ( and get my freebies too ! )
you can not view flash or use hulu or netflix ( yet ! ) , but maybe flash will work with the next b&n ; update
note that a nook color doesn not have a mic or bluetooth to use with certain android apps
a bummer for me because i like to dictate texts and emails on my phone using nuance is flext9 app
overall , my kids *love* the android side of the rooted nook color , and i like getting some useful apps on a much bigger screen
so now we fight over it
will i get rid of my kindle -- no way
but i find the nook color becoming more my at home reader with the kindle app on it , and my kindle device turning into an away from home , travel .
i have had my nook for <NUM> months and the only issue i have had with it is the charger cord went bad , but i called the toll free number and they are sending me a new one for free
i am am lost without it ! i have an easy reader from nook , but this is so much better .
pros : 1 )
excellent color screen2 )
firmware update to android froyo 2
1 allows for minor expansion of capabilities3 )
responsive touch screen during reading4 )
good , sturdy construction5 )
exapandable memory with microsd card slot6 )
weight is slightly heavy , but not too bad at all
cons : 1 )
although it can play videos on the internet , videos are otherwise extremely hard to find that fit the format for the player
for example , amazon
com instant video plays
wmv files , which is not a compatible format
converting these files to another format is next to impossible , since amazon
com instant video doesn not support the nook color
com , cinemanow ( through best buy ) , and even itunes movies are all drm protected and won not run on the nook color due to lack of support ( trust me , i have tried them all )
2 )
not connected to android app store
barnes and noble currently ( as of 5/11/11 ) only has <NUM> apps in their "nook apps store"
overall : b+the color nook is a great with inernet capabilities and limited android apps
although a android firmware update was released in may 2011 , the limitations of the device can be seen through lack of impressive apps and extreme lack of "" video playback , put the color nook down a coulpe of notches in my book
overall though , this is an impressive for the novice user who is looking for a light travel device that can offer internet connectivity and decent battery life .
before i get started , i will just say that my review comes from the unit we got at the bookstore to display
the overall product will still be the same , but some things ( like the instruction manual ) might be different
---------reading : it is a nice clean picture & the backlit screen isn not too annoying , but i have a feeling that people will be feeling the eyestrain later
if you are looking to buy this for reading at length , you will need to be aware of this
you can change the brightness of the page , but that doesn not change that ultimately you are still looking at a backlit screen
downloading : pretty fast download times , although i only downloaded the free samples from the storefront
( hilarious since i work at a & the storefront is b&n
; we are so going to lose money on ebook sales
) internet : pretty decent
i pulled up facebook & the page is crisp , clear & loads quickly
i also went onto failblog , a site with quite a few side ads
it was a little on the slow side , but that is to be expected on stuff like this
you can also pull up videos on youtube , so that is a bonus
battery : not bad , but obviously won not last as long as the nook or some of the units out there
you will get about hours if you leave the wifi on
not sure about the battery life right now , but since the company says it is <NUM> hours i'd say it is probably about hours
extras : you can change the font , screen background color , & a few other things
while that is nice , i couldn not help but feel a little underwhelmed by it
there is also the option to be able to toggle back & forth between the publisher default & your aesthetics of choice
you can also change the background on the main page of the nookcolor , which is a nice touch
since we are not supposed to change that with our store unit , i wasn not able to play with that any
touch screen : it is ok
pretty easy to use , but a few times i found myself really having to wrestle with it to turn pages
sometimes it would be too sensitive & i'd end up a few pages ahead of where i wanted to be
not a deal breaker , though
it didn not happen enough to where i'd get overly irritated , but people who are all thumbs with touch screens will be irritated
user friendly : it is not very intuitive to use
people savvy with & gadgets will be able to figure it out pretty quickly but people who are new to the scene will be pretty confused with everything
the unit for my store didn not come with any written directions- it was all on the unit
that means that if it is like this on the sale unit then that won not be all that helpful for the people who aren not able to navigate well on the unit
overall : my opinion is that it is ok , but not exceptionally so
go for the ipad if you really want something like this
( i know it is more expensive , but if you are willing to pay $300 then paying $500 might not be that much of a difference
) it is basically a nook/ipad hybrid , but without the option for all of the extras & apps
( of course if all you want is an & wouldn not use the ipad is extras , then this is great
) overall it isn not a bad unit but it just doesn not have anything to really make it stand out
if you are a big fan of the nook then go for this unit , but i'd play with it in the store first
the only two things that really make this stand out from the other on the market is that the unit is in color and that the internet on this unit is far better than some of the other options on the market
while the color option is great for children is books & magazines , this might not be enough for users who predominantly use their readers for plain print reading & that the ones who would want these things might already have it in the various tablets that are on the market
i did enjoy playing with the unit in my store , but i don not know that i would choose it over the regular nook
of course this is just my opinion , but again- before making a big purchase like this , view a unit in the store first
i will admit , i bought it to hack it
if you have no interest in hacking this device , then let me start with the "stock" review first
as an ebook reader , it is very good but not great
eink and its variants will always be the gold standard by which you measure a reading device , because the utility of such a display in daylight is unrivaled
my hope is that in time , the pixel qi displays make their way into kindles , nooks , ipads , etc on such a large scale that this is no longer an issue
alas , it remains one , and it is a key criterion for many
as an lcd touch screen , it is very bright and colors are rich , not saturated
touch sensitivity is a little rough , as is accuracy
i did not see a calibration function
wireless connectivity is very , very good but for some reason , will not connect with some routers
the range is impressive , better than my droid 2
speeds are very good , but i neglected a speedtest in this round
integration with the b&n ; store is very tight as expected
the store app for the nook is better than the android app , necessarily : you can browse magazines and newspapers , for one thing
display of media is and fairly intuitive ; i never cracked the user manual or quick start guide ( then again , i rarely do that for anything i buy )
prices are competitive with other vendors , and it does handle sideloading of books onto microsd cards
by the way , 32gb microsds are supported
i run with an 8gb , and i have filled it mostly with music
and oh by the way , it plays music very well
some of you might listen to music while you read , and i am one of those weirdos
this device , stock , will do just that
overall , i like this device , but would probably prefer eink if i was buying it solely for reading media
however , i bought it for cheap tablet use
in this regard , it has amazing potential
despite the fragmentation of custom rom and rooting options , you can indeed settle on a cyanogen rom and find a lot of functionality on the cheap
i can browse websites easily if i don not need flash ( currently not working on this rom ) ; i use pocketcloud to log into my home machines and i can work from there if needed
i'd love to have swype on this , or even graffiti , but it is sufficient to have access to the android marketplace and all the attendant apps i have stored in the cloud
there is no microphone or camera , so those apps have no place here , nor does gps exist
however , bluetooth is available in cyanogen nightlies so you can now try pairing it with headsets and keyboards
thus far , the potential is not fully realized but it perfectly suits my needs today
with time , this will become a great tablet once flash is fully operable and the honeycomb roms are fully baked
stock , <NUM> stars
hacked , <NUM> stars , tremendous value
first off , do not expect nook color to do wonders
it is not meant to be tablet or an ipad replacement
it is foremost an with some bells and whistles
if i am given a choice , i would not buy a nook
for the price , i would rather get a kindle fire
i own <NUM> laptops , <NUM> ipad <NUM> for my wife , and <NUM> kindle fires for my kids
nook color is an afterthought and it is for me
i bought my used nook color on another site for $114 ( free shipping ) <NUM> weeks ago
and it was a steal
the nook i received was in working order and it looked new
i had no trouble turning it on and everything worked perfectly
the only gripe was it was extremely slow compare to some of the tablets i own
again , i reminded myself that this is not a tablet so i had to be fair
the features are not too bad but the navigation was confusing at best
fast forward to today
b&n ; was smart to release an update ( 1
1 )
if you already own a nook color , you should get the update
the update improves the speed dramatically
the navigation still lacks finesse though
here are some of the goods- i bought it cheap- it has an expansion slot
i inserted a 16gb micro sd card and nook recognizes it right away
- the web works fine
it can now even watch some youtube
it also runs flash
nook 1 , ipad 0
- the new update allows netflix to run
- there are some apps that are extremely useful
i love the smithsonian channel and pulse
- the magazines look great
the update also improve the navigation
- the interactive books are great
my daughter absolutely loves it
and now the bads- i constantly look for free stuff
unfortunately , b&n ; doesn not offer a lot of free books that are worthwhile
- the apps itself , is sad to say the least
the offering is a fraction of what you can find in ipad and amazon
and most of them are costly too
- while the update improve the speed of , it still is slower than ipad and kindle fire
- the speaker is terrible
it is located on the back of the device
if you hold the nook on your hand , you may cover the speaker
the best solution is to use a head phone
- the navigation overall needs to be improved
it is a basic android without much thought
at times i don not even know whether to or hold to get more options
here is my final take
if you are short on cash , and would like a good /tablet
go get a kindle
if you can find a nook for less than $150
go for it
i would not spend more than $200 on a nook ( be it a color/tablet )
there are much better options out there
update january 24 , 2012i have used my nook for a month now and all in all , i like it because it allows me to read my magazines and books
it sure beats a <NUM> incher tablet
the update 1
1 is definitely a must if you want to use nook color to its full potential
however , i found out yesterday that the update was actually used to close the loop on and disable any sideload of apps
the version 1
0 allows the nook to load amazon app and the launcher ex
basically it allows other apps other than b&n ; to be loaded
the automatic update 1
1 disable this option
so , if you are dare enough to install other apps , you can backdate the version to 1
0 if you want to load other apps
update february , 2012nook continues to lose to kindle fire in terms of contents
b&n ; could not match to the behemoth of amazon and i don not think it will ever be
however , if you are stuck with nook , there are a few apps that you must have ( they are all free )
it helps the nook color to be a good companion in a boring world
- netflix is a must
<NUM> inch on your lap and plug in a pair of headphones
you are good to go
- smithsonian is interesting
want to learn something that you forgot
this app works great but contents updates are slow
- dolphin internet explorer works great for anyone wants to do quick surfing
very fast and very convenient
- don not know what interest you , try stumbleupon
it randomly pulls internet content based on your interest
works great on youtube vidoes
- good with words , try nook crossword
- who doesn not use dropbox
it is a must
- springpad is great to jot down quick notes
- pandora works great too , but you need a pair of headphones though
- who needs newspaper when you have pulse .
i purchased this for my wife a week ago as an anniversary gift
i already have a nook st and an ipad2
it was a very simple setup
the colors are stunning and the build quality is excellent
it is not as fast as my ipad2 but it is no slouch either
the screen is very responsive to the touch
the nook color is perfect for someone who is looking for a device that is optimized for ebooks yet allows email , , and video
it even does flash which my ipad2 doesn not
i probably won not root it because for my wife is purposes it pretty much does everything she needs , but it can be rooted and used as a full fledged android tablet
i really like this device
it is a little on the heavy side for an ereader but it is a great value for $250
i would definitely recommend it to others .
edit - update 1
1 ( 12/21/2011 ) : big update rolled out on december 14th , with lots of big changes , most of which really improved the device
first , the "n" key , which originally functioned as a home key taking you back to the original home screen , now functions as the menu key instead , like on the new nook tablet
prior , there was a softkey arrow that would bring up the menu function , and barnes and noble has moved that function to strictly hardware
i am torn about whether i like this update , because honestly , i don not like relying just on a hardware key for something like a menu , especially with the issues i have had with nook parts ( i have owned two cords in the past year alone
) it does makes easier , when switching from one application to another ( say reading to internet ) , because you don not have to go to the home menu function first
for those of us nook color originals , it takes adjusting from old habits , but so far , it is not a bad change
the reader application functions in a much more friendly manner
the page numbers are on the bottom of the pages , instead of the top , in a much less chintzy font , and pulling up the menu tell you how many more pages are left in the chapter
not really a necessary change , but kind of nice
there are some fonts added , along with finally adding the option to change the tone of the page from white to sepia , night , or
the books also read sideways now , in a fashion , though i will admit , i don not use that much , and won not , even with the ability to have it on something other than kids books
just makes the actual reader app a much more rounded and friendly one
the magazine reader had a few changes that are nice
there are animations for the page turns now ( though why they don not have that option with the books is a big of an ) , though the animations disappear when you zoom in
the menu at the bottom pulls up the pages in miniature picture form , but are in a much more appealing , accessible manner
rather , really
nothing huge , but it makes it all more
randomly , the magazine reading app is the only one where the "n" button is still a home button , and not a menu one
wondering if they will notice that and change it in the future
the pdf reader had some awesome changes
before , reading pdf files was incredibly clunky , and did not resolve well on the screen at all
reading a book involved zooming in and scrolling down , instead of sideways like the ereader application , and when you closed the pdf file , reopening would take you right back to page one , and never saved your last place
ridiculously cumbersome , and not at all
the new update not only saves your place , but it resolves the page so that the text fits better on the screen , and allows the pages to read much more easily sideways
it also scrolls sideways , instead of down , which just makes sense and follows with the overall expectations of the reading experience
interestingly , enough , they still haven not resolved the issue of pdf files not having a cover when on the home screen or in the menu , even when the information is attached , which is something i was hoping they'd resolve
it is not a huge issue , but it is just a visual annoyance when all the epub files have cool graphics show up on the home screen , and pdf files just have grey with the title of the book
overall performance of the menu functions and flipping between tasks seems zippier than it was before , and i really appreciate that
the menu functions seem much more efficient and smooth , and that just makes for a much better interaction
the ebook store also changed around , and b&n ; completely reordered all the categories and changed the look
i can not say i appreciate all the changes they made , because you can no longer organize things like apps or books based on price , and instead have to search manually in the menu
i am frugal , i will admit
i miss the ability to find free apps easily , because let is face it , it just makes me happy
overall , i love the update they rolled out , though ! it is nice to know that b&n ; is staying loyal to their original customers and keeping the devices updated
* * *edit 4/12/2011 : barnes and noble did an update recently which fixed the glitches with the screen when plugged in , finally
i have not had any issues with the screen lagging or glitching since
* * *edit 2/28/2011 : a new update now allows for android apps and email on the nook , which is exciting
i am not all that into the apps they have , especially the games , but it is a nice touch ! it has also fixed the issue of not being able to put your own books on the home screen , and the issue that the nook was having with recognizing cover art for those books
i can now also put other apps on the home screen , such as the email or pandora app , which gives the entire thing a much freer , most customizable feel
though apparently this update has cancelled out the last one , because the screen glitches when plugged in are back
oh , well , i am just happy to now be able to put my own books on my own home screen ! vast improvement right there ! * * *original review , from 12/2010 : i received my nook color as a gift for an early christmas , and have been using it for a few weeks now , enough time that i decided i can make an educated review
pros/ has a great screen , with sharp resolution
book title colors and wallpapers look sharp and clear , and the touchscreen is responsive
you can adjust the brightness , though i rarely found the need to adjust the brightness even a quarter of what it could be , since otherwise it was a bit too bright on the eyes
that being said , i found that when you plug it in to a power source and try and use it , the touchscreen goes crazy , and won not even perform simple tasks like unlocking the device
you can not flip to the next screen without several swipes , and turning pages can be a haphazard activity
that weird glitch doesn not affect the device at all when it isn not connected to a power source , but it is such a pain when the device is low on battery power and you want to read while it is charging
-the hardware on the nook color is nice , with a muted metallic finish on the front and back , which gives it a nice grip , though i immediately bought a cover , so the fact that it is somewhat grippy doesn not matter much any longer
the weight is nice , about the weight of a small hardcover book , which i found rather pleasant when holding
i still don not get the random thing in the lower corner , though
it is like you are supposed to use that to clip the device onto something , but i hardly thing someone is going to just clip it onto their keychain for convenience
it is clearly not , but i guess it just seems kind of superfluous to me
oh , well
-the battery life is surprisingly good
i don not have to wifi on when i am at home , and the device will go for several days on
i actually had it on one charge for about <NUM> days one time , and was pretty impressed , considering other devices with lcd features tend to eat battery life like some kids eat cocoa puffs
-it is , which is great
however , b&n ; doesn not allow any apps from the android market , which is such a crime , considering that the tablet could be a fantastic tool if b&n ; would open up the gates on that one
the fact that it is isn not really a selling point , it is more of a potential point to keep an eye on , one that hopefully the company will do more with down the road
the tablet does come with certain apps like pandora and games like sudoku , which will do in a pinch if you are bored
-it comes wifi enabled , and it connects to networks easily and without issues
it does recognize b&n ; wifi , and remembers them , which means that you don not have to reprogram the networks or worry about not being able to access the features , which is really convenient
the browser is pretty decent , doesn not have flash , but performs very well
i actually used it for emails and checking my facebook when i was out of town , and it was snappy and quick , though the fact that it doesn not have pinch/pull zooming features ( which the picture gallery does , oddly enough ) is a bit of a , because it can make browsing somewhat clunky and inaccurate
-the b&n ; store they have on the device is convenient , loads content easily , and is very to navigate
once you have your information in , downloads are quick and easy , and you can also set a password for downloads , to prevent someone downloading books without approval
also , if you have a gift card for b&n ; , you can use it to buy books , but you have to go online to your account first , and save the information on your account before it will charge it , and it will always charge to that card first before your credit card , which is a pretty cool feature
-the reader itself is awesome , and you can sideload your epub files easily onto the device from your computer and start reading them immediately
you can not , however , read pub files like you can on a regular nook , which i found obnoxious , since i have a lot of ebooks in that format ( that are from a b&n ; affiliated website , no less )
you also can not put files that haven not been downloaded directly from the b&n ; store on the device over wifi onto your home screen , so in order to pull up your own personal files sideloaded onto the device ( even ones downloaded directly from b&n ; online ) , you have to go into the bookshelf menu and go from there
which means that if you don not have wifi all the time ( as i do ) , very few of your books will be able to be put on your home screen , which is such a childish thing for b&n ; to do , really
it takes away the personalization that the tablet could do so well , and bothered the heck out of me when i first discovered it
granted , you could probably fix it by rooting the device , but you run the risk of other issues in the software when you do that , so hopefully b&n ; will come out with an update to fix that annoyance
-the nook does read pdf files , but it is a very awkward process , since the screen ratio doesn not fit the allotted size , making the text tiny and incomprehensible , so trying to reads books in that format is a headache ; zooming in is awkward and clunky , and takes to long to be worth the effort
also , closing and reopening the file takes you back to the first page , which , if you are attempting to read an extensive document in several sittings , gets really old really fast
if you have book in pdf form , i would suggest downloading something like calibre and converting them to epub to save yourself the trouble
-music loads and plays easily , though i honestly haven not used that feature much , since i have an ipod , and if i want a playlist , i go from there
pictures also load easily , though you have to have it in the gallery/grid feature to see previews , otherwise they are just displayed with file type images until you click on them to open
silly little issue , but again , something b&n ; will hopefully fix in the future
anyway , great product , but really , more potential than actual greatness at this point
i love the fact that i don not have to leave the house to read a book , which is great since i am at home with an infant all the time
is it worth the money ? if you buy it directly from b&n ; online , it is $249 , which isn not an awful price for touchscreen reader ( it is really only about $100 more than a regular nook or kindle ) , so i would say that yes , it is
it is just still somewhat disappointing that it feels like it is , but i am looking forward to see where it all goes from here .
for me , this is a better purchase than the kindle fire
i just bought this nook color tablet from best buy two days ago , it is perfect
after charging it , i drove straight to barnes & noble books to try their wifi and buy a few books
trust me , the barnes & noble bookstore employees know how to operate the noook , and did a better job than best buy , at showing me how to use the nook and answer my questions
the set up and navigation is easy , and the user settings are user friendly
when reading books , i found that the bright white background screen was hurting my eyes
so i lowered the brightness level down to half of the default setting
yes , you can adjust the brightness as well as the volume
nice browser : when using the browser , it accesses the internet very quick
while using the wifi in the b&n store , i accessed hulu plus ( the video website )
i was in the barnes & noble store watching an episode of law & order
how cool is that ? the weight is a little haavy in your hand when reading books , but no where near as heavy as the kindle fire
the kindle fire was both thick & too heavy
on the kindle fire is screen , i had to fight & tap several times to change screens
i grew frusrtated , took the kindle back to best buy the same day , and exchanged it for the nook
i am so glad i did
on the nook , changing screens only requires a smooth tap
in summary , unless you need a tablet for business purposes , the nook ereader tablet is your perfect companion when traveling .
i picked this up as a gift for my teen son
it looks great and makes a nice web browser
i checked and found that it has 1
8 million free books ! ( actually more like 700 , 000 as there are repeated titles )
after setting up my account ( which would be changed to my son is after christmas ) i tried to download a free book ( sherlock holmes , the invisible man
) but b&n ; requires a credit card number , on file , to charge the $0
00 price to
here is my problem : my teen son isn not getting my credit card number
there is no work around either
i suppose that the b&n ; site would require a confirmation password , as amazon does , but , personally , i prefer entering my cc# upon a purchase instead of creating a running tab for myself or my son
i'd love to give this to my son , but it requires that i give him access to my cc number to download free books and the temptation to be financially irresponsible is just too great
if anyone has had their identity or cc# is stolen , you can see why this is a deal breaker .
am about to get a micro card with android c7 and use it as a reader and tablet
this let is me get rid of my netbook , nook wi/fi and router which free is up space and let is me use it anywhere in the house
hope it is a good move
cape guy
i have been down and up with this reader for the past <NUM> months , but since april , it has been a joy
b&n ; has gotten its act together
the problem i had with not being able to open books has been solved
b&n ; not only finally found out what caused some books to lock up but also how to restore them
there is no longer any problem with opening any books
when i first bought my reader , the tech support people were not
they are now
i have <NUM> books on it and no problems with any of them
now , the goodies : b&n ; just introduced enhanced editions of some books
these have videos , audio clips , animated maps , etc
embedded in the text
it is wonderful
i am reading , and throughout there are newsreel segments pertinent to the text
for instance , you read about eisenhower and then play the video of him talking to his troops before they embark for the normandy coast
you don not just read about bombing or fighting , you hear and see as well
it is a whole new reading experience and available only on the nookcolor ( or the ipad with the nook app
) pictures in magazines like national geographic are gorgeous
they look better than the print versions
there is a selection of apps for the nookcolor , with more coming out all the time
however , if you want all the android apps , then you can get an n2a sd card on amazon that turns your nookcolor into a full android tablet with access to the market
you then have the option of booting the reader up as a nookcolor or an android tablet
you can even get a kindle app so you can get and read books from kindle on your nookcolor
some people say that the backlit screen has glare and that you can not read it outdoors
not true
i read my nookcolor in my sunny back yard all the time , and , although i am a <NUM> year old lady , i can read for hours on it with no problem
now for the goodies besides the enhanced editions
you can get an app that allows you to work on office documents on your reader
downloading files , pictures , and music is a breeze
the nook also allows you to borrow ebooks from public libraries
all you need is a library card
libraries all over the us are lending ebooks
so , you don not have to buy all the books you want to read
that is a big saving
and , it takes less than a minute to download a book
you just connect your reader with a usb cord and adobe digital editions displays the books you have borrowed & you drag the ones you want to the my nookcolor shelf
as with kindle , there is also a lend me feature so that your friends can borrow from you
the touch screen is very sensitive and i am very clumsy , so it took me awhile to be able to navigate easily , rapidly , and without bringing up unwanted menus
but that was true of the iphone when i got my first one , why don not i go all the way and give this <NUM> stars ? because the device doesn not have a "sync to farthest point read" feature , so if you decide to look at an earlier page , the only way to get back is to use this awkward slider bar
i can never get it to stop at just the page i want
the same is true of clicking on endnotes
when you are through reading them , you have to navigate backwards to the text
there is a back button displayed on the notes page , but it disappears before you can read your note
b&n ; has some work to do on this
in sum , if you buy it at barnes and noble , the nookcolor is only $249 , half the price of the cheapest ipad or even android tablets
yet , for $39
95 more you can get the card to turn it into a full android tablet
it is incredibly more versatile than the kindle
page turning is smoother than on the kindle--or am i the only one who sees the afterimage of the page you are going from while you are turning pages on the kindle ? on the nookcolor , like the ipad , you just touch and you are on the next page
one other thing : naturally , a touch screen will get smudged
b&n ; says to wipe it with a dry microfiber cloth
i found that didn not clean it enough
if the screen isn not clean , it can get jumpy
so , knowing that the iphone has a capacitative touch screen as does the nookcolor , i tried using the products sold in the apple store to clean the screen
they work perfectly
as mentioned in my earlier review , i also like the nookcolor feature of your being able to share a passage with a friend without leaving the page you are reading
also , i find the web browser is just fine
in fact , when i am reading and see a name or word i need more info on , i just touch it and when the popup appears , i choose wikipedia or google and surf to my heart is content
then i just touch the "book" icon on the lower screen and i am back to the page i was reading
it is smooth and fast
i belong to goodreads and when i am through with a book , i can just go to the goodreads app on my nookcolor and post my review immediately
small touch , but nice .
a decent color , but pretty much worthless for internet use
the thing will only connect in the b&n store
apparently it is extremely finicky about the hub that it will connect to ; meaning most hotspots will not work
there is lots of online discussion of this defect in the color is design
i bought mine last summer
and now you have the option of the kindle fire
but i have just been reading that some of its new owners are having trouble with , too
so , apparently there is no free lunch with these relatively inexpensive android e readers .
my friend loves her nook
i purchased it as a gift to my friend , already own one .
this is my first , so my target audience for this review are primarily those who are also considering this relatively new technology
my initial requirements : in anticipation of some heavy travel , i decided that i needed something that would allow me to purchase and store enough books to last me <NUM> months
more importantly , i wanted something that would allow me to highlight and take notes on passages
finally , if the physical copy of a book had pictures in it , i wanted to be able to see those pictures on my
what i like about the nook : --one of the first things to attract me to the nook was its simplicity
there are only <NUM> buttons to be seen : a power button , volume up , volume down and the nook "menu" button
the buttons are inconspicuous and don not protrude
--i was able to download almost all of the books i was looking for from the b&n ; shop
to be fair , some of the stuff i read is relatively obscure
--i like the ability to highlight passages with different colors and take notes
--i like that it shows pictures from books
--although it wasn not something i was looking for at the start of my search , i found that i liked the games ( chess , sudoku , crossword puzzles , etc )
--finally , the touchscreen is pretty responsive ( not perfect ) and the menus are mostly intuitive
a few things i don not like about the nook : --as mentioned earlier , the touchscreen is good , but not perfect
it can be really touchy and trying if you are trying to get a certain passage highlighted
even more difficult is trying to navigate web pages using the browser
i don not recommend the nook as a netbook or ipad replacement , but it is nice if all you use it for is downloading more books or reading some online news
--pictures from physical books sometimes show up on the nook version of the book
when they do ( like maps in fantasy novels ) they are usually much , much smaller
unfortunately all the nook books i have seen don not allow you to resize or zoom in on these maps or pictures
overall : for the most part , the nook met my initial requirements
some things i didn not think i'd use much before ( chess , etc ) i actually use fairly often and will come in handy to pass away the time on a long plane flight or layover
if you want something that will just read books , then i am sure you can find something better
likewise , despite all the extra feature that the nook has , it is no threat to the ipad
but for those that are looking for something , the nook is a handsome , intuitive and reasonably priced alternative .
my wife loves this , and it is one of the best christmas presents you can give to someone who truly likes to read .
i really like amazon and wanted this for my wife for christmas but why would the change more than buying direct from b&n ; ? i like the service and everything i have experienced with amazon but i would not pay $65 more ( ? ! ) than going direct to b&n
; sorry this time amazon , i just went to b&n ; .
the nook provides a lot of hidden features
i read a couple reviews and im still learning more about the product
challenge is to find parental control
wife loves it , uses it daily , works good , the only problem to her is when you charge it thier is no indictor light to say when it is fully charged .
yesterday i spent over an hour playing with a real nookcolor at my local b&n ; , where i have befriended the staff as i go there almost every day as an unemployed
anyway , i was very dissapointed at this iteration of the nook
first off , the nookcolor is very heavy
i think it is almost <NUM> pound , and since it is not a true tablet , you are supposed to hold it in one hand , but it will strain your hand muscles after a few minutes
even the b&n ; guy told me to hold it with two hands
that is pretty pathetic , i must say
the only way to use it for more than a few minutes is to pop it up on some support , which obviously is not convenient for a device that is primarily an reader
second , even though it is much faster than 1st- and nooks , it is still slow , especially when browsing the web
now , page turns are generally faster , but there is no animation , and sometimes there *is* a slight delay so you are never sure if the device registered your turn gesture
very annoying
third , the screen is but rather poor in contrast and viewing angles
i think the resolution is 1024x600 , and the dpi is in the high 100 is , but overall i felt the screen looked coarse
i guess for this price , they have to pick some cheapo screen , so no surprise there
the color lcd screen , of course , draws down battery pretty quick , a fact even the b&n ; staff acknowledges readily
also , the screen is completely unreadable under direct sunlight
speaking of the screen , the digitizer is not very responsive , whether you want to zoom in or out or type something
it is slightly better than my ipod touch but that is still a very frustrating experience
fourth , the software is still buggy
the demo unit in store had a few books , but half of them could not open , with some mysterious error message
the web browser could not render several web sites i tried
fifth , the interface is very confusing
there is the hard nook button , there is some kind of drawer button on the screen
after an hour i still found myself tapping the wrong button to do something
very dumb
sixth , of course , you cannot access the android marketplace app store , at least without jailbreaking this
very few apps are available and there is no indication b&n ; will allow more aps , since they wnat to use this sell , which carry fat margins and have amazon and its founder
in short , this is a disappointing device , not the least because its hefty weight and barely useable screen are just ridiculous for an reader
the list price is $249
99 and b&n ; does offer a money back guarantee if you buy it from them .
i should preface this by saying i also own a nook ( non color 3g ) and an ipad 3gi order a lot from amazon so when it came down to getting an it was a tough choice to pick b&n ; over amazon
why did i do this ? i still love the value of a retail store , living down the street from a b&n ; i go there often to shop and pick up little gifts as well as browse books
there have been plenty of books that by their cover ( yes i judge ) and short summary i would have bought but because of my ability to skim the book in store i have decided not to buy
similarly there are some great books out there but for photography and coffee table type books , you really can not experience them the same way with a nook or an ipad
all that being said , i decided to support b&n ; because their library is just as large as amazons and i throughly enjoy their storefronts
ok onto the review
reading on the nook color is easy , the android interface is fast and reliable , not to mention easy rootable ! reading on the nook vs the nook color is vastly different because of the eink display on the nook
there is a fair amount of eyestrain associated with reading on a backlit display but i had no problems reading for well over <NUM> hours on it
the font was just as clear and easy to read as on my ipad
size wise it is not much different than the original nook but is much heavier
it is lighter and easier to carry than the ipad because of its dimensions
in the end i did not buy this product to read on it , i bought it to root and use android honeycomb on it
this makes the this the best value out of any reader on the market in my opinion
the nook has virtually the same specs as the samsung galaxy tab aside from the 3g
at $250 ( buy directly from b&n ; ) you cannot complain , honeycomb runs smooth and opens up an entire world of possibilitiesfor this little tablet .
it constantly acts up
i try to use it for my textbooks but when i try to turn the page it glitches and zooms in
the touch screen randomly clicks things by itself , also doesnt allow returns
would not recommend
i originally had a kindle and loved that one too
the problem with the kindle was the button you use to navigate
i needed something more ergonomic and so i bought the nook color and send the kindle back to amazon ( only had it for <NUM> 1/2 weeks )
i just love it ! it is easy to navigate , turn the page , download and purchase books & free samples
just haven not found the magazines i am looking for , so with that , i will go to the b & n store for assistance
i also had to contact the company regarding a question on deleting samples
they were courteous and were able to answer any and all my questions with patience
i would recommend this product
it is a little heavier than the kindle , but so worth the extra money for the ease of use .
got this for my sons 15th birthday he loves it a great gift for anyone great price and it came fast love amazon
i got this a ago and put cyanogenmod on it and it runs smoothly
nothing is instantaneous , but everything is quick .
purchased for my son is school a/r reading program as a prize for his school
this is the third one purchased , at the a/r program is leaders' request
the look on their face when the one , who wins , finds out what they get ! totally amazement ! would purchase again !
i don not usually jump on new technology or new products , but
on seeing the vibrant color display of the nook color ( nc ) , i took one home for a week
ebook pros : very quick to setup for ownership and downloading
quick page turns and refresh rates
an accelerometer quickly permits reading in landscape or portrait mode
after resizing text you don not have to scroll down to see more text on the same 'page' you just sweep your finger across the screen from r to l to see the next part of the page
the touch screen--sensitive & fast
you can lend books to other nook owners for <NUM> weeks , and it really is a loan--you cannot access the book while offered or loaned
( same as eink nook ) you can borrow ebooks from libraries
( same as eink nook ) you can read a book for an hour each day at any b&n ; store
( same as eink nook ) ebook cons : short battery life , hours ? the touch screen
don not touch it while reading or 1
a menu pops up for things like brightness settings , text size , highlighting , dictionary , share options , find button , content button & a slider to zip to a page quickly or ; 2
the page might turn , or 3
the page will scroll vertically or horizontally
you must hold the device by the margins outside the glass
great if you hold by the edges when you read a real book--all others , take notice , as my hands did tire of holding a book this way
you wish , after having seen how you upsize or downsize pages on the ipad ( pinch/spread <NUM> fingers on the glass ) that you could do the same here
on the one i bought i saw some very irregular activity related to the menu flashing on and off without my having touched the screen & also the virtual keyboard would occasionally act up , e
, a single key press of 'n' might give me 'nnn' or 'nmm' or even 'niin nothe virtual keyboard requires you to press a '123' button to get numbers
web browser pros : great color and resolutionon almost any monitor you will have to scroll up/down to read long text passages
the nc seemed to know how to center and wordwrap the text on most webpages in the display so as not require you to scroll left/right
virtual keyboard has a "
com" button for entering web addressesweb browser cons : it doesn not enlarge pages by the ipad/samsunggalaxy pinch/spread technique
you first must slide a finger on the screen to bring up a +/- buttons in a corner and then touch +
same issue with my big long thumbs on the glass
it will scroll if i move my thumbs
i couldn not send an email until a bn tech directed me to the portable versions of [
] ( [
] ) "m" for mobile
doesn not have 3gsame problem with the keyboard as above
when i took it in to b&n ; , it played innocent and behaved well
later , at home again it went nutty
final verdict
not for me
perhaps a later version with better battery life , maybe color eink , a version of the browser that supports adobe flash , a more behaved virtual keyboard with number keys above the letter keys
possibly a carrying case that keeps my fingers off the screen while viewing
technology gets better and more affordable for late adopters .
i had the original nook , had a friend is kindle for a couple weeks , and now have the nook color
although it is a bit weird to be writing a review of it on amazon , i felt that potential kindle purchasers should understand their options
the nook color is , by far , the best ereader i have used ( including the ipad )
it is not perfect , but it almost is
the lcd screen is very easy to read , which surprised me since i was a big fan of and did not like reading on the ipad
the lack of need for a night light is great , and the software it ships with is lightning fast and almost
really , there is no lag when i am using it and the functionality ( once you spend <NUM> minutes learning it ) is
bn is quickly catching up to amazon on content
frankly don not notice a difference anymore
plus , you can ebooks from google and elsewhere
i know this
i will never go back to again and love this screen
i also love the delivery of magazines on this thing
really , it is better than the real magazine
you get full color reproduction of text and pics , and it gives you an article view if you just want to read the article
it is a great way to get magazines and will be better as they get more publishers ( right now , it is a decent list but it could be better )
i also really like the multimedia support
i can load photos and pics on an micro sd card and take my music with me
if i am in a wifi area , i get full pandora support ! i wish it had 3g , but this is still great
having said that , the color is not perfect
first off , the weight , while acceptable , is slightly too much
it won not cause strain like the ipad and is perfectly capable of being read in bed ( you can lock out the gyro so the book doesn not flip portrait=>landscape ) , but it is not the unnoticeable weight of the nook or kindle ( or paperback )
still way better than a hardcover though
second , the screen , while great , is slightly tactile , not glass like you would be used to on an iphone or android phone
this is nitpicky , but i noticed it
third , no flash support yet ( and , while it is a great , it is not a laptop , ipad , or even like my htc evo )
this , and the lack of , affects my enjoyment of the web brower ( note : you can zoom , just not )
update : pinch zoom is here ! it is very good , but not great , implementation
makes the browser that much better ! fourth , the newspaper delivery , while acceptable and similar to the original nook/kindle , is not good enough
frankly , it is easier to read the web pages of the papers than on this and pales in comparison to the magazine delivery , which really is superb ! finally , and most importantly , is the battery
this is not like an e0ink reader
to give you an idea , the other day , i started out with a full charge and i read around <NUM> pages of a book and did some light browsing
i did not use music or pandora and did not pay any games
at the end of the day , i had to charge it again
this was about <NUM> or <NUM> hours of use
that is ok with me but it ain not the type of thing that you can go on a three day road trip without your chord like the kindle or original nook
anyway , it looks like my cons are longer than the pros , but really , this is a great product
i can not wait to see amazon is response and appreciate the ( hopefully ) friendly competition that this represents !
had one since christmas <NUM> and already owned a regular nook , so i am familiar with the differences between the displays
the nc is a fabulous , if a bit heavy , device that is a great ebook reader as well as video player out of the box
root the thing and it becomes an android tablet , giving you access to a lot of functionality
i have no issues with reading on the nc
adjusting the brightness and contrast is easy enough and i have read for hours with no eye strain
i am more than satisfied with it because unlike the kindle , i can read almost anything ( and rooted even kindle books using the android kindle app )
works with library lending , free ebook sites and the calibre tool helps expand what you can read even more
hands down , it is the best device out there at the price .
i got this for my wife as a christmas present because we have a bunch of books in epub format
i put them on a microsd card , went through the arduous setup procedure and now it will not open any of my books
i have , over <NUM> hours invested today trying to get support help
phone goes to some third world place and i cannot understand the people
chat ( 4 times ) is better but they finally concluded it wad my credit cards fault ! basically , useless support
returning it tomorrow .
bought mine a few days ago and returned
it is an ok device but does not truly shine as an ereader and i will expand on it shortly
1st , this is more a hybrid device than an ereader
an ereader basically is for reading documents in an electronic format
examples of good ereaders : kindle ( of course ) , nook 1st generation and sony
nook color , besides allowing you to read , let you browse internet , listen music , play some games and much more tablet oriented stuff
of course , there is nothing wrong on that until you start thinking about how important color and internet are for just reading a simple book
so , what is cool or nice : -internet
full color internet experience , with nice virtual keyboard and ok browser
touching the screen and keyboard is like an ipad or similar tablets , but is comfortable enough for short emails or using wikipedia or google
-pdf supportwith nook color not only you can read pdfs in a nice full color screen but you can expand or zoom in at will , move along pages with a simple touch or even rotate and read in landspace mode
this feature is really amazing and the selling point if reading pdfs is your only or most important task
-full color screenpretty obvious
if you like magazines or would like to get electronic subscriptions of any of them , look no further
the resolution , colors and screen is perfect , a real pleasure to read using a nc
depending of the magazine you can also extract or read the text or article portion only , leaving images apart
but !
not everything is perfect
-no landscape mode for booksyou have landscape mode while reading pdfs but not while reading regular epub books
this was a real surprise to me , a bad one ! landscape mode allows you to rotate and read poetry or technical books without cutting the paragraph or breaking lines
with no landscape mode you are forced to read every book "as is" and for a hybrid table which costs more than $200
00 , in my opinion , it is not acceptable
my kindle <NUM> rotates and it is <PERCENT> cheaper ! -lcd screeni must admit this device has less glare issues than ipad or galaxy , but if you have read using eink technology you would not go back and change to lcd again
reading on a nook color for several hours is not easy for your eyes
and forget about using it at your pool or outdoors , unless is cloudy or you find the perfect angle ; the glare will bother you while reading anyway
indoor is a different story but it created some eye strain on me anyway , specially after long reading sessions
-heavyfor serious readers ( those who read novels , fiction books , technical books ) or more than <NUM> or <NUM> weeks per month , please think again before buying
with about 18oz your hands and wrist will start complaining soon and if you don not have a desk or something to put your nc on , your choices are using your tummy , chest , lap or knee as additional support
a deal breaker
being a kindle <NUM> owner i know what i am talking about
you can hold a kindle <NUM> with one hand and read for hours with little or no problems at all
-batteryonly <NUM> hrs of continue use , average
i bought it a tuesday , read for about <NUM> hrs that day , went to bed ( leave it on but in sleeping mode )
next day morning turned it on , used it <NUM> more hour and soon after that the device was at <PERCENT> of battery life
( i barely used internet and brightness was at minimum ) another important point about battery and charge is that the nook color must be charged via wall , not usb or computer unless screen is off , which means you must forget about using the device during the charging process
the adapter is also proprietary so you can not use your nook 1st gen adapter or the one some androids use , i don not like that , i don not like proprietary stuff
the more standard , the more common , the better to replace or find
-no zoom or ability to enlarge imagesan image with wrapping text around in that cool book ? if you can not read it or maybe is too small , then sorry
you are out of luck
you have ( at the moment of this review ) no way to click , expand or enlarge that image
if you read mostly novels this means nothing to you
but if you read technical books with some images or illustrations on it , the size will be so small that is basically useless and not readable at all
i can not believe this simple feature is absent and i can only hope for a future fix via based but not full access to android marketshame on you b&n
; this device could be a real hit if was not so closed or locked
as usual , this device will be hacked for those with brave hearts or basic computer skills ( actually , it has been ) but warranty will not be honored and it is a hassle to keep it up to date after official b&n ; firmware upgrades , in case you hacked or rooted the device ; also you won not be able to read books if you root it
while b&n ; keeps selling the unit without android market or a restricted version of it , this device will be like having a magnum revolver in your hands without any bullets
so much power with android/linux but you just can not use it
-no "read me" featurefor a $200
00 tablet , i would expect this feature
the kindle it is not so powerful in terms of hardware or processor and it reads the english books for you
summaryif you read a lot , portability and battery life are important for you , forget about nook color
if you are a casual reader , looking for a fun device and distractions ( internet , games , etc ) nook color will fit your bill
just keep in mind that nook color is not a true ereader though , but more like a tablet with reading abilities ; if you are aware of that and eye strain is not a concern , this can be a great buy
for now , i will pass
my kindle <NUM> is simpler and lighter and does very good what it suppose to do : let me read ( or read for me ) my favorite books
most novels and technical books are not in color so i don not need a tablet with internet access to enjoy them , why bother then ?
last year my husband asked me if i wanted a kindle , because i love to read all the time and i try to be when possible
i was intrigued , but my biggest weakness is magazines and i didn not like the availability or look of them on the kindle
when the ipad came out , i was blown away by the beauty of it , but felt like for a few dollars more i could just get a whole new laptop and it would be almost the same size
for travel , the ipad seemed to big and fragile for me ; i need to be able to jam all my toys into my backpack and not worry about them
when i stumbled onto the nook color , i absolutely flipped my wig and couldn not wait to get one ! full color magazines , that look just like they do on the newsstand ! this could save the rain forests - i seriously buy a lot of magazines
i also save them forever because you never know when you might want that one article or photo again , which drives my husband crazy
so perhaps the nook color can save my marriage as well ! that is a lot of expectation to put on this adorable little device , but i think it is up to the challenge
santa decided to come early to our house , so i just started playing with the nc a few days ago , and it is my first
it was almost fully charged right out of the box , so i was able to start playing with it in less than an hour ( it says you can use it while it is plugged in , but they keypad is very oversensitive when plugged in so i don not recommend it )
it easily connected to my home wifi and linked to the barnes & noble account i had set up earlier that day
if you don not have home wifi , you might have to visit a public wifi location in order to activate it
i recommend setting up a b&n ; account beforehand if you intend to purchase anything from there , as it makes the nook use very smooth and enjoyable
books : there are many many books available from a variety of online sources , check the product details for formats ( please note it does not support kindle format )
i understand it is also easy to download books from your local public library , though i haven not tried that yet
the b&n ; shop function within the nook itself is the easiest interface but certainly not the only option
while reading , it is very easy to adjust the font , screen brightness , and more to make it as comfortable as possible on the eyes
at night i turn the brightness all the way down and find it very comfortable for my eyes while reading in bed
i have read for hours on end without any sort of headache
i haven not used the highlight , , or share functions very much yet , but they are super easy to incorporate if you enjoy that sort of thing
page turning is an intuitive flip of the finger , or you can tap the side of the screen to move forward or back
children is books : the color on these looks amazing , and the "read to me" feature is wonderful for little ones learning to read on their own
i imagine this would be great fun for a kid stuck in the back seat of a car for a long trip too ! there aren not a ton of read to me books available yet but they are adding more every week
i don not even have kids but these are pretty awesome
magazines : obviously this was a major feature for me ! the appearance of the magazines is absolutely gorgeous , the text and photos are clear and sharp
you can use the "finger pinch" method on the touchscreen to zoom in and out , or you can use the "article view" feature to pull out just the text of each page at a pleasant reading size
the magazine includes every single page that you'd find on the newsstand , including advertisements , which to me is a benefit because i sometimes enjoy the photography and trends those provide
magazines can be read in portrait or landscape format , and you can flip through thumbnails at the bottom of the page to reach a particular article
most of the currently available magazines offer a purchase or a free trial , then bill you monthly for as long as you want to receive issues
subscriptions are very easy to manage so canceling is not complicated
so far there are about <NUM> magazines available , and the number seems to be increasing regularly
newspapers and pdf is : i haven not tried these yet , though some have reported formatting that make certain ones difficult to read
the ones purchased directly through the nook store are more likely to be formatted appropriately for the device and easier to read
better pdf support is likely to come in a future firmware update , though a lot of it depends on how the original publisher sets up the file
internet : you do need a wifi connection to go online ; 3g is unlikely to be available for the nook color unless you also purchase an accompanying data plan
so far most web pages look crisp and beautiful , but are not as fully functional as on a laptop or computer
flash functionality is not available yet ( but is planned ) and a lot of people are experiencing difficulty with email and other text box typing
i believe this will be fixed very soon , but for now the web is more of a "" experience
music : you can load your own music or use the included pandora app to link to your pandora account
the speaker isn not great so headphones would come in handy
i am extremely in love with my new ipod nano so i will probably strap that on while reading rather than use this feature
video : our first try produced some choppy playback , but i think the processor was very busy setting up the hardware because we had just gotten it out of the box
after that , it played everything perfectly with video quality ! it will play videos in mp4 format , so get yourself a converter and a microsd card and load it up for your next trip ! apparently videos can also be through the cord
i have only tried it on the card ; it reads directly from the card with no problems
other : you can add your own photos to use as background , or just to show friends
it comes with a few games ( sudoku , crossword , and chess ) which work well and are fun
"lend me" is an exclusive feature that allows you to swap books with other nook users , and you can find groups of folks online who will swap with you if none of your friends have a nook
it uses the android operating system , and an app store is scheduled to open sometime in early <NUM> so there will be much much more available in the coming months
i am the type of person who doesn not need my phone to be a camera , my ipod to be a dvd player , or my to be a laptop
the nook color does a wonderful job as an of not only books , but also magazines and newspapers , and it has some other fun bells and whistles
it does what it is supposed to do very well and the additional features make it a great value for the price
i would give it a million stars if i could !
i agree with the other positive reviews
the color nook is an excellent reading machine , much better than either the kindle or the b&w nook
using the color nook is totally intuitive with only a few positive surprises at some unexpected capabilities
the battery life is around <NUM> hours , so you will need to have your special recharging cord , which comecolor s with the nook , handy
there are small imperfections in the nook operating system that will get corrected as barnes and noble releases updates
the same was true with the kindle and b&w nook when first released
the key to a good reading experience with the color nook is to turn the brightness down , way down
that way eye fatigue is minimal , similar to the b&w readers with similar brightness
even with the brightness down , the contrast is excellent and the letters clear
when browsing the web , you might want to turn the brightness up a bit to beautifully display all those colors
the web browser is excellent
it works for email , especially google mail
the trick with the power limitations is to keep the brightness down when using the nook as a reader and turn the internet off
only turn the internet on when browsing or shopping
that way , when you put it down at night , the power level will be the same in the morning as it was when you went to sleep
costing only $249 ( dec 2010 ) at barnes and noble , it is affordable and useful , especially if you travel
the minus <NUM> star is for the few little glitches in the 1
0 operating system ( based on android 2
2 ) , for the <NUM> hour battery life , and for the current lack of apps
for what it is supposed to do , it does it well ; it is better than an ( smaller , lighter , and far less costly )
upgrades and apps will follow , making an excellent device even better .
bought this for my wife to replace her aging sony reader
she really enjoyed it as a backlit reader and web browser for many months
then i decided to root it and turn it into a full android tablet
now it is sooo much more than what she ever thought she needed and something she can not live without
performance isn not bad on anything we have installed
rooting takes some tech skills , but isn not too bad
i would highly recommend the tablet even if you don not root it .
i gave it to my granddaugter for christmas with a gift certificate
my daughter says she loves it & it helps her improve on her reading skills .
i should preface this review by stating that i am predisposed to liking tech gadgets that are a bit geeky , but do appreciate good industrial and ui design
the nc is really a great color ereader that also happens to have the makings of a terrific , android based tablet
bn literally buries the android os under a very thick custom ui and turns off many android features
this thick customized layer is what make the nc a great ereader , but a not so great a tablet
so while it is locked down , it does what its meant to do very well
one can get to ebooks in either the epub or adobe pdf format
either format works , looks , and reads very well , easily as good as the best the market has to offer in terms of an ebook reading app
the fact that bn chooses to bury the location of the downloaded content and prevents one from creating shortcuts to either the book file or folder , placing said free books on the book shelf , or even listing them in your list of books is an annoyance to the tolerant and tech savvy
to and those less tolerant of mucking about with a gadget , e
, grandma , it'd be a showstopper
but then again , would such a user even know how to get to free ebooks ? movies , again in the file system , look great , but bn has capped the max resolution below the abilities of the screen and the stock player is finicky about format
for instance , my ripped for ipod touch movies play fine
my ripped for droid incredible movies aren not playable
this despite both are mv4 files with aac soundtracks
the latter are higher resolution and bit rate so that is the issue
again , annoying , but not a real problem
the web browser is just fine
pretty much a stock android browser so fast enough , compatible enough messing around , but if i were going to really do some research , i'd use my computer
with android 2
2 coming in january , and a bn 'approved' android market , it will be an amazingly capable tablet for the money
and that is what one has to remember , it is an exceptional value given the hardware ( fast processor/gpu combination , great ips lcd screen with better color/resolution then an ipad ) , 512mb ram , expandable storage , great build quality ) , and has the best ereader app bar none
once android 2
2 is added with some access to at least a few other apps like email , better browser , and a more format flexible music/video player the value will be simply unassailable
at the price

first off , for those of you buying this product expecting the experience , you are wrong
this isn not an screen , if that is what you are looking for , go with ( a ) the original nook , ( b ) the kindle , or ( c ) any of the other dedicated on the market
this iteration of the nook is marketed towards certain select categories of readers : -the magazine with text books that have ' books with lots of book readersif you notice , these are categories of readers that benefit from the ability of the reader to handle color graphics , which is something can not yet do ! pricefor the price , you are getting an android tablet with limited functionality , though , with some technical knowledge , it is possible to unlock this device to be able to fully take advantage of the android market ( though it may void your warranty , so do it at your own risk )
similarly sized android tablets go for prices starting at double the price of the nook color , but they come with full functionality
another device this has been compared to is the ipad- which runs at about twice the price as well for the very base model
on the price point , you are definitely getting a decent deal , though , you are sacrificing some of the functionality for the the reduced cost
also note , you are not getting 3g access or any other cellular service to access the market- unlike the original nook , that came with the free mobile access to be able to make purchases from the nook market on the go
the likely reason for the lack of mobile access is due to the fact that this device runs a lot faster and features a full web browser- this increases the speed and easy of the user to access web content- which would be undesirable to any phone service that hosts access because it would reduce the service that their paying customers get
instead of mobile data service , users have the option of accessing the bn market and the full internet through wireless
with today is cell phone technology , many phones are able to be set up as wireless hotspots that users can use to get access on the go- when they are away from their home network
overall , this isn not a big deal to me , but i am sure some original nook users depend on that free mobile service to get access to the bn market , so this would be a draw back for you for sure
weighthonestly , this device does run a little on the heavy side , however , i do believe that it is slightly lighter than it is predecessor
still , for the market , it is heavy
for the tablet market , it is a little more reasonable
the weight is a sacrifice , but as long as you aren not trying to read while laying on your back , you should be ok
user friendliness and extra featuresi find this device to be quite simple almost immediately
every function that i have looked for has been where i expect it to be and everything has worked smoothly for me
the page controls while you read work great , and i love that they now give you the option to tap to turn the page rather than having to swipe like you did with the last version of the nook
the full web is pretty easy to use once you get used to typing on a touch screen keyboard ( which is always annoying )
this device also integrates with your facebook , twitter , and google accounts
this is great for the avid readers that want to be plugged into their social media
another feature that is nice to have on the reader is pandora- it is a nice added bonus to have internet radio available on the reader
one thing i wish this device had was access to android market , but i guess you can not have everything
overalli like this tablet
i think it was a good buy and i would buy another one if this one broke
for the price , you are getting an underpowered tablet , but it still has access to the full internet- which you can use multiple windows in
it is primarily a reader , which makes me wish it were as easy on the eyes as , but for the market it is being geared towards , you can not really complain about that !
it came early which is nice , it didnt come with a box which was already described in the details
but it was nice , came as described and worked fine .
i didnt buy my nook color to read
i bought it because i wasn not thrilled at paying $500 for an ipad
as long as you have a micro sd card and can follow a few simple instructions , you can turn this into a android tablet
best of all , you can run android entirely from the sd card ( i recommend <NUM> or 32gb ) and if you need to put this back into "nook mode" ( for instance , for warranty repair ) , simply remove the sd card and it will be as if you never did anything out of the ordinary
with the cpu overclocked to 1
1 ghz , i can play angry birds , listen to music , and download a file all at the same time , and that is the heaviest usage scenario i can really envision for one of these .
well , for the price , it is easily the best android tablet out there if you don not care about not having 3g , gps , and camera
took less than <NUM> minutes to root it once i did all the reading on nookdevsdotcom wiki
installed launcher pro , google maps , few widgets , angry birds , and opera browser
the device has great style and build quality and battery seems to last pretty good in my <NUM> hours of play time with it
screen is gorgeous
i think if they skipped hard metal and went for carbon metal or good plastic it probably would have shed few ounces in weight and would have felt lighter to hold for long time
that is no deal breaker though as the 7" size is perfect to hold for long time unlike other tablets that are way too big to hold with single hand for reading
tried couple of kids books for my daughter and the color screen makes the content look rich and attractive
will soon be trying out periodicals and photography books
but my main intention of owning it is for tablet and i would recommend it
i read instructions on how to make nookcolor connect to adhoc wifi hotspot
once i get that working , i can tether the nookcolor with my rooted xperia x10 to browse while i have no wifi networks around
i wish i have some cons to mention but that would be silly at it is price point
it is a real steal at it is $249 price .
high points : -very responsive touch screen is easy on the eyes even though it is back turning ( very fast , instant , and seamless - no flashing or delay - my favorite feature ) -very organized sound home screen button ( very useful ) -free ebook fridays curtesy of barnes & technology from your local library ( if they offer this service , mine does , it is a very nice feature to have , only reason why i chose a nook over a kindle ) -the kids books are fun to read on internet browsing experience is quite nice
web pages load interface and device are both very accessories available for size - fits easily in my lit display is very very nice to have - no need for a flashlight - can read in the dark ) -very easy to book mark games on this are a lot more fun than playing games on the original nook ( thanks to the touchscreen ) -barnes & noble ebook store is quite nice and easy to keyboard is also nicelower points : -battery life ( if i used the internet at all , i am lucky if it lasts through the day on a full charge - with the internet off , it still only last about <NUM> days if you use it everyday - the standby battery life ( with the device in sleep off ) is pretty good though
-no physical page turning button - sometimes i advance or flip backwards by ( not a deal breaker , you get used to it , but it could be a lot lighter ) conclusion : i love love love my nookcolor
i take it with me everywhere i go
there is no 3g option that i am aware of , but i only browse the internet with i am at home anyway
the battery doesn not last long enough for you be connected to the internet too often anyway
there is no cool page turning animation like on an ipad , it just changes instantly to the next page , which is still a great feature on this item
it is not so great as a tablet though
the internet browser is great , but there is no flash support ( not for the ipad either though ) and there are few apps
that is not important to me as i am using this as an ereader and occasionally play the included games on it when i am bored ( sodoku , crossword , chess )
i like that you can play music and listen to it in the background
when connected to the internet , the pandora radio app is nice to have in the background , though i have found it rather difficult to turn off when i am done with it
i highly recommend this to anyone who wants an ereader and doesn not care if they have to charge it back up every few days .
technology changes and grows with each passing second , so sometime in the future , something else will eventually dethrone the nookcolor ( just notis the way of things
i was a blackberry fangirl , and converted to android when it finally stepped up to the plate
but blackberry was nothe best' for me until droid )
with that said as justification for my 'current' qualifier in the title
for me in the current available items on the market , it is nookcolor all they way , baybee
the screen is fantastic , both indoors and out , and it is readability is profound
i don not like it is failure to be as responsive whilst plugged in and charging , but when not plugged in , i have yet to have a problem with it
i love how it is divided into different options , and that it supports pdf as well as the epub format
there are books galore out there in this manner
i also love that i can share this particular unit with my <NUM> year old daughter who is just starting chapter books , but still has a love for picture books
we have several tomie depaola books on there already for her ! as an android fan , i'd of course love to see it connect to the android market
but i didn not buy this to be a bigger version of my android
i bought it to be an ereader
with the add'l memory space avaialble , and the fact that the battery can be replaced , just those two features alone for me raise the nook or nookcolor head and shoulders above the kindle
that said
while i had a slight preference for the nook itself over the kindle , i am even more thrilled i waited until the nookcolor came out
i am looking forward to a long future snuggled up with my new best friend
; )
i got a nook color for my anniversary , and returned it within the trial period
it worked fine ; it just was rather pointless
i have a kindle , but i wanted something more functional that i could read in the dark ( i love my kindle - the nook was in addition to , not as a replacement )
to make the nook into a true tablet , you have to hack it
we did that , and it was ok , but still not able to access the entire android market and some apps just didn not work right
i did a factory reset and returned it , then ordered an actual android tablet ( which i have not yet received , so i can not compare them yet )
there wasn not anything wrong with the nook , really
it was just a lot of money for what is basically a glorified .
i got mine from b&n ; and i am very happy with it ! my color ebooks look so great on it
the only problem i have is with playing youtube videos
i am using the link b&n ; put on my bookmarks
other than that though , its awesome
it works really well & haven not had any trouble with any ebooks
however some image scanned pdf books need to be flicked up/down instead of sideways like regular books
update : after playing with it a little longer , i got things going better
my youtube videos all work fine and i love it even more now
i have actually purchased a few different ereaders before this since i was trying to find one i liked ( such as sony touch , kindle and a few others which are all newest models ) and my nookcolor is my absolute favorite ! a few problems that i hope may be fixed with future updates is when i visit certain pages ( ex : google
com ) & tap a text box to type something in , my keyboard will dissappear & i have to tap text box a few times to get it to reappear
the other thing is my sound seems very low when turned up all the way
in any case , i still love it
the color is amazing & i can use this for hours ! no eye strain trouble here & it is able to read every ebook i load onto it
i haven not had to buy any b&n ; books yet because i already owned so many
part 2 : loved my nook color before the new software updates and app additions
but now ! wow ! i own a motorola xoom tablet and have only had it for about a month
if these updates had come a month earlier i may never have purchased the xoom , but with that said , and now that i have both , their are differences that i am glad to own both
nook color for the value : emailgamesadobe flash ( you tube and much more ) musicreading ( books and magazines with brilliant color ) prefer the nook for reading bookssurfing the internetsize ( easy to hold ) and for women it fits in my handbagversus
motorola xoom : emailgamesadobe flash ( you tube and much more ) sharper picture when viewing movies/videosmusicreading ( from kindle and nook downloads to the xoom with their apps ) surfing the internetsize ( being larger for a better viewing experience ) it won not fit in my handbag ( but that is mine ) quality is amazingmuch more
there are many many things similar to the nook versus xoom or ipad but the value of the nook color over the others isthe best and for your average user who just wants to surf the net , view videos , read your email , listen to music andplay ( at the moment limited games ) and to read books ( size for holding to read is perfect ) the nook color is the best valueand it won not disappoint
1st review : received my nookcolor for christmas and waited until now to write my review
i wanted to make sure what i write will help others
take this device for what it is
a and not a tablet
i love it for reading ebooks and emagazines
a perfect size for books and just a little too small for magazines but if you have patience you can make any page larger just by pinching your fingers open
the color of photos are amazing and beautiful
i can view just about any website , but not videos from flash
again this is not a tablet
but i can view many youtube videos
i have downloaded my own photos and they look great
i cannot open my emails from my carrier ( comcast ) , not sure why
the website
but not the individual emails from my contacts
the touchscreen is pretty sensitive and sometimes i end up having to do things twice
i gave my review four stars only
because of my email restrictions and the sensitivity of the touchscreen
overall i do love the size and the many things you can do with the nookcolor
i typed this review on my nookcolor .
you can get this for about $40 less at b&n directly ( plus tax ) , or at that same lower price , without tax , at their site .
i bought this item for my wife for christmas
i didn not know what to expect since this wasn not what she actually wanted
but i knew what she needed as she is a book worm and has magazines n books strayed everywhere
she also has no intent on getting rid of them no time soon
needless to say it had to grow on her ( she wasn not too thrilled at first )
now that thing is everywhere and i don not haveto live with magazines everywhere taking up space
afterward i bought an hd+
we have been more than happy with our decision .
the colornook was a great device when they first put it out at the end of 2010
however , it is incredible with the new upgraded software that came out at the end of april 2011
you can do email , there are apps , videos are super ! and there is flash
i also like the fact that i can adjust the brightness of the screen to prevent eyestrain
you can have multiple email addresses on the email account , which is great for me as i have <NUM> separate email addresses
in an effort to protect my computer from emailed viruses , i am opening my email on my nook
that way if a virus sneaks in , it takes out a less expensive device than my computer
i also like the idea of being able to subscribe to magazines that are photo intensive and i can actually see the pictures in color
that said , i still like my kindle ereaders very much for reading books .
the nook color is ok as an reader and the apps barnes and noble offer are ok , but i installed a 16gb sd card with the android os and this thing is smokin
i can watch netflix , listen to local radio stations and you can get any of the apps in the world , not the just few barnes and noble offer .
i bought the nook color after using the original nook wifi to read a few books
i am sure like many people i was drawn to the "color" of the screen
it is crystal clear , it is great for books with drawings or art in them
really brings it to life
this is about all i have really liked
what i don not like is its heavy
compared to the original nook and the kindle it is a heavy monster
the screen glares with everything
i hate seeing myself in the screen when i am trying to read
the touchablilty of the screen is <NUM> times better than the b/w nook
it doesn not turn when you turn the nook itself , even though you have the screen adjustment feature turned on
did i mention it was heavy ? also i took it outside and yes i adjusted the brightness all the way up
however , i could not read the screen with my sunglasses on even at its brightest setting
it is like my iphone , can not see the screen in sunlight
this is the part that frustrated me the most
also the lighted background of the reading screen seemed to make my eyes excessively tired after long periods of reading
the battery life is pretty short too
overall , i wouldn not recommend this ereader
get the kindle , you will be much happier and it is cheaper
also kindle books don not charge tax to buy them like nookbooks .
i bought a refurbished nook color a few months ago as well as a android card ( from ebay )
this is by far the best value tablet i have found anywhere ! nc is well made , arrived in condition , reliable , responsive and by booting to full android ( with the ) it is a real tablet with full access to the android market
only cons are lack of microphone or camera , but for a total cost of &lt ; $180 it is awesome ! good battery life , beautiful screen , responsive and a really excellent reader ( especially in low light - but the screen can be made very bright for daytime use )
i also have a kindle keyboard which i love for daytime reading but the nc works in the evenings in a darkened room and does all the other things a tablet can do
just nc on a holiday trip and left my laptop behind ! nc was perfect for email , rss , games and reading , including pdf books and netflix movies
if you have an android phone , using this is the same with a much better screen
it is a really good tablet as is , but with the msd card it is an awesome deal !
i went into the tablet market for two reasons : ( 1 ) i read mostly inside in the evenings and was tired of needing a book light for the reader and ( 2 ) i wanted to consolidate my travel electronics from phone + ereader + notebook
the prices of straight tablets were outrageous to me when my primary purpose was to eliminate taking the laptop along to be able to review email and do moderate web browsing on a decent sized screen ( the phone was way too small )
after reading several reviews and recommendations , i settled on a used nook color for both price and performance
i have not been disappointed
i have rooted my device for a full blown android experience and a far superior web browser but rooting is not needed for the basics
i am just someone who likes to tinker
everyone needs to understand , this is an first and a tablet second even when rooted
at $200 , you cannot expect what you would get with a $500-$600 device
but , it does what it is intended to do quite well
at <NUM> inches the screen is comparable size to most and that was important to me for portability
i simply swapped the reader for the nook color and it still fit perfectly in my purse
the nook color is also really good for reviewing emails and smooth web browsing
my rooted device has an overclocked processor so i have no problems with speed
it is perfect for quickly reaching out to the web to check the latest news , weather , etc
and then get right back to reading my books
i haven not had many problems running other android tablet applications and have found that the problems i have had seem to be common problems with the applications themselves
if you want a premium , this is a super nice product at a great price
if you are looking for a budget tablet without all of the bells and whistles ( camera , gps , microphone ) but that will handle the basics of email , web browsing , netflix , hulu plus , and other consumption tasks , this is more than adequate and enjoys much more favorable reviews than similarly priced tablets ( with the exceptions of the kindle fire and its own successor the nook tablet )
the bottom line with this little marvel is to keep your expectations in line with what you are paying for and what you are not paying for
if you expect a $200 version of the standard bearer ( i
e ipad ) , then you will be very happy
if , however , you are expecting a $200 equivalent , then look elsewhere .
i have a amazon kindle and few hundred books and was wondering ifthe "nook" works on the same book format ( mobi ) as the kindle
i emailed a friend last night and he wrote back this morning saying his nook was dead in the water ( it can happen with any of them ) what was funny was he said he wrote a review on the nook and said that he purchased a color nook and have enjoyed it for many years
then one day it stopped working so he called customer service and was transferred to some foreign country where the woman could not speak english well , so he asked to speak to another
next a man came on who spoke worse that the woman so he asked if there was another person
when talking to the next person he was rude so he asked customer service if he could sent it in for repair
the nook rep
had gotten mad and said sure sent it back to north korea and hung up the phone
he said he sent a number of emails and they didn not respond or when they did they say read the manual
so john the nook is great until you need service but to answer your question i can not open mine to see the format so you may have to go by a barnes and nobel and ask them
you may need to hurry as barnes and nobel books stores may be closing the doors soon
most everyone is switiching over to the .
i was looking for a for our <NUM> year old is birthday this past october
after researching the popular i
the kindle fire , i went with the nook color for one simple reason ; the ability to root it and turn it into an android tablet , for a lot less ! ( it also takes a macrosd card )
while you can find the kindle rooted too , i found the nook color rooted was more readily available and more affordable
since i was purchasing for a teen i did not want to get a new or more expensive model
we purchased one that was already rooted to cyanogenmod 7
you can also purchase an macro sd card here or on ebay that is rooted for you if you already own a nook color
we connected it to our home and viola , she can do everything i
text free , download games and unlimited apps from the market
the rooted nook color can do everything a tablet can do except for make or receive phone/video calls
note , all rooted nook colors are not the same version
we purchased one for our son for this christmas and i did not notice it was not cyanogenmod 7
this is relevant as it did not possess full access to all of the apps on the google play ( or android market ) as our daughter is does
you can update the root software and i did that but i did not notice a change in its ability to download the other apps
but honestly , i was tired at that point and gave it to our son on christmas as it was good otherwise and i doubt he would notice
lolthis model is perfect for my teens , but i am thinking about the kindle fire hd for myself because it has a good camera and i love photography
i also purchased a silicone case in yellow and it brightens up the dark tablet a lot
( i purchased both nook color used for $66 and $87 each on ebay
this was a life saver for me after my wifes operation it kept her occupied we still have it and she loves great investment
i don not know why people make fun of these i just happen to love mine
it is very versatile , easy to use , you can add more space , and it is not too big
and it seems like they are getting huge now
i get hours of enjoyment out of it from reading , doing puzzles , playing games and listening to music
and mine is used !
i am sure a lot of other potential owners are wondering which one to buy
i was ready to order a kindle , sight unseen , because anything that sells that well with so many rave reviews has to be good
then i went to a local "big box" store that carries the kindle and the nookcolor and seeing the fantastic color screen of the nook sold me on that one
nothing against the kindle but the nookcolor brings childrens books ( i have a 4yo granddaughter ) and magazines to life
the nook has a few quirks but none are deal breakers
if you can , take one for a test drive .
i bought the nook color for its intended role as an ebook reader
i have a kindle dx but it has trouble with many of the tabletop rpg pdfs i throw at it and the 4gb is a tad small to hold my 14gb collection
the pdf reader is worthless , slow to open files the kindle dx had no trouble with and wouldn not even turn pages
i jail broke it , install a mostly vanilla image of froyo and installed adobe acrobat and from there it shined
page turning and navigation was a breeze and it complimented ( read ) the kindle dx quite well
it is a tad small for anything more than book reading and angry birds
even casual web browsing can be a pain and it is place as a bastard hybrid of a phone os on a 7" tablet form factor means it has the worst of both worlds
maybe once ( if ? ) android tablets take off we will see mobile pages more suited to them
the huge up side is that it fits perfectly in a large coat pocket and looks sleek enough to make you look cool removing it from the pocket of an aviator jacket
in the end it spends most of its time sitting on a shelf collecting dust
it will probably end up a gift for someone who doesn not mind electronics
these days while the kindle fire looks good i am waiting on the market to mature and windows <NUM> tablets to ship before i go looking again .
a syndicated consumer advocate has a saying : "i am willing to pay less for less
" so am i
i actually bought the nook color ( nc ) more for its tablet features than its features
i considered several tablets for at least double the price , but when the new android os was released for the nc , i decided to try it out
i personally have not been disappointed
here is what it doesn not have : camera , usb accessory support , fast processor , robust app forum , 3g model , and long battery life
but as i said i am willing to pay less for less
i primarily wanted it for basic web browsing ( with flash capability ) , movie playback , capability , and capability
my experience has been great so far - i have had my nc for about six weeks
i personally have had no problem with the web browser and it has met all of my needs
movie viewing has been fine and i have had no problems viewing them
i use handbrake to convert movies/videos to a format for the nc , and it works great
i have several accounts i use for personal and business purposes , and the pop3 support the nc offers is perfect
i am no longer tied to my pc , laptop , or confined to the small screen of a mobile phone
as for the reader , it is great as should be expected ( my <NUM> year old daughter actually uses it for reading more than me
i download books from the library for her , and she loves it
) the notation , highlighting , and other reading tools are fine and it also has several options to customize the font and background color as well as the font size
other reviewers have commented about crashes , but i have not had a single crash yet
and i also don not think the stock android os is bad at all , but with this being my first experience with a tablet and android os , my expectations may have been lower than normal
i am also hoping that the app market will improve over time
i know i could root the os , but for the time being i will just stick with what it came with
to sum it up , i got what i paid for and am very happy ( so far ) with my nc
purchased the nook color over a month ago
i have been reading alot more since i got it , as it is so convenient to take everywhere
i have not had any issues reading in the car on sunny days
i also like the ability to read at night in my bed without any lights on , thus minimizing chances of waking up the wife
the screen is very sharp and easy to read
magazines look awesome on the nook color and it is so much more convenient than having a stack of magazines clutter up the house
i do not think it would be easy to read on the beach under direct sunlight , but it will be fine if you are under an umbrella ( which is what i do when at the beach , as i am cancer phobic )
connection is automatic , seamless
the web browser is better than i expected - and i use it often to read online newspapers and check email ( way better than the kindle is browser )
there is to be a sofware upgrade in the next month or so which will enhance the nc even more
or you can root it yourself to turn it into a full blown tablet ( at half the price of the galaxy tablet ! ) the only drawback is the weight of the nc - it weights about the same as a hard cover book ( though easier to hold than a hard cover book ) .
the button is located so that you will frequently turn off tbe machine by accident
the power button should be recessed
same for volumn control .
exactly what my daughter wanted
she is more than tickled with this reader
she will use it for hours and hours
i bought this with my brother for father is day
i tried to help him use the product thinking that i am a reasonably educated person
the main problem that we had was trying to read google ebooks in pdf format
i tried different methods
downloading directly didn not work
and they will tell you this too as their help desk told me
and downloading it from a pc and transferring it
even after going to a nook kiosk , they were unable to figure it out and they even called tech support
apparently they just don not work
this whole process of trying to get pdf ebooks to work was soo frustrating
other huge negatives
not very responsive and poor battery life for something that doesn not doo much for you and isn not that simple to use
my advice
get a refurbished ipad
you will be happier for the small price premium over a nook color
it does so much more and is worth the price .
i was instantly the hero for my wife this christmas , when i surprised her with a nook color under the tree
the device has great aesthetics , with a <NUM> inch ips lcd display that is one of the most pleasing i have ever laid my eyes on , a thin and sleek profile , wonderful packaging , and nice support from barnes and noble , but that as paul harvey would say is only the beginning , this review is about the rest of the story
at first glance this appears like just another ereader , but with a color screen for magazines and children is books swapped in for the normal eink , but there is something different lurking beneath
this device runs android 2
1 under the hood , heavily modified as it may be out of the box , and with that choice of operating system comes a potential access a world of hackery that is well beyond the reach of any other ereader
in order to access this world you need to be willing to educate yourself a bit and root this device
the process is actually quite simple ( go to forums or nookdevs
com nook color portal to read about it ) , and despite the dire warning disclaimers quite foolproof , and fully reversible ( just in case you need warranty service )
once rooted , the device gains access to android market , where you can get thousands of apps , games , and tools for free ( legally ) , or for a small purchase price
compared to the currently empty nook app store , the android market is bursting with exciting activity
a rooted nook color gets access to the kindle app , so you can basically read all your amazon purchases on this device too
sony reader app is coming soon from what i have heard , so you are probably going to get support for that store too
tied to the kobo ecosystem , to borrow a phrase , there is an app for that
emulators for old game consoles are working nicely
playing angry birds on a <NUM> inch tablet is so much more fun than on a tiny <NUM> inch phone
stock browser lacks pinch to zoom , download dolphin hd , and there you go
can not put app shortcuts and widgets on the home screen , home switcher and one of the freeware launchers ( adw is pretty nice ) got your back
a rooted nook color becomes something of a worthy competitor to the much more expensive ipad and galaxy tab
unlike real android phones and tablets , this does lack the physical menu , back , and search buttons , but a software softkey is installed upon rooting , so there are functional virtual equivalents to do the job
don not get me wrong , there are some things that won not work , as nook color lacks a 3g radio , camera , or gps
the rom is also a heavily modified version , so some abilities have been stripped out , and won not be available until a true custom rom is available
but more apps a likely to work than not due to a capable processor , ample storage packed underneath , and most importantly a talented and dedicated hacking community willing to experiment with their device and then educate others
this is still early in the development life cycle of the nook color , so their are some rough edges to the process , some things will require resorting to the command line to fix
considering what you get for the money , this is probably the best handheld portable device on the market today
an instant game changer without a doubt .
once i replace it is crippled version of android os , and replaced it with a cyanogenmod version of android , i found the tablet to be very capable
the only negative is that it is a little on the heavy side .
i finally was convinced that i could enjoy an ebook reader , did my research , and settled on the nook color
my goal was to be able to carry a few books around for pleasure , maybe even some business documents
even though i have an iphone , i thought i would diversify and go after an android based platform
i figured that even if i decided to go with the ipad eventually i could use the nook app on the ipad to read the books that i have bought
after a few weeks of using it , i am close to handing it over to the kids or jailbreaking it for experimentation with android , and getting an ipad
1 ) the quality is low
the software is buggy , ironically one of the buggiest parts is trying to buy a book , where it more often than not hangs after a purchase with the download in limbo
the battery charge socket seems to be flakey , so that often the unit gets confused about whether it is charging or now
2 ) can not buy books when you are outside the us
so , on an international business trip - when it'd be nice to pick up a few books for the plane or to pass time in a cafe - one can not buy a book
that sucks
3 ) although in theory i could load a bunch of pdf documents onto it for reading , the display is too small for them
the interface for pdf documents , in terms of adjusting fonts , scrolling , is very limited
device is useless for this
4 ) the book selection is slim
i don not think my tastes are that obscure , but i am not interested in the mass market
forget pulling out old sci fi classics
forget getting a textbook
and i find that some of the books that i would like to read are available for the kindle but not the nook
5 ) the iphone nook app is super buggy
in theory it should let me sync , get my books on the iphone too
but the iphone app just hangs and doesn not sync to my account , even after a reinstall
if you read the reviews of the nook app on the app store , they are all saying this
6 ) the app selection is slim
email doesn not work with outlook and there is no vpn support
better to just get an ipad , clearly .
i absolutely love love love my nook color
one of the main reasons i am so happy with it is because i purchased the micro sd card that turns your nook from an into an android tablet
it works perfectly ! now i can enjoy the nook ebooks but also have access to all the android apps and features .
i purchased my nook color in june of 2012
i had been online looking at various and comparing the features
i finally decided on the nook color
*pros*-beautiful responsive touch battery life ( you must leave the off unless you are using it ) -good overall feel to the device
seems solid and fits nice in your hands
-pretty decent web browsing ( youtube etc ) -custom sized text sizes , ( you can go from small to very large ) -expansion micro sd card slot , ( supports up to 32gb ) for music , documents etc , note you cannnot store purchased from bn
com on the card ! *cons*-diffcult to read in direct sunlight , ( due to the technology used for the color display ) -books can be expensive , but are generally slightly less than retail , no physical book means you don not have tons of read books cosuming space around your home
-nearly have to pay for all apps , ( angry birds , etc ) -wimpy single speaker that is hard to hear even with volume turned all the way up- if no screen protector is put on this device , you will have greasy smudges and fingerprints galore
invest in a good screen protector i would suggest the 2x caseen glareshatter
here is the link : [
]-sometimes the nook color will freeze , prompting you to restart
also , you will want to purchase a cover for the nook color to keep it from getting scratched , or banged up here is the link to the black moko case i have
]considering what it does , it is a great device , its not a $800
00 ipad , so if you purchase this with the expectation of it functioning like an ipad you will be disappointed
this is a nice color with basic web browsing , email reading and sending capabilites , so if you wanna check your email and do some light web browising , this is for you
the battery life is amazing , but this is only true if you keep the wifi off
if your wifi is left on , and your not using it , battery life will be short
i only turn on wifi when im downloading a new book ( takes about <NUM> seconds ) and when im doing email or web browsing
the web browsing feature is ok , but no subsititue for your desktop or notebook
just keep this in mind
all in all , a good purchase , very pleased with my nook color ! update 11/15/13* seems to be performing well
if you leave the wifi off you can get very long battery life
this device was great for its time , but since being released back in <NUM> better things have come out
its fine for reading
but not much else .
i have owned the sony , kindle 1 , <NUM> & 3 , sony and the nook color
each one has advantages , but none more than the b&n ; nook color
hold the nook in your hand and you hold a reader , tablet pc , mp3 player , and photo viewer
it seems like it should be a , but no so
with an optional leather cover ( many cool choices at b&n ; is site ) it weighs in at about a pound
heavier than the kindle ? sure , but also does so much more
the features that make this a are the 7" color touch screen , full keyboard , and browser
the browser is a mac , so flash video is not supported , but all others are
youtube , facebook , twitter , email and everything else appears just as it does on your pc
page turns are an effortless swipe on the screen
two things i consider drawbacks are , first and foremost , the battery life
don not expect more than <NUM> or <NUM> hours
b&n ; says <NUM> days , but that is in hibernation mode
that drawback is kind of big
i am forever charging the nook , and charge time is hours
the other drawback is backlighting , which is unfortunate but necessary for the brilliant color screen
adust the page color in "settings" and reduce the
aside from the battery life , the nook color is the best thing going out there
you will enjoy carrying up to 8 , 000 books ( with added sd memory card ) , staying connected with , and it all comes to life on the color touchscreen
open , connect , enjoy .
ordered the e reader for christmas last year
as of today , my daughter is using it and loving it
she says , no regret she loves it .
i initially purchase the nook color last year as a cheap alternative for a web device to check email and surf and read a few books now and then when not lugging my laptop around
when they upgraded and opened the android capabilities it became an android table pc with dedicated email app and improved web goodies
at last check they now have <NUM> apps and growing , most are kid stuff and games but do have some useful apps for weather , calendar , note taking , flight checker , etc
i can transfer word , excel , photos and music to it and learn more each time i mess with it
the one thing missing was a 3g capability of the black n white version
both 3g and bluetooth are built into the guts but who knows if and when they will be turned on
my solution is virgin mobiles broadband2go mifi wireless that supports up to <NUM> connections
you can use it for as little as <NUM> bucks for <NUM> days or <NUM> bucks for a month and more options
i have used the usb version as a backup when traveling for about <NUM> years so felt ok with the wifi version
works fine with the nook , did have to use `forget' and reconnect the first time but now have a fall back `secure' wifi connection
doesn not have some of the fancy features of bigger better and more costly table pcs but for everyday email and surfing , ez to carry around with a nice cover , enough apps to suit in general with more to come it more than meets my needs and no monthly bills to use it .
not quite a tablet , not a dedicated
and that is ok with me for $249 ! i had my first two nookcolors replaced , the first due to a sd card holder spring that failed after <NUM> days and the second due to an unresponsive touch screen and problems with powering on
customer service had me on the phone for about <NUM> minutes and took me through two factory before i finally convinced them to replace my second unit
note that all replacements of defective devices are , not new
finally , i am experiencing what barnes & noble had in mind
nookcolor <HASHTAG> works great and now that i have a unit with a touch screen that works as it should i am finally realizing what a great little machine this can be , with a really solid and nice add is like pandora and other apps , as well as web browsing that really works well for a function that is secondary to the nookcolor is primary role as an
i really appreciate being able to listen to any selection from my itunes library straight off the sd card while reading or surfing the web or playing around with a couple of the apps i bought
standard quality mp4 video files play smoothly , and most were converted to that format via third party software on my pc ( my videoconverter )
the app store is still and i really wish this had 3g capability so i'd have an excuse for taking it with me more often , but at such a low price compared to 3g tablets , i have become very enamored of this machine
the questionable quality control , a screen that is reflective in bright light and the weight of the device with cover are my only complaints , and if i had not encountered the quality problems i mentioned this would have been a solid 4- or review , especially considering the price vs
competing tablets ( because it really is in the tablet category , especially with android 2
2 froyo installed ) .
i have had my nook color for about three months now and i must say it has been one of the easiest devices to root
this is a great bargain for $249 once you turn it into a full fledged android tablet
forget about nooky froyo and go directly for cyanogen mod )
you can then install the b&n nook reader app and amazon is own kindle app ( along with 1000 is of other apps like angry birds ) .
we bought two of these - the amount of reading we are doing has significantly increased
since it is epub compatible , we can borrow from the library , download from guthenberg and google , as well as purchase from bookstores
the screen is bright and visible in the sun
wireless n connectivity is fast and easy
web browsing is fast and useful
pdf , ms office document viewers work well
battery life is surprisingly good
we have two of these and an ipad - the nook color is what we are tending to use - mainly because of the size and weight
the ipad is chiefly used as an expensive toy
barnes and noble bet the farm on this device and it paid off .
i think that all international customers should be forewarned that barnes and noble prevents you from being able to purchase any books online from their bookstore , you will be sent emails stating that books can only be sold to customers "physically" residing in the united states
this is all despite having an international credit card accepted all over the united states ( even by barnes & noble themselves as this is the same card that i used to pay for my b&n ; membership ) and despite even giving them my us postal and physical address where all of my packages would be signed for by a real person
the thing that angers me the most is that i explained to barnes & noble ( via phone ) that i live in trinidad and they said that it would not be a problem for me to purchase books , but after purchasing a nook color plus additional items such as screen protectors , a leather case and a <NUM> gig sandisk memory card ( all bought on amazon ) , i have not been able to purchase a single book
if international customers are not welcome , there should at least be some type of warning on their website
i feel like i was by barnes & noble , and the sad thing about it is that i bought it all as a birthday gift for my wife
shame on barnes & noble , that sales rep lied to me just to make a sale , my money was good enough for them but i am not good enough for their product
now i have this new nook color with all of these extras just gathering dust
it is sad to see just how low some companies will stoop to make a dollar
the real slap in the face is that after registering the nook on the barnes & noble website for the purpose of purchasing books , they have no problem sending me offers week after week to purchase even more of their products but as far as i am concerned , they have lost this customer permanently
this review has nothing whatsoever to do with amazon
com , my gripe is with barnes & noble for giving false information to secure a sale and caring nothing about international customers
( update update update ) in the interest of fairness to barnes & noble and giving you amazon
com community <PERCENT> reliable information i decided to open an account with a bank that is based in the usa to see if b&n ; would be able to access the funds from that account , i am trying to find out whether it is a location issue or just a payment issue so we can all know for sure
i decided to try this little experiment because i just can not understand how i can gain access to sample books from b&n ; but every time i try to purchase one there seems to be a problem , what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the that was sent by b&n ; after i tried to purchase a book via my scotia master card ( books can only be sold to customers "physically" residing in the united states )
i now have a bank of america visa debit card which i have not tried as yet , it is possible that the issue with barnes & noble is that they cannot access funds from my scotia master card which is based in trinidad so i will give the bank of america card a try seeing that it is based in the usa and if that does not work then the last resort will be to try using my pay pal account
i will post an update as to whether it worked or not
( update update update ) i am sorry for taking so long but anyway , let us get on with it
as i said before , every time i tried to purchase a book there seems to be a problem , what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the that was sent by b&n ; after i tried to purchase a book via my scotia master card ( books can only be sold to customers "physically" residing in the united states )
well i found out that it is possible to purchase books on the nook once you are using a us based card
i was not able to purchase books using my scotia master card but i had no problem whatsoever when using my bank of america visa card , so it definitely has nothing to do with our geographical location , or ip address
the only issue that i see here is the fact that not everyone has access to a us bank card but you may still have a chance with making purchases via paypal
i have noticed that there are some us based sellers that have problems accessing funds from trinidad based credit cards , some even have problems accessing funds from us based cards although they are also in the us themselves , in cases like this i have found that the best payment method to avoid any headaches is via paypal
i have never had any issue when paying via paypal , even when other forms of payment could not work
i hope that this helps a little .
i bought this used but i was pleasantly surprised that it was like new
i rooted it and made ita droid pad
i am using it right now to write this
i like it better than my ipad .
i am new to nook color and bought over <NUM> books on the day i purchased the device , naively thinking that all publishers adhered to the text size options available within nook ( the <NUM> letter 'a' images incrementing from very small to the largest )
much to my dismay when i later had time to go through all of the books i'd purchased and play with text sizing and font options , i found that this was not the case
indeed , the maximum size for many of the texts was too small to be read by people with visual impairments
my plea to barnes & noble , publishers , amazon and other vendors who produce ebooks is to please keep pepole with visual disabilities in mind and adhere to standards that will meet various needs
in the us alone , there are millions of partially sighted people who need for text to be enlarged , made bold , underlined , etc
my feeling is that 'corrected' versions of these books should be released and people who have already purchased them should be given the option to get free download replacements
personally , i have visually impaired people in my family and i will no longer purchase any book that does not at least allow for larger text sizes
nook color is a great device but in the end it is only as good as the software and texts that is uses , so for now i rate it <NUM> stars until the above issues are addressed and implemented
i know i speak for many , and thank you for your time and consideration .
bought two of these for my daughters and they both have issues when reading books
the pages jump after a few minutes of reading and the menu screens pop up and down constantly
power off and on to resolve but it keeps happening
i am returning these today and getting a kindle
oh yeah and it locks up totally every so often and again you have to power it down , very disappointed
barnes and noble support is terrible
i purchased for my wife as a gift and she loves it
product met all of her needs and she loves being able to just select a book and download it without any hassle
battery lasts a good amount of time and i can now sleep at night without a flashlight beaming in my face on accident !
it will be gone soon , and i can not say i will miss it
our county library lends out e readers for patrons to try so i got on the list and after three months it was my turn to try the kindle color nook
it doesn not overwhelmingly impress me though the color and clarity of the screen is as good as our kindle fire is
text on the screen is clear and turning the pages is easy
one advantage the nook has over the fire is that it shows page numbers instead of the fire is percent of book read
spudman would prefer to have page numbers but has adapted to the percents
my wife and i are both comfortable navigating the fire and barely had to refer to the owner is e manual
i don not like moving around on the nook , and that may be solely because i'd become used to the ease of the fire
trying to surf the web on the nook was very frustrating , and watching movies or video clips on the nook was an ordeal with herky jerky motion , slow responses , and freezes
we watch free tv shows on the kindle fire with smooth enjoyment
the fire was a gift to my wife from me
she loves it
if i were to buy a small device for reading , i'd prefer to buy a tablet and download a reading program on it that enables book downloads
that method may preclude the ability to get free books ( it does on the kindle ) , but it is a circumstance i'd accept
in summary , the color nook is pretty good as a reader
those with children might be intrigued by the animation capacity of the nook on some children is books and the option to have the book read aloud by the nook voice
as a web browser , the nook , in my experience , doesn not work as well as the fire does
in choosing between the two devices , i chose the fire because i prefer the amazon site to b&n ; is , like the vast number of kindle books on amazon , and was totally persuaded by the vast array of free books , movies , and tv shows that come with amazon prime .
my girlfriend uses it every single day
i bought it for her as a christmas present
and she loves it .
very disappointed with this device : * ) touch screen is quirky , buggy and unpredictable
* ) no way to get back to where you were if your finger happens to slip
very bad
* ) doesn not display side loaded drm epub covers correctly
* ) freezes up fairly often , especially browser
* ) when hooking up to a computer , files often get corrupted , device freezes after you restart , 'home' screen gets messed up , etc , power down button misbehaves
i have had to unregister and start from scratch <NUM> times already because of these issues
* ) b/n hardline pop oriented marketing sucks
* ) b/n bookstore misrepresents , mislabels books - show one cover , get a different book
you can end up paying for a gutenberg press item that they displayed with a phoney commercial cover
* ) dictionary is limited in its vocabulary , and you can not access the dictionary by itself , nor does it link to other words or references
this is a compromised reader and a compromised tablet
i am sorry i bought it
i have never used a kindle ( nor will i ever ) but besides the kindles , if you want a good reader , get a sony t1
if you want a tablet , buy a real tablet .
i already had two of these in the household , but my son has been asking for his own since the first day i got mine
i am very pleased with the nook color as it does a wide range of functions
i have been able to do my university homework and write papers on mine , in addition to reading ebooks ,
pdfs , and watching videos
my daughter reads , listens to music , and watches videos
my son will be making use of reading books for his age group and reading level , and watching instructional videos .
the nook color is a reasonably priced device that will allow you to download multiple books and store them as well as access email
right now it only has one book in it and has not been used for email since we have three computers readily accessible
i had a router which the nook could never "lock onto" via wifi , so i changed the router to a cisco , linksyn which solved the wifi problem
downlaoding books from barnes & noble is a little too easy once you set up an account with them and the books are somewhat expensive considering they are only electronic and intangible ( $14
00 for a 300+ page book ) .
i loved the nook
i eventually bought an ipad and gave this to my nephew , he still loves and uses it everyday .
i am with b&n nook this product is only good at their site
and the choice of books and apps is poor compared to kindle
i purchased a nookcolor a couple of months after it came out
within a week i had to return it because it would not charge
a lot of hassle was required to get a replacement and it took a couple of weeks to get to me
once i got it set up i used it about <NUM> times and it locked up on the home page
it took <NUM> days of conversing with a tech before they finally decided to send me another replacement
i received my 3rd one and it lasted exactly <NUM> hours
screen went black and the lower right corner heated up to the point it was too hot to hold
this time they were nicer about agreeing to send me a replacement
the 4th one is sitting , unopened , in a box in front of me
well , after having trouble with three of them i no longer feel i can trust this device to work consistently ( unless you consider always breaking as a form of consistency ! ) and would like to get a complete refund
so far b&n ; ( the site i bought it from ) won not do that for me
moral ( s ) of the story : 1
stick with a kindle - i bought an early version of it and still love it
and if you want color go wtih the kindle fire
only buy products though amazon since they are very lenient and curteous about returns
( they weren not selling the nookcolor when i purchased mine
) it is now about a year later and i am still trying to get my money back
my plan is to take this unopened box , all receipts and emails to a nearby b&n ; store and hope pleading in person will get me a full refund
wish me luck !
i got this as a gift about <NUM> months ago
it does a few things well , like being backlit so you can read it at night with no lights
after that it is all downhill
battery life is about that of a really long life laptop
at the store they told me not to expect anything better than <NUM> hours
and if you are not connected to wifi like i was not at a cabin for <NUM> weeks you can not even set the time , there is no function to do that
i mean really
and if you want to archive a book you can not because that is only an function
any files you add can only be deleted when connected to a laptop
in bright sunlight it is barely visible unless you find some shade
if you are not connected to wifi and your book expires , then the little book icon gives you a message that says "the content is no longer available"
what that content is remains a mystery to me and you cannot fix the error until you connect to wifi , after which it miraculously fixes itself
all in all this may be usable like a really slow laptop around the house , but for traveling its not worth lugging around
really , why even use it around the house when i have a fast laptop already that does a lot more
this thing is just not ready for prime time , paper books beat it hands down
get a good led book reader light and keep your $
i asked at the store if i could return it and they said only within the first <NUM> weeks with a receipt , so buyer beware
big time !
barnes & noble nook color ebook reader tablet ( wifi only ) w/ sandisk 1gb microsd cardi won not get into all the things this amazing ereader can do
you can read all the other <NUM> star reviews for these details
but here is a really important one that shouldn not be overlooked when considering the purchase of an ereader
on the nook , you can read thousands of free fiction and books ( from most local libraries ) that are in the epub format
the kindle cannot do this .
the nook color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows
the hardware on the nook color is very nice
the screen , though not a super retina like high end tabs , is bright and great for books , video , comics , etc
it feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy
a nice addition is the sd card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or , if you are resourceful ( or purchase a nook <NUM> android card ) convert your nook into a android tablet on the cheap
the interface in the nook color is adequate but not amazing
barnes and noble created their own "flavor" of android for this reader
while it is not highly customization or super elegant it is well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet : media consumption
as noted above , this reader can run full android quite well if modded , and still run a nook app
lackluster appsapp support for this reader is very spartan
you will find some simple games , netflix ( finally ) and a few others , but it is not a lot to write home about
if you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading , this isn not a bad buy if you can get one at a good price ( i wouldn not pay more than <NUM> at the moment )
otherwise , it is a great android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a nook <NUM> android card ) .
the new nook "simple touch" is easy on my eyes for long reading sessions
the nook makes it easy to chose a font style , a font size , single spacing or double spacing
you can customize the appearance of the text to your needs
it is easy to read the nook indoors with any decent room lighting , and easy to read outdoors in the shade
it is july in texas
so i have not tried using it in direct sunlight
the nook is easy and comfortable to hold in one hand for extended periods of time
turning pages is easy with a light touch on the side of the screen or a press of the page button in the sideframe
the battery took a couple of full charge/discharge cycles to stabilize
at that point , it was using about <PERCENT> of the battery for each hour or two of reading
reading an hour or two hours a day and using the an hour or two per week would result in <NUM> weeks or <NUM> weeks per charge
in contrast , my color requires charging each day
magazines look much better on my color , but magazine text is very readable on the nook
the nooks is at its best with a book with plain text , as illustrations , art , drawings , etc
look crude compared with a color
i have several books in paperback at home that i also have on the nook
because i can increase font size and use on the nook , it is much easier to read on the nook than in the paperback book
my aging eyes feel much better after a couple hours with the nook than after a couple hours straining to read the "fine print" that is typical of lower priced paperback books
if you want an primarily for magazines , you probably should buy the nook color or a small color tablet
if you will be reading books , you will like the nook simple touch
look around and compare price
the price of the nook varies widely between stores .
i bought three of these
i was very very happy of the performance with the original 1
1 firmware
however , two of them already upgraded to the 1
0 firmware , which immediately erased the ability to use the "look" functions as internet browser
one of the readers frost during update and it doesn not recognize the "nook" menu button anymore
i will return it , luckily it is within the original retail return period
the second reader seems ok
it is less responsive now though , after the "upgrade"
will test it with imported through callibre books tonight , if it is still ok after firmware update
the third reader hasn not updated yet , i don not know why
i will return it anyway - i don not want to take the risk
conclusion : b&n ; completely ruined otherwise not bad reader by buggy and restrictive firmware update
it is definitely not worth the money right now
i have the first generation nook too , and in general i preferred nook due to the epub support
i integrated with callibre and used embedded fonts for epub books
i promoted my nook readers to friends until this firmware update , because of the ok hardware and epub support
however , considering that b&n ; is much less popular than its competitor , and popularity means software and application support , and it has no text or word doc files support , and being extremely restrictive in order to not allow direct internet access to competitive or free content , i am strongly not recommending purchase of the device
it is ok if given free for a brand new unit .
i recently bought a nook and when i bought it home for the first time , i was impressed
the user interphase ( much improved over nook 1st gen ) was optimized for the large touchscreen and is much better than the simple list ui of the new kindle touch
holding the device was also pleasant and the page turn buttons were a great addition that the kindle touch desperately lacks
hardware and software wise , the product itself is perfect as a functional and easy to use
however , when i started to look for books to purchase ( they were about investing if you were curious ) , out of the five books i tried to find , i ended up only being able to find one of the books i wanted
i purchased this device having read half a dozen reviews , and the reviewers all commented on how comparable the book selections for amazon and barnes and noble are , but the truth is , b&n ; still has a ways to go
i am aware the the nook supports which allows it to read generic pdf files ( something that the kindle can not do ) , but one of the features i look for in is convenience
having to buy a book from google books on my laptop and then transferring it to my nook is not convenient
if only this device had the kindle store on it
bottom line : when you buy an , you are also buying into the manufacturer is entire ecosystem
with the kindle , you are buying material from an expanding and reliable retailer that is not going away anytime soon
with the nook , you are buying material from a reputable but inconsistent company whose mettle has yet to be tested in the space
two word recommendation : research selection ( before purchase ) i hope i have helped .
i am so pleased with my new nook touch
i have already purchased <NUM> books and am reading them all
the best part is that there are so many good books that are free ( even one ot/nt free bible ) and most others are under $10
there is also the ability to read samples of books before you buy without going out of the house because the nook has
i really like everything about it , especially the fact that there is a battery that can be changed by b&n ; or by me after the warranty is out and the ability to visit b&n ; store for help
i would highly recommend .
for what i wanted it to do , namely display some of the pdf files and books that i already have on hand , this does a pretty poor job of it
the default software is not compatible with many useful formats such as txt or rtf
there is no folder view for displaying the books you put on it , you are constrained to a library view that tries to sort everything for you
the settings page is a joke , there is almost no customization to be had there
the shop is main view was nonfunctional out of the box ; every time i tried to access it , it kicked me back out to the main page , and i had to access it by going to the "top 100" page instead , and even then the search would sometimes not work
the battery capacity went down <PERCENT> over <NUM> days , so i don not think that it would make the <NUM> month mark that it should have
for all of it is failings , it gets much better once it is rooted , as underneath it all , it is still an android 2
1 device
once that happens , you have access to the android market , email , web browser , and more importantly , you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader
you can even put amazon is android kindle reader on it as well
the reason for the relatively low rating is that all of these features and functionality should have been unlocked by default
the default software that comes with it feels unfinished and lacking in features to me , and it seems like b&n ; were just being lazy when putting it together
rooting it is also a pain , and even though there are some rough edges in a fully unlocked android os on an eink interface , i still think that it is better than the default software
i would rate this as 4/5 if it came unlocked by default .
haven not had it but a few weeks , but i am learning how to download from the library , etc
love how light it is and that it will tuck away in a purse for easy reading anywhere
no operating problems so far
would recommend it for home or away&<HASHTAG> ;
product shipped quickly , and arrived slightly ahead of schedule , even from the other side of out country
the stated storage capacity is rather misleading
it says 2gb , but half of that seems reserved for the system , and most of what is left is reserved for b&n ; is ebooks
that leaves about 250mb for the rest of your library
fortunately , a 4gb microsd card cost me a measly $5
even better , memory card integration is seamless
amazon is got a great price , too
$10 cheaper than anyone else
ironic , considering the nook is their direct competitor
one thing to take into consideration is that the page numbers are synced with the actual pages of the ebook , regardless of font size or line spacing , so you can turn through page <NUM> two or three times before getting to page 86
it is a little weird , but not a major issue
i got my paws on one of these things in the store , and i am still surprised at how light and small it is
the last consideration ( not really an issue , but an odd choice on their part ) is the lack of a file manager on the device
you have to plug the nook into a computer to delete files
however , it is irrelevant , since all of my ebooks are on the memory card , and i bought a usb adapter for that very reason
all in all , this is a fantastic product , and i am very pleased with it .
here is my take on nst : this is a very nice , but very limited reader
i love the display
that is it
a real home run ? not quite
quick summary is that they won not sell me any other unit with an lcd ( i spend all day looking at one of those , i don not want another one for my )
i might as well use my netbook or go all the way to a real tablet , and that won not be from b+n
here are the problems with the whole nook thing
( 1 ) you can not use it for a pdf , magazine , or anything with graphics because you cannot zoom or rotate
i have purchased some books with pictures and figures that you can not see
guess they want you to get the color nook , huh ? nope , not going there ( see above )
( 2 ) you cannot share books
yeah , yeah , they say you can , but that is very limited and makes no sense
( if the publishers trust them enough with their drm to have the book at all , why can not you transfer the book to someone else using the same drm ? ) i can get a paperback , read it , and share it forever
not so with nook and you know it
( 3 ) b+n ( and everybody is ) cost the same as a new paperback , even though the seller didn not incur any cost of printing , shipping , inventory , etc
but i can get a paperback for <PERCENT> off at my local kroger grocery store for new releases and best sellers , or i can go down to the used book stores and find quite a few titles at <PERCENT> ( or more ) off list
when everybody in my family has read that book , i can sell it to the used book store for <PERCENT> or <PERCENT> of list value
that is a
so , where is the advantage with a nook other than it is cool ? three strikes ( it could get one more if you count fragility compared to a paperback book )
this whole thing is at this point
that is my $0
just wish i had known this before i spent the hundred dollars .
ok , i got this thing and plugged it in as instructed , to which it responded by doing nothing
after some further research , i found that it likes to be updated
i followed the instructions on the nook website and downloaded the newest version and
the little monster came back just as dumb as before
it does show cute screens , but not yet anything productive
so far , not impressed .
i bought this from b & n and had to return it back in june and they have still not credited me for the return
i have called them at least ten times over the past two months and have been on the phone at least two to thee hours each time and they have still not credited me yet for the nook touch
i am now forced to report it to my credit card company and hopefully they can get some where with them
buyer beware where you buy your nook touch .
i must admit i was a skeptic regarding ebooks
i thought nothing could beat a good ole paperback in my hand
after purchasing <NUM> of these for my wife and i on a whim i have to admit , i love it
allows me to read books more quickly , not sure why , faster page turning , easier to find where you left off , maybe easier to read for longer periods of time , easier to carry with you anywhere maybe ?
adjustable font size so you don not have to squint at small print , display is just like a real page , and you can flip pages with a swipe , a touch , or using the buttons on either side
i can not compare it to a kindle because i never owned one , but my understanding is that it allows more formats than the kindle does
so simple to transfer books from my computer , or purchase books via wifi at b&n ; or at home , or even borrow from my local library online ! can not say enough great things about it , my wife and i were thrilled with them , not really any cons , wifi is difficult to connect in some places , thats pretty much it
i purchased the kindle ( ) and the original nook ( the b&w ; one ) and tried them out during the return period
while there were things about the kindle i really liked ( features that other reviewers on the kindle site had written ) , the one thing that made me choose the nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library
haven not been back to the library since ! now here comes the nook simple touch reader ( nook str )
i got one via when they came out in early june
it has the same pearl screen as the kindle , so the screen contrast is no longer an issue
and wow , has the user interface improved over the original nook ! ( which i thought was clunky ) the entire pearl screen has full touchscreen capability
on both the kindle and the original nook , i felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read , instead of using the buttons ( on the kindle ) or the lcd touchscreen ( on the original nook ) to highlight and select the desired ebook
on the nook str , the library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device ( both library and purchased )
touch the icon , and the ebook opens
turning the page ? touch the screen on the right side of the page ( to go forward ) or the left side ( to go back )
or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page
or use the buttons built into the frame
want to page quickly through a book ? hold down the page turning button
need a word definition ? touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up
the user interface resembles that of an iphone or ipad , with the icons , virtual keyboard and the physical home button
it even has the "slide to unlock" feature like the iphone
the touchscreen on the nook str is infrared ( it senses the heat of your finger , again like iphone ) , so a light touch works just fine
i found that on the original nook , sometimes it would take multiple touches on the lcd screen for the device to recognize a command
in response to the reviews about the touchscreen ceasing to respond , the nook str i had suffered from that problem
the touchscreen would become slow to respond , and eventually quit working altogether
a power cycle generally brought it back
i started a thread on b&n ; is website about this and found many others having the problem
i did take my nook str back to b&n ; and they exchanged it
have had the replacement nook st for six weeks now and the problem hasn not returned
so don not be spooked about buying one due to this problem - if it happens to you , exchange it
going back to library books , i had to install adobe digital editions onto my pc ( my library had the link to download - free )
this software allows you to manage your ebooks on your nook
the nook str is a good choice for seniors that may not have extensive computer skills
using the device is easy enough , but loading books from a library website ( via adobe digital editions ) requires a few steps to complete
if help is needed , it can be a positive experience
one last plus - once you get your nook str , check the "shop" tab to access b&ns ; website
every friday b&n ; offers a free book for download , and has discounts on other days of the week .
the reason ill take a eink reader over a kindle eink reader , is because the nook has expandable memory ( up to 32gb )
when you get to the fire and nook color/tab its a different story
the simple touch is light weight and the battery life is amazing
if you just need an ereader with out browsing the web this is perfect
feels great in the hand , the screen size is just right and loading books are very easy
although if you can afford a simple touch with glow i would say get that one for the light
the only thing you have to get use to is the screen being a little jumpy when you switch from one thing to another
i believe its because of the eink style .
 ( i am writing my review in amazon because b&n ; "block" my review arguinf it violates the terms of use of b&n
; ironic don not you think : / , anyway this is my original review of the ebook reader ) the readers is fine in general : pros : - nice physically materials- best graphic user interface than kindle- nice screen- great speed of screen refreshing- touch screen response is wonderfulcons : - physically buttons for back and forward are kind of hard to press- no landscape mode
i don not understand why : ( - no web browser or rss reader app or something like that- pdf reader usually do not render properly if the pdf has tables , bullets , images and other graphic different from text
- you can not delete , move or rename files from the device user interface , you always have to connect it to the computer to do this actions
this makes you waist a lot of time
- the device has a hidden partition used to store the books you purchased at b&n ; store
you cannot have access to that partition ( with or without computer ) in order to delete this purchased books
- you can not export your highlight or notes from the books
kindle is a step forward with this "most have" feature
- the reader does not have the option to lock the screen with a secret password or dots combinations like android phoness
remember that you have stored your credit card inside the account of the device ! - the home screen lacks the options for fold or expand the <NUM> sections : reading now , library and next readings .
i have had this a few days and i love it ! it arrived earlier than expected which is a plus ! i have never had a nook before so i am unsure whether my problem is an issue with my nook or all nooks but the power/sleep button on the back is loose feeling and is hard to press
other than that , i have barely put this thing down since it arrived ( : good thing i am on winter break from school !
we have only been using the product for a couple of weeks now , but it is working great
my wife and my daughter both love it and find it very easy to use .
i enjoyed the original nook
i thought this would be a great device , especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites
i have had the nook ( 3 of them , actually ) and am returning it before my <NUM> day window is up
first , the buttons are annoying to use
i like having the option to tap the screen , but i'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible
simply hard to press the buttons down
they don not seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book
second , and most importantly , is the contrast and quality of the screen
different letters are darker than others on every page , within words , and they change every time i go to the next page and back
i thought it might have just been something weird with the files , or formatting , so i played around and did the troubleshooting
it is just horrible to look at
after having <NUM> with the same problem , i am going to just send it back
no need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service
it is too bad ; i really wanted to support barnes and noble by using their reader
note : i put this review on the b&n ; site , and they removed it for somehow violating their terms
well , okay then .
unboxed the nook
charged it up
won not connect to my wifi network when three laptops in my house will
and it won not work at all until you register it
posts on the internet say its a complex technical issue
i am calling the b&n ; tech people
if they can not fix it fast then this thing is going back
i didn not sign up for hours of struggling with nook is technical problems
i have better things to do
update : customer service didn not help
took it to barnes & nooble store but the battery had drained in less then a week so they couldn not look at it
i figured if the battery can not hold a charge for that long than i didn not want the device
the seller agreed to take it back for a restocking fee and i had to pay for shipping
this thing cost me time and money , a bad experience all around
i will never buy a b & n product again , certainly not from a third party seller
i have ordered a sony reader directly from sony
hopefully i will have better luck
we bought one of these for my hoping to get her a piece of technology that would be enjoyable for her to use
it has been nothing but a pain
her main thing she uses it for is reading books from the library
this requires a process that involves going through hoops , a computer , and an adobe id and software
having experience with an amazon kindle ( the very basic one ) and ipads with library books , this was an absolute pain and i feel bad for my
what should be a step process is way more complex and requires special software on the computer to transfer the ebook to the nook
there have been several occasions where my ( who is ok with technology ) has called up and spent hours on the phone with my husband trying to figure out how to get a book onto the nook
i would not recommend this unless you plan to purchase only from the nook itself
otherwise , it is nothing but frustrating .
first let me qualify my comments
if you are looking for an all purpose epad or ipad alternative , buy another product ! that is clearly not what barnes and noble designed this unit for
it is not intended to surf the web , check email , etc
it is an ereader
period ! having said that , in my opinion , it is the best out there right now
it is incredibly light weight - much lighter than even a typical paperback
it is easy on the eyes for extended reading periods and can be read in basically every lighting situation you could read a real book
the clarity is sharp but not overpowering on the eyes like an lcd type display is after a few hours
the battery life is insane
if you turn off wifi , which should be normal unless you are looking for another book , the battery doesn not need recharging for weeks on end
page turning is a simple touch to the left or right of the screen
assignable buttons are also provided for pagination but they require a rather firm press
i found most of the time i don not use them
it has a very responsive touch screen for all your navigation
i had a 1st generation nook and this one is far easier to navigate through books which is a big plus for bibles or reference books
it reads epub format so more than half of what i read comes from the public library
it is not going to be great for color magazines and so on
you will need a nook color or an epad like xoom or ipad for that
but the downside with those is that the lcd type display cannot be read in direct sunlight so good luck at the beach or pool
one nice feature i use now and then is the dictionary
if you come across a word you are unfamiliar with you just touch it and up pops an option look it up
i think barnes and noble has a winner here .
i purchased <NUM> of these in november of 2011
we had a baby on the way and i anticipated lots of reading time
they were so inexpensive i got one for me & one for my wife
i find the reading experience with the simple touch great
the pearl display has great contrast , and pages turn pretty quickly
i keep the wifi off and battery life is really good
i don not think it is quite as good as bn claims ( 2 months reading time ? ) but i can go weeks without charging
i have only purchased a few books though the bn store , i mostly them using calibre , which works great
my wife doesn not read hers as much as i read mine , and the touchscreen on hers will go unresponsive
holding down the "n" button on while holding down the top back button forces it to rebook and come back to life
it hasn not been a major issue though
i purchased averso arc light for kindle , nook , & other ereaders - blackand it works well for reading in situations
the simple touch with glowlight wasn not an option when i bought mine
overall it is a great , versatile , light small .
i just received this reader after returning a gifted kindle
nice screen and seems much more white than the kindle touch i returned
i did root it to run android , so it tends to lag in apps that it was never meant to run , but in reader apps , it is great
it also has a micro sd slot ( 32gb works fine ) which is the main reason i chose it
that and the fact that it is so easily rooted , with a large support community
i liked the kindle is sleek looks more than the nook , but the screen on this is definitely better for reading ( can not speak for the new kindle paper white )
i haven not read outdoors with it yet , so no info there
now i have a ton of ebooks and , more importantly , all my college text books in pdf format
in fact now that it is rooted , i can read any format file by getting an app ( including the kindle app ! )
web browsing is okay with opera mobile
email is great
video is not possible , but eink offer a couple of months of battery life ( even a few weeks would be great ) which makes up for any shortfalls
i leave my laptop home most days now
bottom line : it is the perfect addition to the modern student is toolkit ( if you have got a little technical ) .
i will make it simple
i loved my nook
i bring to school every single day and have books on there
it is great because it is light , it is portable ( it fits in my pocket ! ) , and most importantly , it has all my books at once
it can most definitely be read in direct sun , and i was pleasantly surprised that barnes and noble did not lie in the slightest when they advertised no glare
you can side load any pdf or epub file , as well as downloading books from the store
the book management is simply fantastic
the reading quality is also great because you can change font size as well as the font itself
however , on day i picked it up and i couldn not unlock it
i wasn not very worried , because the nook occasionally doesn not respond to touch because the infared sensors are blocked by dust and dirt
but it still wouldn not respond after cleaning it as well as five hard reboots , which were the only thing the bn support line could offer
i feel dissapointed but ordered the new glowlight and hope that it will last longer , because it was just great while it lasted
i hope you have a better experience with your nook- if , that is , you decide to buy this older model .
i have had my nook simple touch for a few weeks now- i previously owned a sony reader pocket edition , and i own a ipad
this device fills a niche- if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things , get a tablet or the ipad or the kindle fire
this device is designed to read books , and it does a beautiful job at it
i purchased my sony reader expecting to be able to add comments in it , but it was way too difficult , and ultimately i decided to purchase an ipad
like the sony reader , the nook can take notes but wouldn not be a great device to purchase for that purpose
it was pretty easy to set up- i didn not read the instruction manual , but i usually don not
i just followed the on screen instructions to connect it with my internet , my barnes and noble account , and then plugged it into my computer to sync it with library books
i had a bit of trouble connecting it with my internet , but that has happened with every new device i have purchased , so i think its my internet is fault , not the nook
i went through the steps a few times and then it started worked
i really like holding it to read- i generally read ridiculously thick books , so its nice to have something small and light to hold instead of a massive book that i have to prop up ( and its so much nicer to read from than an ipad- the ipad is fine to read from , and i never seemed to feel screen fatigue , but it is way too heavy to hold with one hand )
initially i didn not realize that the two buttons on either side of the screen move the page forward or back , so i was touching the screen each time- the delay time is a bit longer that way , and it was annoying to have to use both hands
as soon as i realized that the buttons existed , the experience got even better
the battery life seems great- i charged it all the way up using my power adapter that i have for my iphone/ipad , and it worked great
i haven not had to charge it again , and i have been reading for about an hour each day
the one thing that surprised me and was frustrating for a few minutes was when i realized that i couldn not load my other epub books onto the nook because there wasn not enough room
the advertised size of the nook is 2gb , which is a ton of books , but it wasn not enough room for the books i have acquired through other sources- like google book downloads
a quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble
fortunately there is an easy solution- there is a slot for a microsd card , and i happened to have a 2gb one lying around- plus they only cost about $5 , if that
i popped it in , turned the device off and on , and i was ready to go again
not a by any means , but something to consider if you are planning to add your own epub library to your nook
kindle vs
nook- i haven not owned a kindle , only used it for a few minutes , but my personal opinion as i decided which to purchase was this : price was important ( and i got a great black friday deal on the nook ) , and since they were about the same price i wanted to support the more open epub format , since you can load books from other sources
yes , its possible to convert epub to kindle format but its an extra step that many people won not be interested in
i would have purchased the kindle with special offers , and hadn not thought much about it , but i have enjoyed the pictures of authors that show up on my nook screen , and would probably get annoyed by the commercials/make a point to put my nook in a case so i didn not have to see them
durability- i haven not abused it by any stretch of the imagination- yet- but it did take a fall off a coffee table and didn not crack/break/show any sort of damagei will update my review as i have more time to play with it in the next few months
the "newest model" is the nook simple touch with glowlight , and not this model
it may be the newest without a light , but it is not the "newest" .
great product , easy to use and set up--after comparing pros and cons this was the one for me
i especially liked that i could download books from my community library and other sites
i wasn not tied just to a brand name download
shipped quickly too .
satisfied with this purchase
the nook was brand new in an open box
works like a gem
very happy customer !
i bought this to replace a sony that i thought was too heavy and too slow in the page turning
yes , the nook is quicker on the page turning and lighter but i am having too much trouble to appreciate faster and lighter
i am having an infinite amount of trouble getting library books onto the nook - i have yet to succeed and the problems lie with adobe digital editions
why aren not nooks plug and play ? that is my first big problem
i have no problem with my sony and the library book i wanted is now on my sony
the second is that i like to read while i am eating my lunch - ereader in left hand and fork in right
it is not easy to change the page on the nook while eating - the bottom right corner is too far from my thumb and the bottom buttons are too high up the side
the sony has a set of buttons right in the bottom center , which is perfect placement
i read the great reviews on the nook and for the price , i thought it was worth a try
i am also disappointed with the wifi registration requirement and wifi in general
i don not need wifi on my ereader but it looks like they are all offering it now
i also don not appreciate my registration info being used by b&n ; as permission to start emailing me crap - i am already unsubscribed from that iservice'
i am definitely not happy with the nook and i am going to save up my money to buy another sony
*update 5/25/13* i finally was able to download library books onto my nook but it was frustrating and time consuming ; i finally found help online
i have yet to discover a way to comfortably hold this book in my left hand and turn the page
this was a very bad buy for me
i bought a cover for it and that was a waste of money as well as i find the cover just gets in the way
i did not know how good i had it with the sony and will continue to use my sony instead of the nook
i don not recommend the nook at all .
price : nook - cheaper or same price as kindle with ads
screen : nook ( barely ) - same screen nook software makes slightly better typeface
ebook format : nook - supports more popular epub vs kindle support of mobi
other document formats : kindle - supports
doc ,
txt , &
rtf ; nook doesn not
borrowing from library support : nook - better for now , but popularity of kindles and amazon marketing may change that , time will tell if libraries start purchasing kindle only ebooks
other paid book sources : nook - can read books purchased from other ebooks stores like google , sony , etc
kindle can not
user interface : nookbells & whistles : kindle - text to speech is incredibly helpful for dyslexics and others
plays mp3s
is pretty cool
connectivity : kindle - for an additional $50 you can get a kindle with 3g
page turns : nook - slightly faster .
let just start off by saying that i have tried the kindle and although an ok hardware device , the interface was terrible
it felt like the early days of the internet , with textual interfaces , underlined words , fiddling with buttons and keyboard to navigate , and all sorts of annoyances that got in the way of reading and enjoying the device
we returned it within <NUM> days
next we tried the original nook black&white ; , and interface was much better , but the screen had poor contrast
( not the nice pearl screen as the kindle has ) enter nook touch
this thing has a top notch interface
they totally put their minds and heart into this one
it is perfect
touchscreen makes a world of a difference , and enables the slick interface that allows you to browse the store , personal library , and more
buttons and finger gestures make the magic happen , and this is one device you are sure to love to use
the screen is the new pearl , so it looks just as good as the kindle , with the added benefit of touchscreen ! the size ? perfect ! not too big , not too small
very thin
well built
feels durable
all i can say is this is finally the ereader i have been waiting for
excellent battery life , good pearl screen , touchscreen , and perfect size
to boot , the price is dead on ! $139 with wifi
if it gets stolen , i am buying another one immediately !
very very good value for this reader , and i am grateful for the quick exchange they made when the first unit developed a problem right away
they immediately sent a replacement
immediately .
this a second generation
by adding a <NUM> gb micro sd card , it can store more than i will ever own
most of my books are in pdf format
it has trouble displaying charts or images and fails totally to display an in pdf form that i bought from forbes
all these books display properly in pdf readers available on personal computers
it is other weakness is that it has minimal documentation
the topics are covered but the explanaitons leave the user with a lot of questions .
wife bought this for her elderly mother - but she couldn not quite get the hang of using it ( tech challenged )
my wife has been using it instead and seems to like it pretty well
all is good : )
this is the third ebook reader i have used and definitely the best
the franklin ebookman had nice hardware but dreadful firmware with more bugs than you would find in a swamp in summer
the ectaco jetbook lite had a number of glitches in its firmware as well , plus an extremely upgrade method
i did encounter one major problem with this nook simple touch -- the life of a battery charge was nowhere near the several weeks promised ( with wifi off )
fortunately , however , i called b&n ; customer service , and they advised me to install the latest firmware , v1
1 , which addresses the power issue
the upgrade proceeded easily and without glitches , and it seems to have solved the problem ; though i haven not put the duration of a battery charge to the full test yet , the charge indicator is holding at <PERCENT> after a full day , including more than an hour of reading
that compares very favorably to the <PERCENT> discharge rate i had been experiencing in just three days using the old firmware
i will report back if the battery problem returns
otherwise i prefer the nook simple touch is ergonomics to the comparable kindle
the nook is front is all screen , with no unnecessary keyboard keys
virtual keyboard keys appear onscreen when you need to search for something
the unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts , and it is trim and lightweight
there are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen , making for easy operation in a subway
you have a choice of font styles and sizes , and the screen is easy to read even under bright sunlight
you can touch any word onscreen to get a quick dictionary definition ( provided , i found , that the word isn not hyphenated and run on two lines )
i like the ease with which you can download titles from the public library ( you download to adobe digital reader , which your library provides free , and then transfer the epub books to your nook with the usb cable provided )
the program recognized my nook without any glitches
i also like being able to read any book for an hour a day free at the nearby b&n ; store
newbies should note that , in their apparent effort to keep the nst instructions short and simple , b&n ; left out a few useful ones
notably : to close one book ( so you can open another ) , press the nook button below the screen ( the thing that looks like an u ) and enter "library
" to lock the nook immediately , without waiting for it to enter sleep mode , press the power button on the back briefly
and to tell when the nook has finished charging , wait for the little led next to the usb input on the unit to turn from amber to green
so if you have been looking for an ebook reader offering great value and ergonomics , take a look at this nook
but make sure to upgrade to firmware v1
1 or higher ! ) update : trust me to find the bugs in an ebook reader -- or perhaps they find me
at any rate , i bought a copy of the american heart association cookbook ( 7th edition ) and was dismayed to see some of the fractions describing quantities in recipes replaced by question marks ! i emailed b&n ; customer support , and they suggested that i try downloading the title again ( which you do by archiving and unarchiving a title , whatever that means )
that didn not work , but i found that if i clicked the check box on the font selection screen marked "publisher is default" ( or words to that effect ) , that seemed to solve the problem
so if you are seeing question marks in any titles where numbers should be , try that solution ! i sure love beta testing new products for these big companies -- not !
gave this to my granddaughter , who loves it
she uses it all the time and loves the touch feature and ease of downloading .
the device itself is amazing
-great touchscreen reading looking design , small because there is no keyboard to make it bigger and it is smaller than the original formats natively that the kindle won' all the ebooks you want in b&n ; stores for checkouts are and hold on a word to get its and take notes in a book easily
but when you root the thing it gets even better ! -install the gmail app to get your the opera browser ( supports flash ! ) -install the kindle app and you can read kindle ebooks it in host mode to attach an external sure to get the home button savior app so you can switch back and forth between the b&n ; reader and the rest of the device is functionality
i used these instructions : [amazon removed my link
google "root nook touch using touchnooter & install go launcher , nookcolor tools , gmail , market & youtube" , it is the top link
]i will be buying lots of these as gifts , and i am going to root them all ! this is a perfect device for hackers and regular ebook readers too ! what is a kindle ? never heard of it .
i don not read a ton so i didn not want to pay a huge premium for an
i have an ipad but when i do read , sometimes staring at that screen for more than an hour can give me a headache
it came down to this , the basic kindle , and the new kindle paperwhite
when i really thought about it , the paperwhite was more than i really wanted to spend on something i would only use an hour or <NUM> a week
i ultimately decided to get this because it could read epub files natively and didn not have to be converted to mobi files which the kindle uses
it wasn not quite as straight forward as i was expecting
i initially thought it'd be like the ipad where you just drag the book into the books section of itunes and you are ready to go
i dragged the books onto the nook when it appeared on my desktop and nothing happened
i found out you had to download ade and set it up that way
from there you have to add the books to ade then add them to your nook , not a huge deal , but a few extra steps compared to the ipad
i also noticed that scrolling between pages had a bit of delay compared to the ipad and that when you were trying to use the scroll bar to advance more than a few pages at a time , it wasn not the most accurate
it also appears that page sync only works with content you purchase from them and not files you have already on your computer ( i think the kindle is the same way as well though )
the reading experience is great though
its not too bright and easy on the eyes
the nook itself is pretty light so its not a hassle to hold it for awhile
library is also easy to scroll through once its on your device
overall i am happy with it
i mentioned its shortcomings , but they don not outweigh how easy it is to read and the overall reading experience
from a reading standpoint i'd give it <NUM> stars , just some other things that popped up that aren not big deals , but noticable
i'd recommend this to anyone like myself who doesn not do a ton of reading , but still wants a simple
if you are a more serious reader , i'd probably spring for the paperwhite .
i dont know why i bought this tablet , just only one day using it and i stored it in a place where it continues stored
i dont like the screen
it reflects light from many sources ( sun , bulbs , etc ) despite the type of technology used in the screen
the size is no convenient , i think a bigger one good be better
well , this is my opinion about this product .
i have gone thru a lot of reviews of this ebook before ordering it , mainly due to its long battery life
within a week , it got shipped home ( excellent seller )
however , the product itself is far from being a good ebook reader
i have had two : one kindle ebook reader ( with keyboard ) and one 10
2" android tablet that i used as a reader mainly
the nook is cumbersome : the bads : 1 ) the first thing it ask for is to read some kind of agreement , then click accept ! ( like i am installing a new software ! ) 2 ) the second thing is to setup for a wifi access , i have troubled to enter the password for my home wireless so it sits there for one day
can not do anything until wifi access is established
the goods3 ) i went to a local b&n ; store to get instant wifi access which i did , the bad4 ) then create an account , enter my credit card number ( why do i need to do this at this time )
should only ask when i first order something from b&n
; the good : 5 ) now i can copy my ebook in pdf formats to it , this part is straightforward
the bad : 6 ) i opened one of my pdf doc and it came up with a huge font size7 ) try to touch the screen to get to a menu allowing me to change font size , the menu appears , then quickly disappears
i was very frustated trying to get the menu display to stay there8 ) it took me a few mins before i can get the menu to be stable , then change to a smaller size
the text now reads fine
but the "next page" , "previous page" buttons are too hard to push , it takes a hard push to get it to work
9 ) i close the document and try to open another one , it won not open10 ) try to the first one , not open eitherfrom this point on , it simply refused to open any document i have on it
11 ) i even convert one pdf to epub format ( specifically target the nook ) and load on it , does not open either
and the epub size is much larger than pdf size ( i
i will have a lot less books on it )
to me , this ebook is useless , so i am going to return it back today
and this is not due to ( or lack of ) my high tech proficiency ( i develop firmware for "firwmare operated" gadgets by trade , really know how to use these "software/firmware" operated gadgets quite well , have at least <NUM> gadgets with very complicated functionalities at home , all of them require patient readings thru their thick manuals to operate / setup to my liking , no problem at all )
i have written quite a lot of product reviews on amazon , most of the gave good rating because these products are good
i feel really frustrated with this one , the first bad review i wrote
my older two ebook readers work right of the box
just copy the documents to it and open to read them
i will never buy these kinds of ebook readers anymore , not even the new kindle as i heard they will show ads on the screen and the kindle fire will just immediately buy stuff from amazon if i accidently click on some place , it does not even show a confirmation screen ( too greedy to make money ) ! i don not buy something to read these ads
amazon and b & n are too greedy trying to push stuff on the users as they feel like , at the users expense
i will try to get a new android tablet instead ( for reading , and internet browsing )
rather spend a few hundreds bugs to get a good product than a cheap one that does not work
many users were lucky to get the ones that work ( touch scree sensitivity seems to be the key here ) , i was not and don not want to try my luck with it again .
i bought this nook simple touch on amazon
com , but when i received it , the wifi would not connect
i tried my home network as well as several wifi hot spots around town
barnes & noble customer service was no help , telling me that , since i did not purchase the nook simple touch from b&n ; , they could not help me , and suggesting that i needed to return it to the seller
i did return it , thinking it was damaged somehow , and the seller graciously gave me a full refund with no argument ( kudos to him and amazon ! )
later , i bought one from b&n ; , and it had the same problem
again , b&n ; customer service was no help , but did send a replacement
the replacement has the same problem and will not connect to wifi
now , i am arguing with b&n ; for a full refund
most of the reviews are glowing
but what they don not say is that b&n ; has this wifi connectivity problem very commonly with the nook simple touch
even the b&n ; forum has many references to the problem
i am not saying that you should not buy one of these nook simple touches , and maybe you will not have the same problem
just beware
caveat emptor !
this arrived as described , packaged well , and worked well
the only issue i have ever had with them is its not as user friendly as it could be
i had to go to online blogs to find the rest of the steps to download an ebook
whether it was from barnes and noble or the library .
i previously owned a kindle and loved it , but it kept breaking
i finally gave up in frustration after having it replaced <NUM> times in the first year
i bought the nook simple touch to replace it , and am very satisfied with my purchase
to be honest , the kindle is brighter and easier to read in light
however the nook excels in nearly every other way
1 ) nook is sturdily reliable
i have had no failures with it whatsoever , although i carry it everywhere and use it daily
i do have it in a protective case , but i had my kindle in a protective case and it kept breaking anyway
point : nook
2 ) nook simple touch is smaller and lighter than the equivalent kindle
nevertheless , is ample
3 ) nook is responsive and seems faster at turning pages than kindle
4 ) books download in a blink and are immediately available
this too seems faster than with my kindle
5 ) there are some things i could do with my kindle that i can not do with my nook simple touch , but i don not miss those things
i needed a simple that just plain works and nook simple touch satisfies that need in a very inexpensive way without ads
point : nook
generally , if you are shopping for an inexpensive , simple , i strongly urge you to buy the nook , and not the kindle
i have tried both , and prefer the nook .
bought this as a gift for my husband
he didn not think he would use an
the nook is so easy to set up and use
i have one too and we both read with them all the time .
i bought nook on yard sell for 35$ in great condition
and only later i found how i was lucky
i was a devoted reader of real books all my live and never thought that i will love ebook reader
what i love about nook that i can change size of letters on any e books
for exemple
i download e book pd format i made on my computer for free on kindel reader and cant read e book because prints so small its impossible to read
on kindle reader you can change size of letters e book only if you bought them on kindel store
but not e book you made by yourself
i could not find russian e book on kindle store i would love to read
so i had to go online russian library ; download e book on my computer and convert to pd format by myself + its free
with nook here is not a problem
all my ebooks i can read in print i wish
just love this nook !
this is a great and simple ebook reader
it is light enough that i can hold it in one hand when reading , it is small enough that it is easy to take with me , the battery life is long enough that i forgot where i put the charger , and the screen lets me read for hours on end without eye strain
it does one thing and does it well
get a tablet computer ( i am partial to the toshiba thrive ) if you want to play games , do email , browse the web , do video conferencing , etc .
i have had all the other nook is and this is the first that i truly love
the touch screen is accurate and quick , there is no reflection at all , page turns are quicker than the other nooks
it is very light , the archiving and rating process is much much easier
shopping is easier as well
i am in love with my kindle and always compared the nook , now i love them equally
of all the nooks , i think this is the best one , i love it
i only wish it was 3g
barnes and noble still seems to have an issue with the syncing of books between the readers
when i read on this nook ( just like the other 2 ) , it doesn not sync with online so when i then use my iphone i am not at my current page
in this area , the kindle and amazon know what they are doing
i am not terribly impressed with the choice of covers for this new nook
i am waiting patiently for to release their new covers so that i can use my light with both my nook and kindle .
the device physically , is relatively good for the money
there are many reviews on youtube and other places that address that point
the problem with the b&n ; system is the fact that you must enter a 'default credit card' to be able to use or purchase any books
if you were to buy this nook for your young son or daughter , they would be able to purchase anything at the flick of a finger , and it would charge to your credit card 'for your convenience'
similarly , if anyone found your child is nook , they too could purchase anything using your credit card information
i tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child is account , b&n ; still requires a credit card to be in order to 'unlock' the book
by contrast , with the kindle system , you simply buy a book through amazon using any credit card ( which does not have to stay active ) and send it to an authorized device
the nook system , by comparison , is slow , clunky , and a massive security risk
if you setup the nook and do not provide this credit card during setup , no books can be sent to the nook wirelessly , they must be sync'ed with a cable tethered to a computer
since my <NUM> daughter purchased this herself with her own money , i have no choice but to either tell her to eat the unit or use my credit card without any parental control
furthermore , it would appear that b&n ; is entering into a contract with my minor daughter in this regard
by opting out of this model , you are left with an utterly useless device
why none of the other reviewers elaborate on this is beyond me
i suppose if the device is owned by an adult this model would work , however if you are contemplating this as a gift for your child , i'd avoid any device related to b&n ; altogether
i give them <NUM> starts for the hardware only but otherwise the device , in this case , is useless
while you can delete your credit card from b&n ; , the process is well hidden and you would need to add a card , order , download , sync , unlock , and then delete the card in order to get each purchase on the device
either that or hand your child your visa and tell them to enjoy ! now that is what i call convenience .
it seems to be a limited device , but it has potential i think a good price it new should be about $55
i have one as a backup to my kindle p
w there are two pros , the sd card slot and it can be rooted , but rooting affects battery life and its not stable when rooted
very very limited web browser no facebook or anything useful , the browser on the the paperwhite is much better
it is a pretty well made device
it is a ok back up to my kindle paperwhite .
having previously owned a kindle , i was not expecting that readers had much improved over the last year
contrast on the display was a big problem for me , and i wasn not especially keen that the kindle uses a proprietary book format that cannot be read on other
so , as long as i stuck buying books from amazon for a kindle , i was fine ; the second i ever wanted to move to another device , i couldn not take my books
this didn not sit well with me
when barnes and noble dropped the price of the nook simple touch to $99 i decided to take the plunge
( note that as of this writing , amazon still has not reflected the price drop
) the newer generation screen , while still not perfect , is far , far superior than earlier generations
reading indoors no longer requires a spotlight on the to maintain legibility
anyone who owns an ipad or other tablet knows how intuitive a touch interface can be , so i am delighted to say that the navigation issues previously posed by the joystick on the older kindle are resolved with the nook is new touch interface
amazon released their own touch just recently
while it now brings the kindle in line with the capabilities of the nook , it still lags in one area : proprietary book format
the nook and all other major use epub , a file format for
amazon for its own reasons chooses not to
what this means in practical terms is that you pretty much have to buy all of your books from amazon - and forget about taking them with you if you ever decide another is the better platform for you
i refuse to be a party to that kind of , which is why i am very happy with my nook simple touch .
we have the old nook reader , which we love
we purchased this nook at target for the same price as barnes and noble and amazon
this nook is smaller , which is nice
it has a built in light , which is really nice
and , it is touch screen , which is awesome ! the only flaw i see thus far is that you can not resize the letters
apparently the letters are a standard size , i assume because of the size of the screen ? anyway , i would like to make them smaller so that i can read more before turning the page
however , that is a minor issue and does not deter me from enjoying the new nook tremendously .
while it doesn not have a light and its screen has been far surpassed by other readers throughout the years
however since it uses android you can easily root it and install apps that allows you to read kindle books and pretty much anything else your heart desires
even can play angry birds if you really wanted to .
i have owned my nook for two months now and am very happy with it
my mom owns a kindle , one sister a nook color , another sister a 1st edition nook
so i have seen my fair share of
i did the research before i bought
i actually bought my dad a kindle 3g for father is day
but the light weight of the nook touch was great for me
i have problems with my hands and their abilities , so after a full day of commuting , typing , and writing , they have reached their peak
it was the right choice for me .
my screen stopped working a week out of warranty
apparently , this is a common issue with the nook simple touch
customer service told me that barnes & noble is aware of this issue but they do not plan to repair or replace anything
this is not the way to treat customers
i am canceling all my and i will try a different ereader .
i tried to leave this review at barnesandnoble
com , but they never posted it
oh well
the nook simple touch is a great
if you are looking for a tablet like device to surf the internet and check email , this is not the product for you
the screen is amazing
it looks like you are reading a physical book
i like that you can turn the page by pressing the buttons or touching the side of the screen
either way will be useful depending on how you are holding the book
this is very simple , which i love
one night , i was lying down in bed and went to lay the nook on it is side then immediately jerked it back up before the page orientation changed
then i remembered that it won not do that ; which makes this great for reading no matter what position you may be sitting or lying in
the nook accepts epub books ; which means that you can get books from a variety of stores , not just barnes & noble
i found that between the b&n ; store and google books , you can get all of the classics for free
no reason to pay for one of those ever again
download adobe digital editions to put books on from other places ; including borrowed books from the public library
the nook doesn not handle pdf is well on its own , but there is a work around
download calibre , bring your pdf is into it and then convert them into epubs
once you do that , you will be able to highlight and take notes like you can with the actual books
if you want a simple , the nook simple touch is the best
( fyi : it is costs less on the b&n ; website
let me start off by saying that i am a fan of amazon
in the past month alone , i have made at least <NUM> purchases
i was browsing around just now and decided to see what amazon
com customers thought of my newest electronic device
i was thrilled to see the high rating , but disappointed to see the price ; $40
00 more than the thing costs at b/n since its release last month
amazon , you need to do better here ! now to the product - this is my first and i am certain that i went with the best product for me
as someone who buys a lot of books from amazon , i would have preferred to have bought the kindle , especially since amazon has more of the types of books i read and for much cheaper than b/n , but i just do not appreciate those tiny buttons on the device
i absolutely love my nook simple touch , and i use it for several hours every day
b/n has free fridays - when you can download a featured book for free - , book share -with contacts on your device and social networks , and free reading of selected books when you are in b/n
my understanding is that i can go to local libraries and even borrow my books using my nook ; this may or may not be any special news
the touch screen is a bit sensitive on the device , so if you prefer not to use it , they are also tactile "buttons" that will allow you to change pages
the home screen shows the book you are currently reading and the page number you are on - a few other books in your library , and some suggested readings
you can create shelves that you name on which to house your books by categories
they do not look like physical shelves , rather they are just a grouping of books
without going into more technical stuff that you can read online , i will say that if you are new to and you enjoy touch screens - and you are looking for a product that simply allows you to read - do not hesitate to go into a b/n and try this out
some people buy this expecting it to browse the web ( although it does have a hidden browser that the techies are working to hack ) - play their audio files , when there is not headphone jack ( techies have discovered that it does have bluetooth , however ) , and folks buy this and complain that they do not like how it does not display their magazines in color
it is not meant to do that - it is meant to be solely an enjoyable reading device that does not give you a whole lot of options to be distracted from the task at hand , reading ! this is why i bought it - eventually , i will get a nook color - or a kindle *color* if they come out with one , but for now , i thoroughly enjoy my nook , which has encouraged me to slow down and spend so much more time in the peaceful , leisurely act of reading
in my excitement , i am reading like <NUM> different books at once
that is the great joy of having an - speaking to those who are , just as i used to be , resistant to the craze - there is no more lugging around a bag filled with books , and when i get tired of reading one , another book is just a couple of swipes away
i am learning about how to get all sorts of books for free or low cost , as well as learning how to take advantage of conversion and management tools such as calibre
i am having a blast with this thing ! yesterday , i received a nice leather case for it that i purchased off ebay for a great price
once again , i looked to amazon
com first , but there simply were not good options
i got a black leather caseen case that also came with a screen protector for twenty bucks .
i bought it and love it
the good stuffthe ui is a lot better than the kindle ( i bought one for my brother , so i felt the difference between them ) , it is really confortable to hold and read , the touch is great for navigating between de ui , but the physical buttons are my choice , takes a little time to get used to it because they are not as sensitive as the kindle ones ( that are too sensitive , i mean the basic edition ) , but that is a good thing since i avoid turn pages accidentaly
the structure is lightweight and really confortable , unlike kindle , the frame around the screen es wide enough to put my fingers on it to read ( i have large hands ) , the grip is great thanks to the rubberized exterior
it is a pleasure to read on this thing
the not so good stuffnot sharing on sideloaded content
if i sideload a book from other store , the sharing option gets unavailable
not that many formats
just pubs and pdf
i mostly read pub files , but it would be great if they support other formats too
not "send to" option
in kindle i fell in love with the option to push content to the device via wireless
this thing doesn not have a feature like that , so wifi is not as usable as it is on the kindle
overall a great product , i liked it more than the kindle mainly because is a lot more confortable to read , better ergonomics , and the ui makes it feel a lot better .
this is an update from my initial review
this barnes & noble nook simple touch was advertised by blueproton at amazon as having been marked down from $249
99 to $68
99 , so it certainly seemed like a great deal
it now seems like fraudulent advertising because i have since read that the msrp is $79
99initially i had serious problems with the nook , and requested a refund
the seller , blueproton , refused to take returns or give a refund for it , and directed me to barnes & noble who referred me back to the seller , stating that the seller should refund it within <NUM> days ; at that time i'd only had it a few days
my amazon a to z claim ended with amazon siding with the seller , blueproton because their policy stated that they would not accept returns on nooks - something i did not see when i initially read their policy ! because neither blueproton nor barnes & noble would take responsibility for the defective product , and their attitude was "take the money and run ! " , i am giving the nook a low review although later i found an update for the nook which resolved the problems - with no help or information from either seller or barnes & noble ! i now enjoy using the nook which is so much easier and more comfortable to hold than regular books while reading , and to carry back & forth to work each day or to travel with
i don not like the gray screen which requires you to face the nook towards the light ; and i don not like the glare on the screen from the sun or lights
i have to sit "just so" to read it - which somewhat defeats the idea of portability
overall i do like it , but it needs improvement
my favorite use of the nook is to borrow my local library is digital books using the free overdrive media console software which allows you to select & save your library ( ies ) and to directly access the digital library from it on your pc , and then sideload ( drag & drop ) the borrowed books to your nook ; no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse , borrow or return books downtown , and no more parking hassles ! most of my library is digital books are in epub format which is the native format of the nook
however , as other reviewers have stated , you can still borrow or buy kindle or other formats of digital books and convert them to epub via the free calibre software
borrowed library books can be returned automatically when the loan periods expire , or can be returned manually earlier if you decide not to finish the book during the loan period
ordinarily i don not buy many fiction books because i rarely read any of them more than once
additionally , due to the poor customer service from both amazon ( who owns kindle ) and barnes & noble ( who owns nook ) i am determined to rarely buy any books from either of these companies , and will primarily download either their free books or the library is loan books
the companies want us to buy their ebooks , but won not take responsibility for their , so that infuriates me and alienates me for life
the pros : the low price ; comfort ; convenience ; savings from being able to borrow library books instead of buying something you will only read once ; no clutter of physical books ; easy loaning to friends with a guarantee that they will be returned in <NUM> days ( automatic returns ) ; ability to read multiple formats via conversion in free calibre software
the nook can also read your pdf files/documents from your pc or elsewhere , plus it can use your jpeg files of photos to use as your custom screensavers ; the nook will convert them to b&w
; the cons : plueproton is and barnes & nobles is total lack of responsibility for their defective nooks - why i gave the nook such a low rating ; amazon is siding with blue proton is irresponsible returns policy ; dreary gray screen which makes it difficult to read except in bright lighting ; touch screen not as sensitive and responsive as it should be - often have to touch the screen a few times before getting a response
over all i am pleased with my nook simple touch now that i managed to fix it by myself , but the companies' irresponsible policies have soured me towards them for life .
ordered for a freind
as far as i know , his daughter is happy with it
i guess you could call him .
this is a sold update to the older nook , but gez you have to hit the webs just to find out you need to charge it overnight in a wall plug only before first usage and that it must be turned on before trying to connect to windows
now knowing these two very important points , i can enjoy my &<HASHTAG> ; nook 2&<HASHTAG> ; .
its a good ereader
how it compares to the kindle , i dunno i seen raves and complaints for both
for an ereader i love the nook
- battery life is awesome
would be nice if this was solar powered like calculators
- the display looks great , even in direct sunlight more or less
- the simple touch looks cool , very simplistic
no buttons all touchscreen for the most part
- the extra $40 warrenty guarentees replacement of damaged nook
covers anytype of damage from what i understand
- not as many ccna/cisco books in epub as kindle but the list is growing fast
- no addswhat i dont like ; - only comes with 200mb of internal memory
you have to pick up a microsd card- cant delete files or books , there is simply no option for it
im hoping for a patch
which means you have to plug it in usb and delete stuff from your desktop
its very annoying
what id like to see ; - new screensavers for download- better support for pdf files- ability to read word doc- solar power , geez why not it only makes sense .
i have used the nook touch and the kindle touch/kindle paperwhite extensively and the nook is the best
why ? i am convinced that if anyone prefers the kindle its because they have never tried the nook
or they have friends that used kindle and don not want to venture out on their own
first the nook feels better
it has a soft plastic outside with a curved back that makes holding the device quite pleasant
it has just enough area around the screen that you can hold easily without mistakenly turning pages
and the side page turn buttons are deep enough you won not turn pages by accident
some might not like it because you have to push pretty hard , but that is by design
second the platform is user friendly and great to navigate
third the font choices are better and you get several more to choose from
plus the size options all make sense
for instance on the kindle the couple smallest font sizes are so small i can not see why anyone would use them and to me it is a waste
fourth the buttons are all well placed
fifth there are no ads and you can even upload your own pictures
go try one today
i am fairly confident you will love it
unless you don not .
this thing was a paperweight from the mint i opened it
and the customer service is just awful
it wont let you go any father unless you register the device and since it would not let me do it i could not use it
went back to the kindle
at first i was torn between the nook simple touch and the kindle paperwhite
i chose the nook because of price and the absence of ads while reading a book
i had though that the nook did not have a good dictionary function , but learned otherwise after it is purchase
all one needs to define a word from the dictionary is to place their finger on the word for two seconds and then chose the look up option on the bottom menu displayed on the left
sharp resolution , useful utilities , convenient scrolling functions both off on the side of and on the screen
lightweight , durable and well designed
essay to download free books ( i suggest project gutenberg )
for downloading free books from on line sites or from the library , you will need to download adobe digital edition <NUM> software which is free
i suggest that you purchase additional memory
barnes and noble only allocates 1/4 of a gig out of 2gig for your personal library from non barnes and noble books
one gig for software to run the nook and 3/4 for books purchased from barnes
the best buy for external memory is <NUM> gig
i also suggest that your purchase one casecrown leather regal flip case sold through amazon ; they are high quality for a reasonable price .
i was very hesitant to buy a book reader because i really like holding my books
i changed my mind when i bought a bigger bookcase and filled up immediately
this nook is great
it is so much lighter than my ipad to read with
i find that i use it a lot .
in my opinion , the nook simple touch is the best on the market because
it is simple
no distractions of email or social media , it lets me immerse myself in a book and i love it !
readability in sunlight is super even when the sun is directly hitting the screen ; can not be beat ! the blacks are great and the contrasting white whites really helps these old eyes of mine ! i like the android operation too .
i bought the nook touch instead of the kindle because it was on sale for $75 , which is still alot to pay for something that can only be used to read books
i didn not realize that if you buy books from b&n ; , you can only read them on your nook , and not on anything else
so even though you paid for them , those books really aren not your property
you have no access to them if you don not use their products ! still , i liked the fact that it used epub , and you had a variety of stores you could buy from and also that libraries have more epub books available
however , i just heard that their latest firmware update prevents you from reading any books except those bought from b&n
; if i had known this i never would have bought the nook
it is as consumer as you can get ! really a nasty way to do business
amazon is different
once you buy a book , it is yours
you can read it on any device
when it comes to buying books , amazon is far easier to use and alot more consumer friendly
the kindle is by far a better choice of the two
i am returning the nook after only a week , because this is a frustrating product that doesn not function like it is supposed to do
there are simply too many glitches in how the touch screen works to be reliable
here are the cons : first , it often takes multiple touches to access anything
you touch or swipe the screen , and nothing happens
you try it again , and still nothing
what a joke
second , pages turn mysteriously on their own and without warning , both forward and backward
i am always losing my place when i try to read a book
i have noticed that this happens almost every time you alter the angle of the nook
if you are reclining and turn to adjust the pillow , don not expect to return back to the same page you were on
third , the menu and dictionary are too easy to activate by accident
if you hold the nook too close to the screen , or at the top or bottom , the menu will appear or the dictionary will activate unintentionally
this happens several times an hour
you can not just simply sit down , relax and read unless you sit motionless in a chair and hold it on your lap
last of all , it does not use a standard usb/micro usb cable
the usb connection to the computer is standard , but the micro usb connection to the nook itself is not ! it is thinner and wider
you can only use the cord provided with the nook to connect to your computer to transfer files or charge the batteries
you can not use the standard usb cord that works with all of your other electronic gadgets , like your digital camera or your portable hard drive
so if you need a longer cord , or lose their cord , you are out of luck
talk about a major inconvenience , one that makes zero sense ! pros : i did like that it recharges in under <NUM> hours and that it has a very long battery life .
i know amazon is going to hate me for this but here goes : i used to have a kindle 3
it was great
it made reading a pleasure however there were a couple of things i would have liked to change
i wished that it had a touch screen and that it was smaller
when i saw the nook touch i thought that this is what my kindle should be like
well i decided to buy the nook and i am very , very pleased
i won not go into an in depth review of the device itself
you can find that just about anywhere
what i will say is the touch screen makes things so much easier
i love the on screen virtual keyboard ( like the ipad ) and the fact that it is a lot smaller than the kindle <NUM> but with the same size and quality screen
since giving the kindle to a relative i thought about the books that i already bought from amazon and the fact that i now have to use my android phone to read them since the nook does not read kindle books
or does it ? with a little research i was able to find out how to root my nook touch ( voids your warranty )
now when i turn on the nook , it gives me a dual boot screen ( sort of )
i can go to the android desktop or the the nook screen
using the android desktop which included the android market i downloaded the kindle reading app
i ran that app , logged into my kindle account and now have all my kindle book available on my nook touch
the only thing missing is text to speech but i didn not use that feature anyway
yes it has a web browser , email and all the other android apps available but most look pretty drab on a monochrome device
that isn not why i did this
i wanted a device to read my nook books and kindle books
i now have the best of both worlds .
if you only want to read , this is fine
the newer models access the web , have apps , play games , do email and color
this model is only print and only black and white .
barnes and noble hit one out of the park with this ereader ! compact , great infrared touch screen , microsd card slot , battery life , wifi , support for pdf and epub , and best of all , running android ! the str has already been rooted , and handily runs android and a host of goodie apps - but even if you don not want to crack your unit , you will still enjoy a nice ereader and interface : - fast , responsive , and crystal clear screen - even in sunlight- touch right or left sides of screen to page forwards or backwards - or - use the hardware buttons on the top sides of the frame- use ishelves' to organize your titles- view titles as icons or in a list- insert bookmarks , notes- look up words instantly with its dictionary- change fonts , font sizes on the fly- purchase titles via wifi or copy from your computer- and much more
no ereader is perfect , but this one comes close ; i held off buying one until the market provided lots of choices - and the str is the one i have been waiting for ! btw , if you have an ereader , you should also get the free ebook app , calibre - it is an *essential* ereader companion , and can be used to convert ebooks to nearly any format for nearly all ereaders , include the new nook simple touch !
i love reading , and in a lot of cases i found myself leaving a book at home because i didn not want to carry any heavy things
this is great ! i put in a small 512mb card and now it holds ~50 books ! i gave it <NUM> stars only because the dictionary function isn not very good
i think it has a literal copy of a dictionary , which means it doesn not explain the word fully but still doesn not allow you to search for the meaning of a work in the translation window .
i bought this ereader and the amazon kindle ereader at the same time , so i could compare both together
after about a week i gave the amazon ereader to my nephew and i kept the nook
i am left handed , so holding things in my left hand feels natural to me
i really like how this can be held in the left hand and still have access to forward and back page turn buttons
also , i like that it has a touch screen in addition to the physical buttons as well to turn pages
also , and this was the biggest reason i kept the nook
it has a more natural feel in the hand to me
my thumb rest comfortably next to the screen will reading
overall , in my opinion this is a better ereader then the others out there .
no stars
be warned , potential b&n customer : if you have a problem with a defective , nook device , you are likely headed for customer service hell
be prepared to meet with an army of , apparently deceptive incompetents
any merits of b&n is nook products are offset by the company is customer service from hell
today , trying to resolve the problem of having just received a nook simple touch lemon , i have been lied to , hung up on , and received no help at all
the return call , promised by a supervisor at around six this evening , never came
so , around <NUM> hours later , i called back and spoke to another supervisor , identifying myself and asking for help
this call was disconnected on b&n is side , and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service
i have also been advised that i will have to wait quite a while for a replacement nook , though i live in manhattan and the site promises manhattan delivery
i'd read reviews on the b&n site and , i believe , on amazon as well , about b&n is horrific customer service
i can see now , from experience , that the horror stories are true
so if you buy a nook from b&n and get a lemon , as can happen with any , you are going to find yourself quite alone with your problem
whatever the merits of the kindle , i know from experience that amazon customer service lives up to its name
b&n customer service is essentially an insult to customers
i don not work for either company
i am just a customer with a defective nook simple touch , and i can not get any help from b&n
so if you look at the numbers and see that kindles far outsell nooks , b&n is misnamed customer service is likely at least part of the reason .
good reader
uploads books fast
i do not do wifi on this because i have heard bad things about the updates
also has problems if hooked up to a computer will take the shelves away
i have a lot of books so this is a big bad thing for me
but still is good .
received this as a gift last christmas ( 11 months ago )
manual claims that at a typical rate of reading , one should be able to use it for a month on one charge
my battery already lasts only <NUM> - <NUM> 1/2 hrs on one charge before the unit won not start due to a low battery level , requiring recharging
this is either a false claim on the part of b & n or else the batteries they use are of exceedingly poor quality
i have used hundreds of rechargeable batteries of various brands and technologies over the years ; if this thing suffers from a battery problem , then the batteries in these devices are on par with the cheapest quality / lemon nicad rechargeables i use to encounter <NUM> years ago
keep away .
personally , i am a kindle fan
but i got the nook to try out the ebook loan facilities from libraries
the layout and user interface is not as user friendly as the kindle , as on the kindle , pressing the home button brings us back to the library
on the nook , the home button opens a menu , then you need to select the options
also , if you sort the books by &<HASHTAG> ; recent&<HASHTAG> ; it does not show the most recently read books in order , but still displays books in order of &<HASHTAG> ; recently downloaded&<HASHTAG> ; , not a useful function
but on a positive note , the nook combines the touch facilities and button control ( to turn the pages ) of both the kindle touch & normal kindle
the borrowing of ebook a from public libraries is done on your pc , then imported onto the nook via adobe digital editions
a bit of a hassle , but a good option which kindles do not offer
overall , it is a good companion to kindle , especially if you wish to borrow library books .
i need to buy a gift for my mother is birthday and i know she likes to read books while on break at her job
i thought the nook would be a great gift for her , after reading reviews here on amazon that it can download and read free ebooks from library sites
our local library offers ebooks so i thought it would be great
after getting the nook , i learned a number of things : 1
the nook does not have a browser
it can only connect to the barnes and noble online bookstore
you are required to have a valid credit card , even to download free content
while there is a way to root ( hack ) the nook and thus enable a functional browser , it voids the warranty and is way too complicated to follow
i shouldn not have to hack a device to enable such a basic functionality
my mother isn not very computer savvy , and doesn not own a credit card , so i couldn not give her something like this
if it let you connect to library sites and download library books for free , it would be an ideal ereader
in it is current form , it is an money sinkhole
now i am out $70 and i still need to buy my mother a birthday present
i don not know why some of these other reviewers claim it can be used to download library ebooks
claiming that a device has a functionality that it in fact does not have , is a really despicable thing to do
if you don not mind a wireless device owning a copy of your credit card , and throwing money at it to read books , then the barnes & noble nook is right for you
if you are looking for an easy to use ereader for library ebooks , stay away !
i loved my nook very much , its very comfortable to use
what i love about nook more than kindle , that i could pick any russian book , magazine on internet download on my computer , convert to pd format and download on nook + i could pick on nook any size of letters for comfortable reading
on kindle you can make bigger size of letters only if you bought ebook on kindle store
other pd format books have so small size of letters , only if you zoom text , which i find uncomfortable like i said with nook no problem
also touch screen work great too .
my screen stopped working a week out of warranty
apparently , this is a common issue with the nook simple touch
customer service told me that barnes & noble is aware of this issue but they do not plan to repair or replace anything
this is not the way to treat customers
i am canceling all my and going to a different ereader .
i have owned the nook simple touch for about a year now and for the most part i am happy with it
the rate it which the words draw on the screen is a little slow sometimes and about once a month it freezes up
the only thing that unfreezes it is pushing the reset button for about <NUM> seconds
*update* about a month after the warranty expired , the screen froze up permanently
i haven not been able to figure out anything that will make the touch screen work again and when i called tech support , the only advice they could give me was to do a hard reset which isn not working to unfreeze the screen anymore
when it worked , i really liked it
i just wish that it still worked .
aside from various problems with this since the beginning , now i have to charge this nook every time i want to read
it is said to hold a charge for <NUM> weeks with the wifi off , but even if i only read for <NUM> minutes , the next day i have to charge it again because the battery is too low
i have tried <NUM> different chargers to no avail
instructions say to leave the nook on when not in use , so i do
it is absolutely maddening when i return home from a stressful day of work and just want to sit on my porch to read for a while to unwind and get some cool air - but no , i have to charge the fricking nook again and can not use it outside until it is been charged for a long time - and then have to deal with this frustration the next time i want to read
this nook is crap and the service by barnes & noble and the seller were both zero - no service whatsoever , with each party passing the responsibility onto the other
also , why is it that although the nook screen or buttons often have to be pressed very hard to turn a page , when the nook is closed to carry to my car or somewhere the slightest pressure changes the page or screen so i have to remember or write down what page i left off at ? this nook takes all the joy out of reading .
bought this to replace a sony have had for a couple years and am pleasantly surprised
arrived on time and works beautifully
only reason i did not give it a <NUM> star rating is that , for a basic ereader with wifi , it should have had a basic browser instead of only connecting to the nook store .
i will be writing this review in stages , as i hit stopping points
lightweight , nice screen , cute , buttons around the rim
touch screen is about as responsive as my iphone 4s
includes cable that has a standard usb a jack that plugs into just about everything : the computer , my hub , and the standard variety of wall worts and car chargers
this device is hard directed for "easy setup"
too hard
there should be a way to accept the tou and get to using the device
forcing wifi setup and registration is just bad planning
wifi - this is the stupidest thing about this device
once you charge it up , you turn it on , it asks for you to agree to terms , then it goes through wifi setup
note , you must have wifi , and connect to it successfully for the setup process to continue
at this time , i am stuck
i am in a town with limited wifi options , so it is not like i can just select a local hotspot
until i register the device , i have a brick
i have an old netgear router 802
11g&b ; with wep and wpa protection
the nook is capable of wpa2 security , but managed the wep and wpa security pretty nicely
strange thing was that i could get past the password , but it still would not connect to the internet ( i checked the setup with my iphone and everything worked fine )
customer service had very few answers and only about <NUM> steps for me to take to fix the problem
i tiered up to the supervisor and managed to pry out of her that the nook runs on an 802
1x eap network
upon googling it , this looks like the same network that causes a lot of android problems
next step is to hunt down a public wifi and try again
however : as soon as the thing charged and turned on , it showed up on my desktop and i was able to upload screensavers , books , documents , etc
the device has a very small available memory , ( about 250mb ) , so text only books can be loaded , but not large pdfs ( i bought this to enjoy the modernist cuisine series , 300mb+ pdfs )
i had an old version of calibre that worked right away
i will change this review and maybe the two stars rating once i have something more than an expensive sd card reader to play with
update ( after a stop at denny is ) okay , sure enough , once in a local restaurant with free wifi , i was able to connect , register and start using my nook
i made sure i had a couple books on it when i left , so i was able to read a chapter before i paid the check
in good light , this screen is beautiful
the characters are crisp and clear , it is easy to read , and you can make several screen adjustments including a limited list of fonts , size and margins
in lower light , the dark grey on light grey screen gets tougher to read than , say , a printed sheet of paper
still , in my apt with only a <NUM> watt light illuminating the room , it is still pretty easy to read
you get two choices on how the side buttons function
personally , i like the lower one turning the page forward ; because i tend to hold it in the lower corner , cupped in my hand
however , you can swipe the screen to turn pages , too
the os on the nook is a little simpler than , say the kindle fire
and maybe that is why i like it better
on this device , books are books are books
they can be epubs , pdfs , purchased or uploaded , they all go the same place , and they all end up in the same list
nothing grinds my gears more than having to look places for things based on where you bought them , or some other phantom difference established by the designers ( or worse , the marketing department - i am looking at you kindle )
the down side to this that if you have a large ebook library , you are pretty much stuck using the search function
there doesn not seem to be a way to organize books any other way
[checking online
] oh crap , they have this whole "shelf" system built in
damn , scratch that organizational thing , i will get back to ya there
screen savers
forget about those fancy things on your pc , the nook is idea of a screen saver is to place a picture on the screen when it sleeps
the default is a bunch of pictures of famous authors
nice , you can also choose nature scenes
but , remember i said that you could upload directly to the nook ? well , here ya go
create a folder with the name of your screen saver set , upload some 800x600 pics ( jpg/png formats ) in portrait mode and voila ! you have your own custom set
i went to nook
com and downloaded a bunch of str trek geeky stuff at first , but then realized i could just take a few snapshots and convert them to <NUM> greys myself
now i have a folder of a dozen of my pictures as the screen saver
very nice
kinda like having an image viewer as well
getting calibre to work with the device once it was working was a complete breeze
i bought a 16gb micro sd on sale and added it
the card mounts on the desktop separately , but calibre is all tuned up to read them correctly
so , when you put stuff on the device , you have the option of loading it in main memory or on the card
come to think of it , a series of small cards could be another way to organize as well
put your sf collection on this card , classics on that one , etc
oh , also , once i got the registration completed at denny is i went into settings and disconnected the wifi
it is been operating in that mode ever since
so , only that first time is needed
adding two more stars for all the juicy goodness
i will play around with it a while and see if we can get it to 5
no real serious problems yet
updatepdfs - okay , so pretty much everything else that displays pdfs tries to incorporate the formatting of the document
this strange little device actually reads the text ( easiest way to save formatting = text + format ) , and produces it in standard format
it is a little disorienting but it makes for a much more consistent reading experience
micro sdi think my real problem with this device was getting a huge sd card for this then thinking i had to fill it with a whole library
bah ! granted , those <NUM> really large pdfs need some room , but i could have fit them all on a <NUM> gb card and still had plenty of room to spare
*sigh* all that room meant i could have 100s of books on the device
think : tim taylor " more power ! " {grunt grunt}shelves
the device keeps track of the shelves internally , so it is not like a document you could edit outside the device and use your computer is search function to organize
you must go through your entire library , no search functions , one book at a time to add to shelves
great if you know what you are looking for , but not all sets start with lord of the rings 1 :
if you buy this , don not get an external card right away
the onboard memory can hold a lot of stuff
shorter onboard lists mean you have less stress with shelves and such
i won not be exploring the b&n ; store for a while ( a long while )
i have a massive library to work through first
so look elsewhere for those reviews
i have heard the store is mighty nice though
no ads , easy to use , a joy to read
this , my final entry sees that last star moving up the device
take heed of the speedbumps i have experienced and enjoy this cute little reader
now , i just need a case
: ) another update : months later and i have read a small library on this thing
it is a delight
but i still find myself avoiding pdfs a lot because of the disorientation
also : to the <NUM> people who did not find this review helpful - bite me
leave a comment .
i bought this directly from barns and noble
i get books from the library on my computer and that works good
the battery life is very good and the screen is very responsive
this is better then the kindle because it has expandable memory and accepts all popular formats for ebooks
the one complaint i have is that when you read pdfs you do not get the dictionary features and some of the writing is weirdly spaced
that is not what i bought it for so it does not matter to me
it has survived many months in public high school so it is very durable
i have of course bought it a protective case though
barns and noble ebooks are cheaper then regular books by a couple of dollars .
more updates at the bottom of my review ! my review includes details of kindle 3 , the newest version ! with the time period , i could still return my nook , but i am still completely in love with it and don not want the kindle for the reasons below
i was one of those people who was averse to the idea of an for a long time
i liked the feel of a real book , i was in love with free books at the library , why would i start paying for them ? then , my library got "overdrive" , which is free from the library
then one day soon after , i woke up and the urge for an was there
the nook was my final choice
it took a lot of back and forth and research to get to this point
i bought and tried the sony touch reader , returned it , and went and got the nook
i really honestly wanted the kindle most , because i am a loyalist
i love amazon and felt really comfortable here if i decided to actually start purchasing books again
but below , i will give you comparisons to the three big readers and the reasons i got the nook : - nook ( n ) by barnes & noble- kindle 3 ( k ) by amazon
com- sony reader touch ( st ) 1
my biggest decision maker was epub
this is the format in which you can take ebooks out of the library , so i needed whatever i got to be epub friendly
n : the nook is epub friendly
as well as pdf , and many other formats
k : the kindle won not use epub , which was all i needed to know
it mainly uses it is own amazon format , while it also uses pdf , mobi and a few others
it makes me feel like amazon is being greedy , wanting us to only use and buy books from the amazon site
don not they understand that i love my library ? st : sony reader is epub friendly
pretty much the same as the nook
price ! n : <NUM> with wifist : <NUM> no wifik : <NUM> with wifi ( or <NUM> with wifi and free 3g ) while kindle <NUM> is <NUM> dollars cheaper , it doesn not give me those free library books , so it really doesn not make any difference to me
*you can now lend some books from the nook for <NUM> days to a friend with their new "lend me" technology
while this is in beta stages , and not all books are lendable
it depends on the agreement with the publisher
the other two you cannot lend at all
*the nook has a replaceable , rechargable battery
so it will last awhile , but when its dwindling , you can spend <NUM> bucks and put a new one in yourself
for the kindles , they are sealed inside
people have said you can do it yourself , but you must be tech savvy
or you can send it away to amazon for about the cost of [
]+shipping charges and they will replace it for you
*you can expand your memory on the nook and on the sony touch
the kindle you cannot , though the kindle will hold 3 , 500 books , don not know if you need more space then that ? ! *nook has a fancy color touch screen at the bottom
while the sony touch has a touch screen ( the entire screen ) , it was slow to respond , very klunky and not very pretty
the kindle is loaded with buttons along the outside of the screen
* all three have a built in dictionary , which i think is just awesome
*the new kindle now meets with the nook on their slim width
people used to say the nook was more comfortable to hold because of the width , now the kindle will be as well
*yet , the nook is heavier by about <NUM> oz then the kindle or sony
*the nook battery life lasts about <NUM> days with wifi off , the sony has <NUM> days , and the new kindle is up to a month with wifi off ( 3 weeks with it on ) this wasn not a big deal to me , and i was more interested in the other features the nook did have , like replaceable battery and expandable memory
*and you may be wondering , why did i purchase a sony touch , and then scamper back hours later to return it ? well
when i got it out of the box , it wasn not techy enough for me
it felt like a very basic , bare bones
and i already had in my head all the things you hear about the nook : books more expensive , and for some reason i thought it wasn not epub friendly
but the moment i had that sony in my hand , i went to look at the nook more indepth online
the sony online library was nothing in comparison to kindle is amazon
com or nook is barnes & noble
one of my favorite reads recently was the hunger games by suzanne collins
it was nowhere to be found on sony
that gave me a bad taste in my mouth
*in the past people have complained that barnes & noble is significantly more expensive then amazon
i did some price comparisons of big titles , and found them most of the time to be exactly the same
i think barnes & noble might be trying to keep in line with amazon to draw more readers ( like me ! ) into getting the nook
on the whole , the nook is everything i wanted
i have downloaded some free classics from google books , i have taken out library ebooks and it was really easy ! i even bought my first book ( well , ebook ) in a long time
despite being a new release , it was under ten bucks
i also bought another book i have been meaning to read for years for under four dollars
the nook is comfortable to hold with one hand
i like the using the touch screen to "swipe" and turn pages
and tops on my list , i didn not feel horrificly guilty for buying it
one fifty is a reasonable price for such a fun new book reader
update oct '10 : a software update is coming in nov : "dramatically increase page turn speed , customized b&n ; library organization and password protection
it also includes the ability to sync across all nook and all devices enabled with our free nook apps , by syncing your last page read
if you forget your nook at home , use the nook app for ipad , iphone , ipod touch , android smartphone or pc to pick up where you left off
and , the next time you pick up your nook , the reading now page will be updated and ready to go
update dec '10 : the update was a pinch to install , and it has some stellar perks that make the nook even more loveable
the shelving option it a lot of fun for those people who like to organize
you can name a shelf anything you want
the only limit is your barnes and noble book will stay in their barnes folder , while any other books you have will stay in my documents
the page turn is very fast
i do read across multiple devices , but for most people that will be a great new feature .
i absolutely love it
while it doesn not have the bells and whistles of the other ebook readers , it does exactly what it is meant to do
it allows you to read books
i bought this as gateway into ebook technology and i love it
the unit fits into your hands nicely and is not heavy
the buttons on the side are helpful in turning the pages
it charges fast and the battery lasts a decent amount of time .
i waited until june <NUM> until i bought a nook
so far i am loving it
i love the page turning swipe feature
those that gave the nook <NUM> star are the ones who got theirs with the 1
1 firmware
the firmware is now up to 1
4 and the price has dropped to $199 .
update 6/3/10 : b&n ; is offering a $50 gift card with every purchase from june <NUM> =>
they will honor purchases up to two weeks prior to the launch of the promotion
i bought mine 5/22 and my gift card arrives in <NUM> business days ! now that is what i call a company with excellent customer service
another and very important reason why nook beats kindle
nook review : i did my research on and thought long and hard about the two main contenders - nook and kindle
i chose the nook
why ?
1 ) it is design is ( as far as anything is ) because the hardware is designed such that software and firmware updates can make it more functional in the future
kindle requires new hardware
i just read a new one will be out in august '10 , and no , no touch screen ! 2 ) amazon ( kindle ) is not a dedicated book store whose sole livelihood is books , like b&n ; ( nook )
amazon has demonstrated this with its wrangling with publishers to the dismay of both the publishers and amazon is customers3 ) yes , the nook was rushed out last year but they are now already on v1
3 software , but it works well and has added features and corrected some early flaws
the page turns are now quicker and very acceptable , especially compared with a real book page turn
whoever you are with , they will have some problems and features you do or don not like
there are supposedly more books via b&n ; , but never the books you actually want to read - kindle has some missing for me as well as b&n
; b&n ; will no doubt keep updating its software regularly and amazon make you pay for new kindles ( and risk you not being able to read your on the next version , like v1 to v2 ) pricing is a little crazy right now as publishers seem to be trying to establish the "value" of versus paperback/hardcover
some are more expensive and some are changing prices weekly
it is the same situation with both kindle and nook from what i can tell
4 ) the touch screen is a nice feature ( hardware ) , but big fingers can hit the wrong selection occasionally
it is comparable with the itouch touchscreen performance imho
navigation is maybe more hassle than the kindle as a result
this also makes the nook smaller ( no physical keyboard to worry about ) and easier to hold , even though it is marginally heavier than the kindle
5 ) the nook can be personalized with your own photos for wallpaper and ( wrong wording as it is just a picture for when the nook is in sleep mode - no with screens )
you can add more storage in a nook with a micro sd card6 ) the kindle battery lasts longer , but the nook is fine with the turned off - about <NUM> hours
the nook battery is and costs just $29 , unlike the kindle7 ) the nook extended warranty covers any accidental breakage/spillage for the full <NUM> years
8 ) a b&n ; store is always nearby to get help in person and they currently offer a free book per week when you visit the store ( in week <NUM> of <NUM> right now ) 9 ) using independent free software available on the web ( calibre ) , i can convert and "sideload" documents and news feeds to my nook
i have sideloaded web pages ( originally saved as html ) , word documents and
pdf is , all in
epub format
this is no doubt possible with kindle too , but the nook is more than flexible for my needs
i read usa today and the bbc news feeds on my nook every day and they include b&w ; photos and diagrams which are clearly readable
calibre has many more available
10 ) using sigil , again free software , i can modify to add chapters or correct errors and sideload them to my nook
again , no doubt a possibility with kindle , but i am not sure
11 ) nook is just the one size , no kindle dx equivalent
for my needs though , the small nook is "back pocket" sized ( literally fitting in my back pocket ) and is small enough to read but carry around
i need reading glasses without exception to read and so can read at the smallest text size with no problem
12 ) i am not bothered about having a music player and the speakers are not really capable as listening devices ( tinny and low volume ) , but it is there and will no doubt allow for in a future software release , which will be useful
the sound quality through headphones is good
i have had my nook a week and have read two books and many daily news articles
it is comfortable to use , it is fun to use and while maybe a luxury we could all do without , i have read a couple free that otherwise , i would never have done - and i have many more downloaded and ready in the wings
it is actually now a hassle to read through a real paperback or hardcover
: - ) the choice is yours , but my choice was the nook and i think it was a good choice
update 6/2/10 -
pdf is on the nooki have found that
pdf books , especially with charts and diagrams ( ie technical/text books ) are problematic to read on the nook
interestingly the b&n ; store personnel stated that they had never tried to read a
pdf on the nook - maybe just a way to avoid the issue ? however , the kindle will no doubt have the same issue , unless you use the dx which is larger and so you can read
pdf is natively
if you read a native
pdf on the nook it is the whole page squeezed down to the 5" screen - impossible to read
if you use calibre to convert the
pdf to
epub format , then the end result is variable
diagrams get screwed up or disappear and while text can be enlarged with the font size function , even the text formatting may or may not be acceptable
either way , i have given up trying to read such books on my nook
: - ( i would not recommend the nook to anyone trying to use it for school where
pdf is are the only format available
the problem is not nook/kindle , but the way
pdf is are created
they don not have the necessary information encoded to be able to convert them to other formats and retain their
pdf look
if you are going to save any documents for conversion to
epub format , don not use
i have found saving as
html renders a perfectly acceptable
epub file when converted , including diagrams and charts when archiving web pages , for example
see also my review of the javoedge snake skin case for barnes & nobles nook ( flip style )
my wife adores this product ! it was our household is first
there is a little learning curve at first and expect to need a household pc to talk to it via a usb micro ( not mini ) data cable with data capability ( some usb cables are just ) and if you get a used deal on one without a usb micro data+power ability , you are looking at up to $20
00 ( unless you get one cheaper taking a risk on a crappier cable )
---only thing is it is hard for someone whose disabled with touching or vision issues to use
though you can increase font size , the rare occasion you have to type something out it is kinda small but that doesn not happen often on the nook itself
----she uses hers mainly to check things out from the clark county library district in las vegas
once we registered with the library , we installed adobe digital editions which is the digital rights management
that took some doing but once in place , you tell the ade of the nook you have , authorize it , and then from that point on anytime you want to check out a library book you simply go to their site , check out the electronic version which comes into your computer where the ade recognizes it and outputs it to your nook
after x amount of days
when the checkout time expires , the file disables itself and you either get another book from the library or re / the same one for another x days
it makes the public library a whole new experience and that is great because , guess what
your tax dollars paid for it ! and the author gets their cut too
all around
we have never bought an from barnes and noble yet , and you do have to register the nook with them at first though you don not have to put in a credit card , but that step is probably skippable it is just handy because if you want help from b&n ; they will want you to at least register the product with them
not a big deal and it is during your initial procedures ( and that is the one time you need to use the aforementioned little hard to type on notypewriter' display
happy nooking ( p
as a bad pun , i told my wife that if the <NUM> stooges owned it , it would be a
but i was frowned at
guess it is funnier if curley is your favorite stooge
i digress : ) )
this is the most fantastic device imaginable
it has traveled to england , scotland , turkey , egypt and qatar and has even taken a cruise ! it has traveled around in a purse , a briefcase and a carryon
it has downloaded books in pdf as well as the format , from barnes & noble as well as other suppliers
it has borrowed and loaned books
it also gets automatic software updates and even accesses the web to check or the latest news
this is one device that will never disappoint
so easy to read
a big plus is that when you search for a subject on b&n ; , once it has exhausted the b&n ; offerings ( some free ! ) , it goes on to list all the google books in the same category
if you make selections of google books those are downloaded exactly the same as paid selections
i love the way this all happens automatically
you don not have to do anything at all
you can also add audio books , other audio files
the approximately 1 , 500 book capacity plus the capability of adding more storage is another real plus .
i bought a nook during one of my visits to tampa , more specifically at the wiregrass shops
i must admit that i was tremendously excited when i got the device , because of the reviews and also the sd card capability
my joy was short lived
during the <NUM> weeks that i owned the product i was never able once to open none of my sideloaded pdf is that i have amassed over the years ( over 30gb - i am a voracious reader )
a long string of calls to customer service and the shop itself ensued , after which i decided to take the trip again ( i live outside of the usa ) to return the device directly to the store
much to my surprise , they were extremely receptive at the store and also very apologetic for the device is inability to function properly outside the states and also the lack of functionality and propietary issues
i was refunded for all the items ( nook , cover case and screen protector ) in no time at all
so , in summary , the nook gets a zero star in my review for paying more attention to the esthetics rather than the functionality of the reader , but b&n ; gets a five star rating for their approachability and for their great costumer service !
so , i bought the nook a few weeks ago when the price cut went into action and was constantly going back and forth with the thoughts of buying this , or buying the kindle
i bought the device with 3g simply because it was only a little more , and i travel a lot and don not have house
i remember when i used to scoff at the nook when walking into b&n ; and can not believe i ever did that ! i love the feel of being able to go into the bookstore , with my nook and feel connected to the actual store
i will admit you have to do your research ( read forums , articles etc
) because the nook demo employees , are not going to know everything
also you must read the 'manual' and follow it to a not' don not take the reader out of the box and drain what little battery you have left because you are going to have battery issues ( needing it to drain completely a few times and then fully charging it before the battery is at full capacity ) a lot of people may think their nook is 'frozen' when actually the battery is drained , and when that happens the screen is set to whatever screen saver , book page etc you were on when it died
there is no '' it will just stop , and touchscreen will not be active , once you plug it up and charge it a little , it will be good again
also the constant use of the touchscreen will drain the unit faster ( obvious unfortunate fact ) there are a lot of books available at the moment ( depending what genre you read ) especially for teen and and fiction ( my books ) , and i was surprised to see all of the 'lend me features' for a good portion of the books i was interested in
also b&n ; really listens to complaints and proves that with upgrades ( faster page turning , less freezing etc
) also even when there was a manufacturing error , they were quick to send out a new improved nook
overall , i love this device , it is fun , its sleek with a solid feel , and it is for future updates
it may be for you , it may not
do your research , read forums and reviews , go into the respective stores and hold and try the device

after what i thought was a thorough research between the kindle , nook & sony ereaders , i took the plunge & bought the nook
what appealled to me most were the web browser & epub use to check out books from the library
however , after fully charging the nook , i took it with me for a weekend at the beach
i didn not bring the the charger because b&n ; said battery would last up to <NUM> days with wireless off
well , i found out the hard way , with wireless on , it barely a couple hours reading at night & in the afternoon by the beach
oy , was i frustrated with nothing left to read & another night & afternoon left
lesson learned : must bring charger everywhere ! lost <NUM> * for this
i am not a fan of touch screens , still love my trusty cellphone
so browsing the web was a pain for me , having to navigate around the screen with my finger
page turning was fine , but i think i have overdone it since my finger began stinging from constant friction : 0 ) )
scrolling down & up also frustrates me - most of the time i have to swipe several times to get it to move
not to mention hitting the back button after book downloads - the response time was slow which made me think it didn not sense my touch , so i'd do it again & it goes back all the way to the main menu
grrr ! what a pain as i have to restart the store search & find the page again
b&n ; samples are horrible ! they give you <NUM> pages
but it is the cover , copyright , dedication page with only a paragraph of the actual story
not enough to make me want to buy a book
the closest b&n ; is <NUM> hour drive away so i couldn not take advantage of the cafe freebies or free reading
after i discovered that i cannot organize books into folders , that was the final straw
i read novels with racy titles , my <NUM> y
son wanted to read his classics on the nook but i didn not want to lend it to him because he would see all my books & potentially read them
this is a biggie for me so lost another *
features i am happy with : i was able to books from my library & i was able to put my pdf books on the nook
yey ! unfortunately , my library just got into ebooks & have only a handfull of books so it will be a while until i can fully take advantage of this feature
well , these are my personal experiences with which i now realize that i didn not do a thorough reasearch as i first thought , lol
my fault
but i still like my nook , though i am no longer in love with it like when i first received it
i have also ordered the latest kindle so we will see which one i will keep - i am looking forward to the keys on that , lol .
paid $[
] for this in april 2010
biggest waste of money i ever spent
not worth the hassle of getting it repaired
made me miserable and unhappy for three days
this is not how i want to spend my life--feeling miserable and abused and wondering how i got suckered into this huge mistake
the good--or perhaps the ok--i found nothing really good
gsm service is free for purchasing books and most uses
not all that valuable
i'd be happy with just wifi and enough memory to carry around a personal library
with me
gsm available for anything else but books
wifi works ok , after some fussing with the settings
many times i got error messages
i kept trying until it worked
there is some issue with the wifi but it can be fussed with until it works--starting and stopping it
the bad--just about everything : i travel a lot , and need to carry my library with me
this device does not work to download books outside of the us
why not ? i can understand the gsm not working , but if i have wifi access somewhere , i should be able to load anything i want anywhere
i can load books anywhere with my ipod touch
requires a us address
why ? why can not anyone use it ? device requires that you sign up with b&n ; with a credit card
why can not i download free books without a b&n ; account ? you cannot use this device until it is registered
this device is barely functional
the interface is poorly designed , b&n ; does a great job of making it difficult to find free books , and the books that are normally free--b&n ; charges you $1 to $2 for these books ! outrageous ! most people would not have a clue they are being ripped off being charged for books in the public domain
the interface is so bad that everyone is hacking these devices to make them functional
do a google search for nook soft root--better yet check out youtube and search for trook
do a search on nook itself for free and you won not find free books , you will find books with "free" in the title or crippled editions with two chapters free
there is no menu selection for find free books
if you do find a free book it will be after wading through page after page of the same title--it would take days to find even a few interesting free books
with the kindle , at least you get to choose a few best sellers are part of your purchase price
the b&n ; give you nothing for free but garbage
they want to frustrated enough to pay them more money for overpriced books
personally i can not see paying the same price for an electronic book as i do a paper bound book that i can resell or give as a gift
electronic books cost nothing to produce and distribute--why do they cost so much ? it is gouging , imho
to get a free book into your nook is a nightmare pita
i use an ipod touch and was able to load <NUM> free books into it , in about <NUM> minutes--easy and simple
not menu after menu and then find out the book was not loaded after all
with b&n ; nook it takes a long time to select and load a book
you have to pay for a book , even if it is zero dollars--another menu choice , just to get you in the habit of hitting a purchase button
there are lots of free books out there
why should it be hard to load these ? personally , i want a large library with me because i travel alot , and i want to find what i want quickly , and i want to read it without hassle
pfd files can be loaded but these are not , so that type is pretty small and hard to read
i can not read them , and i have reasonably good near vision
if you are young with perfect vision you might be able to read for a while until your eyes get tired
pdf don not work well on this device
changing a page is a pain with the controls
there is a way to use a finger swipe that some people have difficulty with
i personally hate wading through pages on the life of the author , at the beginning of the book when all i want to do is read the book itself
books with a ton of crap in the front , with articles about the life of the author , acknowledgments , are a pita toget around
scrolling down to chapter one to start the book is problematic--sometimes you are sent back to the index , other times you go to chapter one
why should i have to scroll and enter a command twice
why can not it work the first time ? i constantly had the urge to use the white part of the device as a touch screen , but only the bottom is a touch screen
i found myself thinking , my ipod touch is better than this
it is fast to touch what i want
give me something better like a blackberry pointer ball ! display is flashing every time a page is changed
i found this constantly annoying
why ? there is no reason for the flashing
every page flashes at you ! you will learn to hate it ! usb power connector
this is a weak spot of the device
instead of using a robust connector , they use a micro usb connector
it is wobbly
even a would have been better
at times i could not make this connector work
it is delicate
it doesn not want to mate up
i found i needed to be very precise on aligning it , even then it would not connect
i doubt that this will survive <NUM>
if you buy this device , do not expect it to last more than two years
it would be smart to get the extended warrantee--another $60 for two years--if you buy a nook
charge it only when you have too , or you will wear out this connector in a short period of time
while the battery life is good , given the crappy connector , i don not understand why they didn not put a battery times larger in this device so that the connector would last longer and have less wear
memory storage is limited to about 1gb with space to add another memory card
to bring it up to <NUM> or <NUM> gb , it will cost you another $30 to $60 , or if you buy it from b&n ; it will be twice as much
i feel the device is worthless without at least another 8gb of storage
i'd rather it came with another 16gb
the ipad comes with that much or more--so you get a color full touch screen for not much more than the cost of the memory you need
this is a good gift for someone clueless about electronics that won not know any better about how badly b&n ; crippled their android operating system and don not understand what a good interface is all about
do yourself a favor
try an ipod touch , and i assume the ipad works as well
apple makes quality products that work right , with strong connectors , great software , and are backed up with the highest rated customer support
b&n ; built something with one purpose only , to sell electronic books--and to make it difficult to find free books , and to break quickly
if you want to be screwwed over , buy one of these and then bend over because b&n ; sees you as someone to be used and abused--not a valuable customer
if b&n ; made it easy to download free books , i'd be more forgiving on the crappy software they use and the delicate power connector
if b&n ; made a decent , usable interface , and made it easy to load whole library is of free books , i'd probably buy some electronic books and they would earn my business
as it is , i will never buy an or any other book from b&n
; that is how angry i am about wasting money on this product
my nook is dead after only three days
i wish i could return it
i don not have the original packaging either , so that even if i got a new replacement , i cannot sell it on ebay to get my money back
i am not sure what i will do
i will be calling b&n ; tomorrow to see about a replacement , and begging for a store credit instead so i can buy an ipad instead
the bottom line is , i am more than disappointed about the product
i am angry enough that i will never do business with b&n ; again--even if they refund me the price of this device
i don not even want it back if it were repaired
i'd rather pay $600 for an ipad , purchasing from a company that charges a lot for products that are well thought out and work well
while i may wish the price was less for apple products , at least i don not have this awful feeling of being screwwed ten different ways by b&n ; with their service and nook product
for those who think this is a good product
you are fools who don not know enough to make a valid judgment
i laugh at you , because your nook will be dead within a year .
after reading many technical and customer reviews of both the nook and the kindle , i purchased the nook
i think that both the nook and kindle are good products , but the nook offers the user some unique advantages over its counterpart--the kindle
first , a buyer can actually test drive the nook before purchasing it at either best buy or at a barnes and noble store
the kindle is only available on line at amazon
i cannot invest my hard earned money into buying an electronic device without trying it out first
the physical design of the nook is attractive , sturdy , and compact
navigating is easy
the user does not have to use the left/right arrows on the nook to turn the page of an ebook
the pages of a book can be easily turned by simply swiping the touch screen
bookmarks can also be set
this is an important feature for me since i tend to read more than one book at a time
secondly , the nook offers web browsing
i was able to link my nook to my home wireless network and surf web pages
although the software is still in its beta stages , i am impressed at what i can already do
next , i can download and/or design wallpapers and screensavers for the nook
this might be a minor point , but it makes the nook unique and customizable for its owner
the nook is storage capacity can be expanded
the nook comes with 2gb of storage that the user can expand up to 16gb by purchasing and installing a micro sd card
the nook is internal battery lasts about five years with normal use ( this is according to technical reviewers ) , and a replacement battery can be purchased and installed by the user
nook users also have a community forum they can join on the barnes and noble website to share ideas , tips , and news about the nook
also , improvements in the nook software updates are due to customer input
i like for my suggestions to be heard and the nook engineering team is listening
don not take my word for it
test drive the nook for yourself before you make a decision .
i will admit up front that when i chose the nook over kindle and sony is , i was impressed by that nifty full color touchscreen at the bottom of reading screen
glitz does not equal function , as i promptly found out
to be fair to nook , if all you want to do is read , the device works , and works pleasantly
i received my nook in february , so it had the latest firmware updates , and i experienced none of the delays in downloading , missed sections of books , delays in page turning that early reports noted
but if i was attempting to do anything more than clicking the page turning buttons , ouch ! the nifty little full color touchscreen ( not to be confused with the reading screen , which is permanently ) just can not do it is job
it responds slowly and inconsistently to touch , is quirky in its response , and virtually ( no pun intended ) unusable
the virtual keyboard : what a nightmare
it is a true challenge to type more than one or two words without making an error , and trying to fix that error degenerates into a in short order
the unit itself is pleasant to the hand , and comfortable
it is also darn slick in its appearance , and if aesthetics are your only criteria , well , go for it
but here is why i returned the nook after one week : any optional feature , such as bookmarking , highlighting text and annotating it , search functions for previous book marks and annotations : purely a nightmare
the processor of the nook appears to be vastly underpowered , and each instruction you give the touchscreen results in a wait that seems interminable
it took me <NUM> seconds , after i got good at it , to highlight <NUM> lines at the bottom of a page
simply not acceptable
battery life : might have just been my own unit , but in <NUM> hours : dead
i also experienced two full scale lockups , with all buttons simply refusing to work for several minutes
the nook is only advantage , as far as i can tell , is access to significantly more free content than you can currently access on kindle
not worth the incredible frustration of wrestling with a device that went for touchscreen technology , but forgot that the touchscreen needs to be functional before you bring it to market
update as of 2/11/2010 : i purchased a kindle after returning my nook , and have been using it for three days
what an incredible difference in terms of ease of use
the keyboard is very functional , bookmarking and note taking is effortless , the dictionary function ( move the cursor to a word , instantly a definition pops up ) is wonderful
battery consumption is imperceptible , after <NUM> day , no visible drain ( my nook lasted <NUM> hours )
downside of the kindle ? books whose copyright had expired ( e
wuthering heights ) that were free on nook , are <NUM> cents on kindle
nook lists all vendors of a given book , with prices conveniently visible , kindle does not
lastly , nook had a tiny clock in a corner of the screen , which i found very useful
not available on kindle
overall : for my needs , no contest whatsoever : kindle
i did a lot of research on the different ebook readers before purchasing my nook
i went back and forth between amazon is kindle and b&n is nook
the thing that sold me on the nook was the ability to download books from other sources than just amazon
i can download books from my local library , google books , along with barnes & noble is selection of over <NUM> million books they offer
the ability to download any epub and pdf files is a plus
i like the touch pad vs
keyboard on kindle
it took a little getting used to as it is very touch sensitive , but once i got the hang of it , it is a smooth way to navigate
one of the criticisms of nook has been some sluggishness with the nook , which i have maybe a tiny bit of , but we are talking maybe a second or so , so it is no big deal really
there have been many criticisms about the battery life of the nook , but to me it is a minor thing as all i have to do is plug it in about every <NUM> or <NUM> days if i use my nook excessively
it lasts longer if the wifi is turned off
i can go a week without having to recharge it then
i also like the ability to replace the battery myself rather than having to send the the entire kindle in to have it replaced
one of the nicest features of the nook is being able to go into my local b&n bookstore and talking to a real live person if i have any questions or have any problem with my nook
b&n has nook stations right in their stores with people who are there to answer questions or help with problems you may encounter
they are very helpful
the kindle does not offer that kind of service
all in all i am very happy with my nook and would recommend one to anyone looking for an ebook reader .
despite all of the negative reviews , i decided to take a chance and buy the nook , once i tested it out at my local b&n
; i loved the look and feel of this device and was looking forward to the convenience of buying more books without adding more clutter to my already cluttered bookcases
i read all of the pros and cons of owning a kindle and compared it to the pros and cons of owning a nook
the nook won because of its versatility ( epub format , book lending , etc )
my nook arrived on january 28th
since then , i have experienced one crash and had to figure out how to use the touchscreen so that i can flip the pages without having to use the arrow keys
the latter took some practice , but i eventually mastered it and have been enjoying this feature ever since
i have also read three books in the space of a week , which is a personal record for me , as it normally takes two weeks for me to read a single paperback , longer if i am reading an ebook on an lcd screen
the eink technology is fabulous
i can read all day ( and do ) without eyestrain
the letters are very crisp on a plain white background
even better , you can adjust the font size from small to extra large
not only that but the nook comes with several fonts : amasis , helvetica neue and light classic
i am happy with the amasis as it resembles times roman
my only complaint so far is that i am not able to categorize my books into categories
at the moment , i am forced to wade through my list until i find the book that i want to read
b&n ; has already sent out an update , which is a good improvement over the old interface
while the touch interface can be a bit buggy ( sometimes you have to flick your finger more than once or use the arrow keys to turn the page
) , i can turn pages in one second compared to the seconds it would take with the original software
that wasn not a big deal until i received the upgrade
i also like what they have done with the bookmarks feature
before , they had a strange numerical format for bookmarks
with this upgrade , it lists the page that you bookmarked , which is much nicer
i love how i can download samples of ebooks directly from my nook without having to rely on the b&n ; site to do everything
once you finish the sample , you have the option to buy
if you decide to buy the book , you will be taken to the last page you read so that you can continue from there
you can also archive the books that you have read directly from your nook with the press of a button , which helps manage your list
sideloading my pdf ebooks onto my nook was an easy experience
however , you can not categorize your documents ; you can only sort them by title or author
another great aspect of owning a nook is that you can check out ebooks from your local libraries ( see [
] for a list of libraries near you ) , sideload books that you have bought from fictionwise and other ebook stores , and download free ebooks from either the b&n ; site or google books
that is what ultimately sold me on the nook , the versatility and freedom to choose where i want to buy or download free ebooks
the nook is not proprietary , unlike the kindle and the ipad
the interface is very easy to use
it comes with a manual that you can read on the device , or on the b&n ; website
if you are still stuck on an issue , i found this great forum ( [
] ) with friendly people who can help you
i have yet to check out the lend feature because my family and friends have yet to embrace this technology
other than my issue with organization , i am really enjoying my nook
i am looking forward to reading many books in the future , thanks to this wonderful device
highly recommended
side note : i agree with s
dayton about the ipad
after reading a few ebooks on my itouch and my mac , i have to agree with him about the eyestrain
for casual surfing and watching video , lcd works fine
but for longterm reading , eink is the way to go .
i have researched the readers for about two years
i only buy electronics after i can give the item a test drive
upon that note , i have always been a huge fan of amazon
for the first time i could not go to a store and compare prices and see the item in question
the nook was available to be put through anything i wanted to try
first of all the new nook in stores has the most recent upgrades
no problem with turning the page at all , touch screen worked great
in the store i downdoaded a book in under <NUM> minute and have downloaded <NUM> books at home that are nearly <NUM> pages long in under <NUM> minute
the nook can connect to your computer ( as does the sony )
you can also download from other sources other than the dealer
the nook also downloads without any effort ( as does the kindle )
the nook is battery you can change at home
it also accepts a memory card , which allows you to expand your book collection
the nook also has other advantages , but i was only wanted a reliable reader
barnes and noble has a home run with the nook because it combined the features of the sony and the kindle in one very neat package .
after months of research for my first ereader i finally decided on the nook
with all the buzz , i , of course , ran out to bn to see the nook when it first came out and was incredibly disappointed at that time as it was painfully sluggish and i had almost crossed it off my list for purchase
however , i went back and saw it again at the store after about <NUM> weeks from my first viewing and what a difference ! barnes and noble has made great strides
a friend showed me her kindle and i got to play with it and i looked in stores and saw the sony reader as well
did much research online as well on some of the others such as jetbook lite
as much as i love amazon and shop here more often than i probably should lol
i decided on the nook seeing the improvements that were already made in that short amount of time
what sealed the deal for me was the sd card option to expand memory and you can change the battery yourself as opposed to having to send your device back over a simple battery change
i am not regretting my decision to go with the nook at all
i have to admit that it did freeze up on me twice , but it only did that when i interrupted the charging process
so , i don not know exactly what caused that
no problems at all while reading
as far as reading on the nook , its a great device
downloading books is fast and simple to do
page turning is fast now
its a dream come true for an avid reader like me
the only con that i have noticed so far is battery life
i think its a huge stretch to say the battery lasts <NUM> days
however , the turns itself off after being idle for a minute or so , so you don not have to manually turn it off
when you activate the menu , it will reconnect to the network
so , bn is making an effort to increase battery life without much manual interaction
i highly recommend the nook
with bn updates coming as quick as they are , i think this device is proving to be the superior ereader .
i purchased a kindle for my wife last christmas
she loves it and uses it more than any other gift i ever purchased her
she was having so much fun with it i decided to get an ereader for myself but i was drawn more toward the nook
i read so many bad reviews about the nook i wasn not sure if i should get it or a kindle or maybe something different with a touch screen and wireless connection
i thought about it for a few weeks and noticed that the reviews started getting better
i decided to go for it
i ordered it last wednesday from b&n ; and received it <NUM> days later
i am so happy i did
i didn not experience any of the the negatives i read about with exception that battery could stay charged longer
talking about the battery , it is nice to know that you can change it yourself and at a much lessor expense than with a kindle
i will probably never need it but it is also nice to be able to add a memory card to hold more content
and the nook just looks nicer in my opinion
the new update was released the same day i received my nook and i updated the firmware the second day i had it and it runs even more smoother
i have been a gadget man all my life but this is my first touch screen device
i had no problems navigating the menus and the menus changed fast enough for me
my wife still loves her kindle but i think she is a little jealous
she asked me why i didn not get her a nook for christmas
i was completely in the dark about ereaders until just <NUM> months ago
i know during my research i found people that were experiencing problems and were unhappy with every reader i checked into
if you were putting off getting a nook because of bad reviews , i would give them another look
there has been <NUM> firmware updates already that probably addressed many of the earlier concerns
that is not bad for a device that was only released a short while ago
i am sure there will be further updates as time goes on and it will get only better
i am still waiting for the perfect ebook reader
i bought the nook for these reasons : 1 ) it reads ebooks , 2 ) it is tightly integrated with the b&n ; ebook store , 3 ) the ebooks are encrypted in a format that is portable across multiple devices so they can be decrypted and read in , say , your ipad is nook reader software , or even in a sony reader ( with the very latest firmware ) , without having to be because of drm nonsense
the problem is that the nook simply doesn not live up to its promise
the "" display is more an , and reflects light in a way that makes it hard to read with a reading light ( necessary because it has no backlight , as is true for all epaper devices )
it is heavy and the buttons to change pages are hard to push , especially with gloved hands as you might have while reading outdoors on a cool day
the "5 day battery life" in reality for me has been a battery life , read a book , and it needs to be recharged , and be darn sure to turn it off
the thing freezes up and crashes all the time even with the very latest software , and is excruciatingly slow even with the very latest software
the latest software added classifications for the ebooks so you could sort them into , which is necessary given how excruciatingly slow the nook is to scroll through its book list ( get about <NUM> books on the list and you are in for major pain ) , but the clunky way they implemented this makes those of us who have gotten used to modern user interfaces frown and shake our heads
sad to say , i really can not recommend any current ebook reader
either they are too clumsy to use ( nook ) , have no books available for them ( sony ) , or have a proprietary ebook format that locks you into a single vendor ( kindle )
i am seriously considering buying an ipad , yes , it will only work for <NUM> hours or so on a battery charge , but that is true of the nook too in real actual use and the ipad is usable for a lot of other things too
it is just disappointing that i can not get an reader that meets my criteria ( ebook format , long battery life , compact , decent user interface ) , and instead have things either crippled by bad design decisions or crippled by having a proprietary ebook format that locks you into a single vendor
well , i don not like crippled , so i will look elsewhere , thank you very much .
i purchased the kindle 1 , then a bebook ( because it reads pdfs ) , and now a kindle dx for the
the nook looks so cool , until you own one
heavy copy protection , even on public domain books is ridiculous
and , from what i am reading on the web , the books are encoded with a person is credit card # and other personal info
hackers can rejoice if i loose my nook
anyway , books are still cheaper on amazon
the color touch screen is cool , until you realize that it takes up soooo much of the reading area and
costs battery ! maybe next year , the nook will be ready for prime time .
first let me say that when the nook first came out on the market it caught my eye
i begin to research e readers
i even went to the store and tested the nook , played with it
i went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well
then one of my coworkers showed me her kindle and i was able to play with it and look at it
then the i pad came out , so i went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well
i have read review after review and watched
well the holidays came and my husband bought me the nook ! i was so excited ! i wanted the nook as soon as i saw it , but took my time and compared it to other e readers
i knew right from the start which e reader i wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them
right out of the box the nook , made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the nook
my husband knew that i wanted it , but i waited trying to justify why i needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations
the nook did exactly that ! for me the nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase
here is why i love the nook , i can lend books to other , i can download from my library which is so awesome ! i can surf the net for free ! no monthly fees like the i pad , it fits in my computer bag , purse , which makes it so easy to take with me , it has my favorite games , chess and sukodu ! it was easy for me to download a ebook that i already have , but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around , the book loaded right from my lap top to the nook in no time
the amount of free books that are available to the nook , and the daily free treats from barnes and nobles ! which will more than pay for the nook over time
being able to call barnes and nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service
i also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks ! for me it was the right choice for our family , as when we go to barnes and nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks ! it pays for itself
these are some of the reason why i love my nook and i am excited that i received the nook for a gift ! i can not say enough about the nook , i don not have to be tied to one book store like itunes , ibook , are the kindle store
i don not like limits and the nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from
now with that said , when i visited my local barnes and nobles and received a free smoothie , it was so stress free and everyone was so nice
i could not believe it ! i have also downloaded music that i can listen to and have my ear plugs for that , i have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that i was shocked ! i like getting my monies worth , and not having to pay extra monthly fees
now with that said , i hope that when you do your research you will consider the nook , i am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews
well back to my nook , as i can not put it down ! what a great gift , and a great buy !
i got my nook /3g about <NUM> months ago , and i love it ! i researched alot of ereaders before making the decision to buy the nook ; in fact , i originally bought a kindle from a local store , but never took it out of the box , and returned it to purchase the nook
i originally decided to go with the 3g for two reasons ; 1 ) i wasn not sure i could set up my home to work with the nook , and 2 ) i wanted to be able to purchase books from absolutely anywhere
and i have been glad i chose that ; i have yet to purchase a book over just the
i was at a doctors office recently , waiting and waiting and waiting , and it was wonderful to be able to shop , buy a book , and start it while enduring the endless waiting
the customer service from barnes and noble is great , all i have to do is walk in the store with my nook and the employees are knowledgable and helpful for helping with the nook
also , the store nearest me has "classes" on saturday afternoons for nook/nookcolor owners , and i found that to be very helpful when i first purchased my nook
speaking of the physical store , i also like that i can read any book for free for up to an hour a day in the store
that gives me the opportunity to read alot more of a book than just what they provide as a "free sample" and lets me decide whether to purchase the book or not
i have looked at the newest generation nook , which has just recently become available , and i am glad i got my nook when i did ; i like it so much better than any ereader i have looked at
i can drop my nook in my purse , and anytime i am stuck somewhere and want to read , i have got a whole library right there with me
the nook is awesome !
pros : very nice display , clear than sony
<NUM> star for this
cons : touch screen not responsive , navigation is not good
it is a stupid to have two screen for read and menu
waste spaces
software looks buggy , very irresponsive even if updated the firmware to latest 1
, <NUM> star for this
final star 3 .
i have been super happy with this reader
in the bright sun sitting outside , no problem
on the many flights i take , no problem
b&n ; site and downloading books is a breeze
i have got a droid x phone , and the accounts sync , so i can quickly pull up the same book on my phone with the nook app , very cool
i can lend , and have others lend me , some of the books purchased
our local library in central texas , outside austin , is connected to overdrive
with my library card i can download epub books and check them out , anywhere i have got internet
i don not have to check them back in , they just go away after the check out period
same with audiobooks
nook handles this format , other ereaders do not , so you might want to look into this option and what formats the readers have before making a decision
i like the onscreen keyboard/touch screen , personally
it is bright and easy in areas where dimly lit and the light in your reader case is directed at the reading screen
seems like no big deal , but after <NUM> hours on a plane you get tired and this makes a difference
not a bunch of keys to hit/press with the keyboard exposed
this is a personal opinion , and i can absolutely understand why others may want the keyboard
i put in pagemarks etc on books , but don not type a lot of notes into the ebooks when reading
if you do a lot of this , you may want to test run the onscreen keyboard and see if you like it
i don not , the amount of typing is very limited , so onscreen is perfect and i am used to it with my phones
using this over wifi to surf the internet is something you can do , but it isn not the best
you can in a pinch , but it is easier for me to pull out my smartphone and crank into a website
the number of places to get books , especially free ones , is awesome with the nook handling so many formats
b&n ; just search 0
00 and titles and you will get thousands of classics come up that copyright is over and they are free
org is puts free classics by the tens of thousands out that you can download onto your nook for free , google books does this and a few other sites
tons and tons of books for free , i haven not read tom sawyer in 20+ years and am now , for free
just an addition to note
lots of periodicals , newspapers etc , that you can get daily
i take my kids into b&n ; and they love to look through the kids books
while there , i can read any book over their wifi for free for up to an hour
i don not use this a lot , but once a month or so when i take the kids , it is pretty cool
overall , i am really pysched , this nook has been awesome .
most of the other reviews have the details about what is good and bad in their opinion , and most of it is accurate
the battery life is misrepresented by b&n
; the only way you could possibly get <NUM> days out of the battery is if it is off
however , <NUM> to <NUM> days is a real possibility , so , bring your charger or usb to computer cable
just like apple ipod , the b&n ; folks decided to use a usb cable that appears to match the apple ones
this is a minor problem , but do not expect to borrow a usb cable from someone while on travel
the included small charger worked very well
the key thing is how does the nook function as a book reader
in my opinion , it is adequate , and no more
i downloaded a number of free books without any problem
i also downloaded some paid books form b&n
; once again , no problem
finally , i downloaded some books from my public library onto my computer ( not the nook ) using the free adobe software
using the usb cable to my nook , i simply dragged the books to the nook , and voila , two seocnds later they were available for <NUM> days
so far so good
one could now rant about the interface ( ) , or the fact that you should reduce the brightness to about <PERCENT> to save the battery as well as turn off the when not in use , and so forth , but how does it work when reading a book
if you are like me , and read fairly fast , most books will be a real page turners , since there is not much on a page compared to a real print on paper book
the print is clear
it is faily black on a slightly grey background ( some might say ) , which under a bright reading light is quite comfortable
for the eyesight challenged , there are bigger fonts accompanied with still more page turning
the same is true of the kindle
page turning is easy and intuitive , so not a problem
use the buttons on the side , not the color interface
a big feature of the nook is the ability to add a memory card
well it is true you can do this , but it is not for the faint of heart or fingernail impaired
the first time you try to open the nook using the nearly invisible tab , you will wonder if you are going to break the cover
just be careful , follow the instructions , and all will be well
now , why would you want to add memory
as it arrives , the nook holds a huge number of books
you might want to add some of your work in pdf documents - this chews up space fast - and the pdf reading capability is primitive at best
get a small netbook for this purpose and leave the nook for books
changing the ! perhaps at the end of life , <NUM> to <NUM> years , to save a service trip
by then the technology will be antique , and you will replace the whole nook , not just the battery
a disappointment is the lack of even a primitive browser so that you could check email without lugging along another computer
the kindle has this feature
the nook can be "upgraded" to also have a browser , but then it is , and you might have trouble as b&n ; upgrades the official firmware
perhaps b&n ; will relent and give us email capability similar to the apple
i can understand not wanting to overload at&t ; with too much traffic , but simple text emails should not have been a problem
finally , why would you want a nook in the first place
remember , real books use no power , are truly random access , can be lent to anyone for as long as you like , and will function far into the future regardless of technology changes
the only purpose i can see for having a nook is for travel and for electronically borrowing books from a library without getting into your car or walking overmuch
well , scratch the last , since you can borrow and read books on your computer
the airplane travel or train commute is a biggie
books are heavy and bulky
carrying <NUM> books onto an airplane is a pain
plus , hauling out your nook to read makes you look technically cool , and for the short term , is sure to start a conversation with a nearby stranger
the conversation might be interesting and better than the you were going to read
well , i have written enough and am going to read a book that i just downloaded from the local library
i will try not spill my soup on the nook while reading and eating -or it would become a .
i bought the original nook in aug
initially , i liked it , but i quickly learned that the battery life wasn not nearly the quoted time ( it lasts about <NUM> days for me , <NUM> max with wireless off and the most settings )
the /lcd screen mix was nice for navigation , although i understand that the newer touch models will be more
despite this drawback , it was so much more convenient than paperbacks
as much as i love the feel of books , in a nyc apartment , there just isn not all that much room for them ! that nook lived for about <NUM> months until a part of the screen died - just black pixels
i called customer service and after a long painful process , got it replaced
the unit i got was clearly a refurbished unit , which wouldn not have bothered me , had it been identical to the one i sent it
my original nook had a screen , this new nook had a screen and its' buttons squeaked when pressed
little did i know at the time that this was the sign of a very important defect ! as it happened , this isqueaking' , which made the buttons difficult to press , also caused the buttons to crack just one month past warranty
needless to say , i wasn not delighted
apparently , the buttons cracking is a very common defect
so if you buy a nook , remember this : if the button squeaks and is hard to press , it will break
return it while you can
not all the nooks are like this ( my old one wasn not ) , so i recommend checking it out
overall - 3/5 - it is a solid reading device but doesn not really compare to the nook simple touch/kindle touch devices or even the kindle <NUM> keyboard ( which i now also own ) .
i bought a nook today
the one and only reason i chose nook ( instead of just sticking with and upgrading my beloved old kindle 1 ) is its ability to download books from the public library
tomorrow i am taking the nook back to best buy for a refund , not an exchange
the nook is attractive and nicely packaged
i completely expected it to just work , like my kindle did ( and still does ) and all of my apple products do
but , like so many other reviewers here , my nook never even got up and running before it croaked
first , it would not complete the registration process
i have an active account on b&n ; and strong wifi in my home , plus this nook also has 3g so there were not any connection problems
then , when i decided to just register later and moved on to explore how the nook worked , it froze
could not reboot or turn it off by holding down power key as suggested in the troubleshooting help/support on the b&n ; website
it did not work
i do not want to mess with taking the back off , using little screwdrivers or whatever to take out ( the fully charged ) battery , etc
we should not have to do that on a brand new 200
00 product ! so , am taking it back and won not buy another until they improve the quality of the thing
i never had one bit of trouble with my trusty kindle , and would not even be looking at another brand of reader except for kindle is inability to download library books
i am giving the nook two stars instead of one because , if it actually worked , it looks like it would be a nice ereader and it has a more open format than kindle does
update : 1/28/11went to return the nook for a refund today and at the last minute decided to give it another go , so did exchange instead
tonight charged and powered up the replacement nook , so far so good
it works perfectly
registration was smooth and fast , wifi connected easily with my signal , downloaded a book quickly , and navigation is a breeze
no problems encountered yet except that it is not downloading an available firmware update , and there is probably some explanation for that so not a big deal
so , i might just end up keeping this baby as a companion to my kindle
love having the nook with its open format for library and other downloads
will see how it holds up over the next several weeks and then update my rating accordingly
update : 2/3/11returned the nook to best buy today and bought a kindle <NUM> through amazon
after exchanging the first defective nook then using its replacement for several days i found that the device worked pretty much as it was supposed to
there are a couple of minor things about it that i was not crazy about and probably would have gotten used to , but there is one problem ( design flaw ? ) that for me is definitely a deal killer
one of the minor annoyances is that there is a lot of screen flash during any menu change
another is that the color , lighted touch screen control at the bottom of the device is distracting when it lights up at any touch during reading
and after a while i was not that crazy about the menu navigation either , seemed like too many steps and screen flashes , but probably could have gotten used to that too
i would not have rejected the nook just over those little quirks
the big reason that the nook was no way going to work out for me is , again , that touch screen display at the bottom of the device
it is , like an ipad , highly reflective
so what that means is that when the screen is off , which it is most all of the time during reading , you can watch yourself read ! the black screen reflects anything in front of it , almost like a dark mirror
that was a no go for me , no i did not like it at all
aside from these annoyances , the nook did well at everything it was designed to do
so will upgrade the rating to reflect ( haha ) that
i have to say that i am much happier with the kindle , but amazon really needs to get with the program and let kindle use the epub format
they will eventually lose me and a lot of other prospective customers over the epub problem , it is that big of a deal
yet another update ! 5/31/11caved in and purchased another nook last week
i still love my kindle and prefer it over nook , but just could not wait another minute for amazon to open kindle to epub for downloading public library books
so , last week when b&n ; had nooks for sale cheap on their ebay website ( 99
00 , free ship , 3g/wifi , , refurb w/ full warranty ) i jumped on it
this refurb nook worked much better out of the box than my initial brand new device purchased then returned back in jan/feb
i am using the nook just for library books , and it does what it is supposed to do
navigation works well , but seems like it requires more step than kindle
still do not like the reflective color screen below the reading area
there is one thing that i do like better on nook , the screen background is a paler gray than kindle making for easier reading in low light
i will keep this nook until amazon does epub , then stick with kindle .
there are a multitude of reviews that compare and contrast the nook and kindle , so i am not going to go into a comparison and review
i am going to focus on my experience owning both , most specifically battery life and availability of books
my husband uses the kindle and i use the nook
the reason i went with the nook is because initially i was very "anti" book
he wanted a kindle and i sneered at the idea
i was being a book snob and didn not like the idea of books in electronic format , so i snubbed my nose at it
however , after we took a vacation and he had his kindle loaded with books , and i had big paper books , i began to reconsider my position
upon return from our vacation i elected to get a nook
i did so because i liked the idea of the touch screen at the bottom rather than the keyboard , which i thought made the kindle look klunky
i thought overall that the nook was more aesthetically pleasing
so - i ordered the nook
there are two major things that the kindle has on the nook , and that is far superior battery life , and significantly more books available for download - especially so if you read
the battery life on my nook is awful
so much so that i ordered a new battery thinking perhaps i had a dud
nope - it is performance is just the same
if i am actively reading a book i have to recharge every <NUM> days
if i don not read it for days it will drain on it is own
comparing this to my husband is kindle , he can go an entire <NUM> week trip reading books daily without having to recharge his kindle ! it takes a couple months to drain with no usage
the kindle is battery life is more than my nook
i have serious battery life envy
for that alone i have begun to covet his kindle
the second bummer is that most of the available books for nook are fiction
there are some of the more popular type books available
usually whatever is most trendy at the time , but for the most part any professional type texts , or anything not on a best seller list that is can not be found for the nook platform
however , when i go to amazon , <NUM> of <NUM> times , i will find it available for download on the kindle
but ! one thing about this is that for me , i tend to mark up and highlight my books a lot because i am using them for reference sources
it is very difficult to quickly retrieve highlighted text from the electronic source compared to my real , paper books
so i have actually come to realize that i'd likely be purchasing my as real paper books anyways , so that i can have them for ready reference and mark them up with my highlights and little flags ( yes - i am a geek who uses the little flag tabs to mark pages in my books ! ) so , i am now fine with the fact that i can not readily download to my nook and instead i continue to buy them as regular , paper books
as i said above , i'd likely buy my as real books anyways since i use them as references
i now download all my fiction books to the nook
so it is become my source for pleasure reading , which is great , since that is the kind of stuff i take with me when i travel or about town anyways , and can just stuff the nook in my purse
however , i very much envy the battery life of the kindle ! if i could stuff a kindle battery into my nook i'd be a super happy girl
if i had it to do over i'd likely buy a kindle for myself despite it is less aesthetically pleasing appearance
the battery life and availability of books is far superior to the nook .
had this for sevral months now and i love it
i love the touch screen which lets me see the covers of books in color ! very easy to set up account with b&n ; using my nook
it serches for and is very easy
anytime i have had any problem , a simple fixes it
i love the "free friday" that is offered
i have read sooo many books since i bought it
i also think i would like the "lend me" option if any of my friends had a nook .
pros : eink display preserves traditional reading experience and has great clarity and contrast
reads pdf ( both scanned and standard text ) and epub book formats with no hassles or conversion required
help and extra features from b&n
; page turning speed is much improved with most recent update
android os allows for almost unlimited software improvements and added features
replacement batteries can be bought and installed easily
accepts sd cards for increased storage capacity ( this really comes in handy if you want to use the device as an mp3 player or for audiobooks )
cons : eink display requires you to operate at a bit slower pace than the touchscreen alone would allow
( also : not sure why the price from this supplier is abnormally high ? ) i have played with an ipad and it is a very fun device
but what i don not like is a glowing backlit screen , as i look at a monitor all day
when i read , i want to relax and give my eyes a break , and that is why i prefer eink displays
the nook is primary advantage over the kindle is that it allows you to read epub and pdf books ( scanned or text ; either works ) and buy books from various online ebook stores , including the sony reader store
this has already allowed me to read two titles that i wouldn not have been able to get for the kindle
it also works very easily with adobe digital editions software , a huge plus
currently amazon offers some titles that b&n ; does not ( a very temporary state of affairs , i suspect ) , but those are usually available from sony
add the book loan feature , free library books , and the ability to take it to a b&n ; store for bonus features , and this unit pretty much stomps the kindle and sony readers
the nook is a little slower than a phone or your other electronic devices due to the screen , but once you get used to it , the device seems very smooth
in fact , i find that having to slow down a little actually helps me relax , and once you master turning pages with a quick brush of the thumb across the touchscreen , reading with the nook is a very pleasant experience
i now prefer it to reading books in print , to be perfectly honest .
i have had my nook for a week now and just love it
i find the touchscreen easy to understand and use
i have downloaded books from the local public library using overdrive and adobe digital edition and all have come through perfectly
downloading books from b & n have been quick and efficient
i like being able to find/search forward and backward and to be able to look up words easily
i have used bookmarks and highlights as well
i also like the feature of being able to go to last read page or to quickly pick a page using the go to
i have downloaded my own wallpaper and screen savers
the two reasons i chose the nook over the kindle : local support at barnes and noble and the ability to borrow ebooks from the public library
i also easily added my own microsd card and added personal pdf documents to it
i love reading on it !
i will continue to update this review as i discover new features of the nook , so stay tuned folks ! *updated 02/08/2010*i have been using my nook with the newest update ( v 1
2 ) for a few days now
this is the second update to the nook since launch
all i can say is thank you barnes & noble ! the lcd screen improvements alone are great ! with better looking icons , more responsiveness , and a sleeker appearance -- it makes me think of that mcdonald is commercial : i am lovin' it ! several of the well documented issues have been fixed , such as losing bookmarks due to powering off the unit -- which as it turns out was the most cited problem for nook bashers and haters alike
nook haters will also be disappointed that the battery life has been optimized too
if you have been waiting for the minor 1
0 issues to be fixed prior to purchasing the nook you will not be disappointed in this newest version
and if you have been considering switching from the kindle you would be well advised to do so at this point
*updated 01/31/2010*this device is clearly the best option on the market today , with it is lcd touchscreen , , memory expansion capabilities , and so , so much more
let is "wade in the weeds" and look at some of the features in detail : lcd touchscreenso far this is the only mainstream reader to offer a lcd screen of any kind
the book cover listing is beautiful , elegant , and functional
with the newest update it is uber fast , intuitive , and responsive
page turns are super easy with the touchscreen , all you have to do is swipe the screen with one finger when it is in standby mode and the page turns
in addition , it is easier for me to navigate books via the lcd than textually
seeing the cover is a really nice feature , since books are designed to pique your interest by the cover
it just seems like a good cover sells a book , and seeing that cover in crisp lcd sells me from time to time
the keyboard is nice , any time a text field comes up you will have the keyboard pop up on queue
it is fast , responsive , and best of all doesn not look like a 1970 is era fax machine keypad like some of the older readers on the market
built in is one of the great features of this device
modern 3g speeds are pretty fast , but as most of us know that have smartphones , is about <NUM> times faster , especially when one tries to download large things , or a lot of content
the on this device is no exception
it is fast and super easy to set up
the on screen instructions are sooo clear to follow
i couldn not imagine only having 3g these days , like when you are in an area that doesn not have 3g coverage , you can still use the nook over
this is truly one of the killer features of the nook
you can go into a b&n ; store and to your hearts content , but then come home and do the same
hotels offering free are the nooks biach
memory expansionthe nook has a card slot which accepts up to 16gb cards , this allows you to upgrade your memory indefinitely
another advantage would be to organize your books
and books on the card are never going to get lost if your reader dies -- without having to from the cloud
plus with the new b&n ; desktop reader you can move your books from the nook to a laptop/netbook on the fly , and what if the worst should happen and your ereader dies ? you still have those books on the card
appearancethis is a biggy for me as it is for most people
i don not tend to buy or use things that look ugly
that is why i have got an ipod instead of a zune , why i have got a lcd tv instead of a crt , and now why i have got a nook instead of another reader
the appearance of this device can be described with one word , sexy
it just looks good
other readers currently available range from looking "not too bad" to looking downright ugly
this reader is the exception to that rule and employs a host of features to boot
book formats and availabilitythis is probably the biggest of all the features , since we are talking about a book reader , the nook boasts a whopping 1 , 000 , 000 books available for it , in readily readable format , from just two sources ( b&n ; and google )
the nearest competitor only offers 500 , 000 books in it is native format ( kindle )
you can convert many books to a kindle readable format , but it is a hassle and you have to use your computer to do that
sort of defeats the purpose of the wireless if you have to constantly connect to the pc
and there are third party sources for books in kindle format , probably websites you have never heard of , new sites pop up all the time since kindle has a big install base , but the quality of books on those sites is in question compared to a reputable company like google
eink displayit seems to be crisper than much of the competition out there
the ability to change the typeface and size of the fonts is wonderful
the nearest competitors screen almost seems fuzzy in comparison , which for me makes it harder to read
page changes are fast on the nook , while nothing can compare with the speed of changing a real books' page , it is fast enough for the average person
speed readers may find themselves waiting for a few milliseconds though
the controls on the nook are straightforward and intuitive
replacable batterythis is another biggy for most ebook people , with the nook you can change the battery out should you a ) want extended reading times without charge , or b ) if the original battery dies for some reason
many of the other readers on the market do not allow this , which means they are bricked if the battery dies and will either have to be repaired or replaced
battery lifea lot has been said about the battery life of the nook , and other ereaders
all of the manufacturers of these devices overstate the real world battery life in real world useage situations
i have a with one of the amazon ( kindle brand ) ereaders and he has to charge every <NUM> - <NUM> days
nook lasts for me about <NUM> - <NUM> days , but it all depends on what features you use on either or any of the devices and how much you use them to determine actual , real world battery usage
either way , all of these devices are easy to charge
just plug into a standard <NUM> - <NUM> outlet and presto ! or in the case of the nook , you can also plug into your computer/laptop/netbook and voila ! you will be on go in no time flat
ease of usethe nook is easy to set up and use , the onscreen keyboard is more familiar and similar to modern devices than many of the competitors setups
summarythere are so many features of this device it is hard to capture them all in one review
all in all this is one great device , with it is ipod like look and feel , large number of built in features , and industry standard operating system , it is clearly the choice of discerning electronics customers
*update*so , i had been told on these comments that the b&n ; in store functionality was not ready to be used yet -- another lie dispelled today
i stopped in at the b&n ; in hillsboro and it is in fact fully functional
my nook immediately recognized the b&n ; network and connected without me even having to tell it to ! as it turns out there is exclusive content at each b&n ; store , at this particular one there were multiple books that could be downloaded for free ! so , seeing one that piqued my interest i naturally downloaded it
wow , super fast and convenient , and free !
the nook is the best yet
it replaces the keyboard on the kindle with a color touch screen about the size of the iphone display
this makes it easy to maneuver between the store , your library , your current book , the daily ( with messages , newsletters , and other free content ) , and settings
the lcd display changes from menu items to images of book covers to a keyboard as needed , and then turns off when reading
you can connect by both wifi and free 3g to download a purchase in seconds , and connect with wifi to get content and other offers when you walk into a b&n ; store
i am using the latest 1
1 sw release that fixes most of the issues noted in early reviews
updates are done automatically over the air
the nook feels great in the hand with a slightly contoured back that adds a little thickness for the hand to grip
controls are provided for equal usability by a left or person
the back is removable and replaceable with different colors
they are all rubber coated to make it less likely to drop
unlike the kindle the battery is replaceable and the memory is expandable
the display is the same type , but appears to be slightly crisper than the kindle 2
the nook supports epub ( non or adobe drm ) , pdb ( non drm ) , pdf , graphics : jpg , gif , png , bmp , audio : mp3 , pdb
the online b&n ; bookstore has about a million books compared to the kindle store with half that , the major difference being the free public domain books provided by google
summary : while it costs the same as the kindle , the nook is loaded with extra features : wifi , color lcd , removable battery , expandable memory , more open book formats
you can customize your nook with your own photos to create personal screen savers and lend between nook , iphone , a pc and a mac .
this is a good item
even though it is old , it is sticks to what an reader should be
it really is good for just reading books
it has great battery and the 3g works everywhere
i already own a + 3g kindle and had compared reviews between the nook and kindle extensively , before buying the kindle
but because the nook allows you to borrow books from the local library for free , and my wife was hogging the kindle , i decided to try a nook , at a reduced price
while the kindle is clearly a superior product , ( lighter , faster , easier to use and much longer battery life ) , i found the nook okay at the price i paid
it was a little difficult to learn how to navigate with the touch screen and the seemed ponderous , but once i got the hang of it , i have borrowed a book a week from the library
the reduced price for the product was because someone had returned it and it presumably had been repaired
i haven not found anything wrong with it and it looked new , unscratched and unmarked , so as a to a kindle , i'd recommend it
i am getting about days of battery life in "airplane mode" ( and 3g turned off ) , and that is enough to finish a book without recharging
i am not rating reliability , because i have only had it for about a month .
if i had known that the 3g is not good for anything except purchasing books ( yes i know it is my fault for not doing more research ) , i would not have paid more for the 3g version as i don not need the ability to get books anytime anywhere
the web browser only works on wifi
anyway , i really like the nook
i bought a refurb from one of those daily deal sites for a very good price
i have only had it for about a week so i can not speak for it is reliability but i have loaded lots of free ebooks ( what i bought it for ) from various sources , some audio books for my kids , and some music
i like the web browser and the sudoku game
the only thing i would change if i could is to have an option to combine the "my b&n library" with "my documents" because when you get books from anywhere else besides b&n , it goes to your documents
i would like to be able to pull up my "mysteries" shelf and be able to see all of my mysteries not just the "documents" set or the "b&n" set
i think it would make it more user friendly to have that be an option ( only an option since some people probably like it the way it is )
it is a bit heavier than i thought it would be but not unmanageable
i haven not used the library yet but have gotten epub books elsewhere ( the epub ability is the reason i chose nook over kindle even though there are a lot more free kindle books )
overall , yes i would recommend a nook but i would have gone for the cheaper wifi version had i known that the 3g was useless to me .
n my honest opinion nook is unfinished product
none of my technical books in pdf format i was able to read due to pdf reader rendering formulas all over the screen with font
i am able to see formulas in small font but then the rest of text is unreadable
formula rendering in medium font is a mess however text is readable
i would have expected developer of the device spent more time on the text rendering on ebook reader
other issue is font randomly changing from small to medium in pdf format .
my wife has had a nook for a few months and loves it
i ordered one thinking it would be great
it arrived and i loaded a part of my book collection and immediately ran into trouble
if i loaded a few books all went well but when i tried to load about one hundred it gave me a message that it was looking for new items
i don not know where it went looking but it was a long long trip
ten hours later it was still out looking
i tried everything including customer service
emailed - never heard from them
phoned and the tech blamed me , the books etc but never the nook
resulting conclusion from him was that i should buy books from barnes and noble so they would work
i asked why they advertized that it would read
pdf and
he said , well , most of the time it reads them
phoned tech again and this one said that it was defective and set up a replacement
replacement came and it was doing the same thing
i left it for nearly twelve hours and nothing happening
i googled and found others are having the same problem , some believe it is related to the new update barnes and noble put out
i am no longer concerned as it is on the way back .
i won not rehash the nook vs
kindle issue , but we will say i chose to buy the nook because it just sounded better based on what people were saying
however - i'd say i made a huge mistake
i loved the way the nook worked , but reliability becamea huge issue
my first nook died within <NUM> hours
i figured it was just a bad egg , took it back , and they completely replaced it with a brand new one
my second one died <NUM> months later
i took it to two different stores and they were unable to fix it
since it is still under warranty , they advised i call or email
over the last <NUM> months , i have sent several emails and get saying they have a higher volume of messages than usual , please call
i have also racked up tons of cell phone minutes trying to call and have yet to break through before my lunch break is over , or my toddler starts wanting my attention , etc
i guess i will just chalk it up to a total waste of my money and start saving for a kindle !
i wondered if this is designed solely for reading books/magazines
i have some books with i purchased are in pdf
plus i have some word documents which i have converted to pdf
both in my books and in my files have lot of pictures
lot of the data are tabular representation are actually pictures
when i read them in nook , the letters in the pictures are virtually unreadable as they are too small
when i try to increase the font size , it does not work
it works only for texts ! i have never used kindle so don not know if the issue is there in kindle too
also the pdf pages are scattered all over the place
<NUM> page in actual pdf file appears as <NUM> pages sometimes with a blank page in between
not sure what is causing this
my nook does have a web browser but it only works with , not with the 3g
in 3g you can only interact with barnesandnobles
comthe touch screen response and are ok
not great , after dealing with much more faster and better touch screens we use
go for it ( and kindle ) if you are reading text only book with very little or no graphics
amazon and b&n ; needs to improve their products and i am sure they will !
i got the nook the day before nook color was announced
i actually waited until the nook color was announced before opening the box - i wanted to see what the new gadget had to offer and if it'd be worth trading mine in
there were some rumors that the nook color would feature a screen with mirasol technology , and i was disappointed to learn that it actually had an lcd screen coated with something to reduce glare
i state at an lcd screen all day at work , and don not want to do the same while reading
plus , i am not sure how well the lcd screen would fare in the sun and i am interested to hear feedback from nook color owners
i think the color screen matters if you want to read a lot of magazines , or textbooks , or kids' books , none of which i will be doing
nook color also stores more books ( 6000 ) and allows the reader to send updates to facebook and twitter directly from the ereader
personally , i didn not find any of these extra features particularly appealing , so i am happily sticking with the original nook
my observations/pros of the is bigger than i expected , in a good way
it is not heavy , but has a nice "significant" feel to it
-i think few people realize how clear and the screen actually is
i showed the nook to some friends , and that was the first thing they noticed
-the bottom lcd adds a little oomph with the color buttons and book covers
-getting epub books from the public library has been surprisingly easy , although you have to connect the nook to a computer in order to transfer the epub files
-i have been enjoying the nook facebook group where administrators post a free ebook every friday
-the instructional videos online are very helpful in getting started with the nook
com has a free nookbooks section , but for some reason , not all the free ebooks are listed
i saw some kindle titles that were available for free , and when i searched on bn
com , turns out they were free there as well
-i didn not care much about the lendme feature of the nook , but it was still disappointing to learn that not all purchased ebooks can be lent out
publishers control which titles can be used for lending , and each book can only be lent out once
-the pdf manual for the nook is very confusing and can benefit from some serious editing
-there are definitely more kindle books than nookbooks available , but i hope that will change in the near future
all in all , i am pretty happy with the nook and i think the fact that it supports a wider range of ebook formats outweighs many of the cons
i like not being tied down to one proprietary format and being able to check out ebooks from the library is priceless to me .
very happy with the purchase of the nook
wonderful minimalist design lends well to an - it is easy to hold and is the perfect size for those used to the size of a paperback ( slightly larger , yes , but certainly not as large as the kindle or the ipad )
i am tired of these negative reviews about devices that are defective - yes , we all get electronics that go bad , but really , can not you talk about the functionality of the device a bit ? anyway , the device isn not perfect ( interface not as smooth as the ipad ) , but for the price and functionality it is great
i can read borrowed from my local library , have free 3g service when i am out and about , and i like the fact that the reading screen is not touch based ( avoids fingerprints )
all in all , worth the price .
perfect , as described thank you
great product great sale , i just love this product , and my children will too i want one for myself this is suppose to be their christmas gift but i want one now .
the nook hd is a great $100 book reader
it is sometimes on sale for even less at barnes & noble stores
it is not an apple ipad , but it will let you check email , surf the internet , listen to music on pandora or watch movies on netflix
barnes & noble stores have free classes to teach you how to use your nook and most have an expert in the store every day to answer questions
an owner is manual is provided in the nook is preloaded library
work through the manual page by page to learn all of its features
add a 32gb or 64gb memory card and carry your favorite movies on vacation .
it is a fine tablet
the screen is excellent
the speakers are very good
the interface is a little clunky but easy to use
it does just what i want it to do and it does it well .
i couldn not have asked for a better product ! i upgraded from the nook color to the hd and i am super happy !
i had to put generic android on it because barnes and noble had it so hamstrung
should have gone with the new 7&<HASHTAG> ; nexus
no built in gps turned out to be a major lack .
i am already a kindle owner and i love my kindle
the kindle does have some limitations , most especially in the handling of pdfs
the kindle does not annotate and curate highlighted text of pdf is you upload
this is where i found the nook hd more useful , apart from the fact that it gives you full access to the play store
in handling big pdf is , the nook hd is slow and the highlighting of scanned pdf is is not very smooth
i really tried to love the nook but did not and so i did not use it beyond the first month
i will not recommend the nook
if your goal is the android store , just get a nexus tablet and download b&n app
it is cheap and works much better than the nook .
when attempting to live chat with their customer service , i was ignored <NUM> times where the other agent never responded and then the chat timed out , and had the session terminated <NUM> times for some unknown reason right after their standard "it is not really broken" response was written
all because i wanted to know why my the touch screen on my nook stopped responding to input
then i called and was literally cussed ( f word ) at a minute in for asking about what was wrong with their live chat
maybe i was just really unlucky and the person i talked to was angry or planning on quitting or something , but i still find it unacceptable
seriously , go with a kindle or something else instead
amazon is customer service has always been well above average for me .
i had given my kids a nook color a couple years ago
sold it last fall and got <NUM> girl a kindle fire 2nd gen , and the other a lenovo a2107
the lenovo was absolutely horrid so i wanted to replace it
this summer , when the nook hd got google play , and the prices fell , i sold the lenovo and got my daughter the nook hd 16gb snow
she absolutely loves it ! i liked it so much , i got the nook hd 8gb for myself
i like it much better than my kindle fire hd
the size is smaller , and thinner , and lighter , which are great things
and you can put whatever wallpaper you want on it , unlike the fire hd
i sold the 2nd gen kindle fire and gave the other daughter the fire hd , but she has since switched to a nook also ( hd+ )
so now i have the fire hd and the nook hd for myself
i like the nook hd better for the reasons stated above
size and weight are so much smaller on the nook hd
the screen resolution is also better
there is nothing i don not like about the nook hd
i did put a greatshield glare screen protector on the nooks , to reduce the shiny glare
we use them without cases , just sleeves
they are phenomenal tablets
if you or the person you are buying for loves to play games and will likely download hundreds of them , definitely get the 16gb nook hd
you will want as much space for apps as you can afford , despite the sd card slot
games have to be installed to internal memory , for the most part
the sd card slot comes in handy for books , movies , photos and music
i got the <NUM> gb nook hd for myself , because i don not play games , the only apps i need are for reading , playing music , news , web , stuff like that
i put my files on the sd card and i am set ! i don not plan to buy the new fires when they come out
they are far too limited , in my opinion
( so was the nook , of course , until they added google play )
i have adw launcher on all three of the nooks , though my daughters tend to prefer the standard nook launcher
what shows up on that home page can be customized to show only what you want it to show
there is also an "app drawer" icon that shows the most recently opened apps for easy launching
it really is a great design , and far superior to the tiresome carousel on the kindle fires .
i bought this for a friend who studies programming using while he is at work ( repairing cars ) - and he loves it .
bought it for my wife to use primarily as a reader but also to occasionally access the net and read email when not at her computer
she absolutely loves it
it is the perfect product for her
the reader portion is excellent
the web graphics are vivid and colorful
it has great functionality for such a small machine and last but not least , the price is right .
exactly the same as from barnes and noble but less expensive
it has been working great and doing more than i even needed
wow ! arrived on time , i was a bit worried about the packaging as it came in a bubble envelope in its nook box , but everything was fine .
she has been using a nook for several years
i decided to get her the tablet because she wants to read email and browse as well as read her ebooks
her little smart phone was just too small to use
now she is using it regularly to browse and can easily read her gmail .
this is a very good tablet for reading
satisfied with my purchase
very handy and easy to tucked in your purse or in your hands
just convenient for my need .
brand loyalty aside , the nook hd and the kindle fire hd are both great products
i have a barnes & noble store about one mile away
i called with some typical learning curve operating questions and was treated with courtesy and competence
my after my poor effort to explain the issues on the phone , the local b & n nook expert offered to come in person to help me
took about <NUM> minutes
try that with amazon ! lolnow with google play
an exceptional product with exceptional people backing it up .
very good product for those with a nook book collection
works well with apps
all google play apps are available except for those requiring a camera
i brought two units for my children and there are lots of apps and books for them
the nook hd will read certain books allowed
my two units ended up being defective and kept crashing
was able to return both with no problems .
when i learned the modifications barnes & noble made to its nooks and saw the price drop , i decided to get one formy very active <NUM> grandson
he loves it
despite him being a rough & tumble outdoor boy , it has held up wellfor a few months now
i attribute this partly to solid quality build and partly to the nook hd 7&<HASHTAG> ; being so thin & lightweight
i recommend this tablet , especially for children , a much better buy than those heavier , more expensive & slower tabletssold for children .
i bought this refurb for under $100 and so glad i did ! i tried the samsung galaxy tab <NUM> ( expensive and glitchy ) , the lenvovo idea tab ( poor performance ) before i settled on the nook
after using tablets at both high and price points i figured i had nothing to lose--and was pleasantly surprised by the nook is capabilities ! on the nook i can read bn or kindle books , play scrabble from the android store , and watch netflix
more advanced features such as gps and camera are unnecessary for me , and i enjoy the simplicity of this device
it has a sturdy build and even though i did not want a white tablet ( fear of dirt ) it has not been an issue
i have had it for several months and don not feel anxious about using it without a cover
it is ease of use , clean interface , adequate battery life , and features make this a winner for me in the under $100 category
add to that bn is warranty and i am more than satisfied with my purchase
my only qualm with the nook hd is that it has a proprietary charging cable ( not a micro usb like cell phones ) so it is an extra cord to carry when traveling
in addition , it will not fit just any usb plug ( something to do with wattage , i think )
so if you plug the usb end into a travel charger or car charger it may not work
same thing with using a usb port on a computer
imo this is a major limitation for an otherwise great device , especially for someone that travels frequently .
i had a nook tablet which was fine
saw these at barnes and noble and picked some up for the kids
the difference between the hd and the table is night and day
the screen is amazing
the addition of google play makes this an incredible value in a tablet
it also turns it into a kindle
the kids are busy on all our long car rides
the sd card make it completely expandable
we can watch netflix with wi=fi or load the sd card with movies for a road trip
it is under <NUM> bucks too
great !
i got one of these for christmas , and i love it ! at first i wasn not all that fond of it because the only way to purchase apps and such was to use the nook store , but recently they had an update that added all sorts of google apps , including google playstore
it has great graphics compared to previous nook tablets
it is great to read with , but the books are a little pricey
now that it has google playstore and great graphics , i can not think of a reason for somebody not to get it !
i recently bought the nook hd white for <NUM> greenbacks from bn
i had originally purchased a kindle fire hd
the nook is lighter and the screen is brighter/sharper than the kindle fire
with the recent update to allow the full version of google play , a lot of the original limitations with the nook have gone away
the chrome browser beats silk all the way
you can actually download the kindle app from the google appstore and read all the books
however , you cannot install the amazon appstore and i had to buy some of the apps from google play that i had originally purchased
there are no ads with the nook
even with the fathers day sale ( which put the kindle version at 195 ) , this is cheaper by <NUM> bucks
an additional benefit is you can add an external sd card and there are options to boot a full blown standard android jellybean from the sd card with the nook from places like ( afn - android for nook for just <NUM> bucks )
the two main downsides are that it lacks a front facing camera , but i really have no use for that and the parental controls are not that easy to set as in the kindle ( you can create a child profile and make sure that the password has to be entered , but i have not fully figured it out )
i liked it so much that i bought a second nook in smoke color today .
pay close attention
i would be very cautious about swallowing a few of the &<HASHTAG> ; most helpful favorable reviews&<HASHTAG> ;
pay attention to that quoted phrase
i strongly suspect many are paid reviewers or actually employees or someone connected with the addons for the nook
just a &<HASHTAG> ; heads up&<HASHTAG> ;
amazon loves to put the &<HASHTAG> ; favorable&<HASHTAG> ; insiders up front because the bottom line is sales and what leaves your wallet into theirs is the driver
my nook is okay for the $79 at my local computer store that wanted to get rid of them
its not a bargain at the prices we see here
if you are serious about a tablet then save up for a good one if you can
if not , it should work for you
most folks are putting out honest reviews , some whine artists , some scammers , some who just need to talk to someone
we can not do much about that , but we can comb through and pick out what we might be able to trust .
am tired of charging cables
i like micro usb and the majority of hand held electronic devices use micro usb now
why is the nook hd using a non standard <NUM> pin charging cable ? we returned the nook to barnes and noble !
i received the basic nook as a christmas gift
never really wanted a reader or tablet
i am an book kinda gal
but , when my daughter and i decided to make a trip to spain , i returned the nook reader and decided to upgrade to the hd so that i could travel with a tablet that would enable me to check email , surf the web , and read books and magazines
i am just learning to use it but so far i think i am really going to enjoy having this tablet
the only reason i didn not give it a <NUM> star rating is because it didn not come with a manual ( i did say i was an book kinda gal )
would highly recommend the nook hd for your entry into the world of tablets and readers !
i did such extensive research trying to decide between the kindle and the nook
i settled on the nook because i had read nothing but good reviews and the price was excellent
positive : it has a beautiful screen with great vibrant color
the adjustable backlight is great for night time reading and reading in the sun
it is lightweight and comfortable to read with
negetive : i find it has many glitches
from having trouble unlocking my screen , to having trouble getting the screen to even turn on so i can unlock it , to having my kindle application crash every time i get to the end of the book
i understand that it is probably an application issue with kindle , but having kindle compatibility was an absolute priority for me , as most of my library is on amazon
furthermore , my battery doesn not last at all
i have to power down my device every time i put it down , otherwise by the time i pick it up again to read , it is dead
won not even last a day
i have figured out that disconnecting it from wifi helps it last longer but not nearly enough
i was used to an ipad that lasted almost a week without charging
this battery time is unconvenient and unacceptable
those are the main glitches that impact my experience with this device
i don not recommend getting this tablet
i would like to purchase the kindle fire and give this away as a gift .
just want you to know that i did not get this tablet from amazon , got it from walmart but i must say that the tablet is great
i searched it on amazon but because it was near i went to walmart and bought one so as to ensure i would have it by
the nook tablet looks and works just fine , was a gift for my granddaughter .
i cant say enough good things about this tablet i love it
first off the screen is beautiful
its vivid and the colors are great
the best for the price no doubt
its even nicer than the nexus <NUM> screen
tablet performance is good for a dual core tabletand the gpu is a good one sgx540 same as some of the ipads so games run pretty well
weight ergonomics and screen size are just right
the quality of this tablet is excellent
it also has bluetooth which manny tablets don not have in this price range
personally i love the ui barnes and noble put on this table its nice
and now with google play you have a gazillion apps to choose from
battery life is also pretty good and wifi works well
the tablet has <NUM> speakers and there decent pretty loud which is nice
i got mine on sale for 100
00 is worth every penny
i guess the only minor thing i found was it gets a little warm at times but that is typical of manny tablets and phones .
my daughter bought these for her children through me
they love them
i would recommend them to everyone that likes this kind of stuff .
a year after barnes and noble dropped the price approximately one hundred dollars the nook hd+ 9" is still one of the best values in the tablet market
the price is starting to creep up for a new one so keep your eyes open for a sale , but don not wait too long because they are no longer being manufactured
there are two primary reasons that i like the nook hd+ 9"
first of course is the <NUM> x <NUM> high resolution display
you will note that by comparison 1080p is only <NUM> x <NUM> so this display is 4x3 not 16x9
in my opinion the extra pixels make browsing web pages more pleasant in both portrait and landscape mode
the second reason is that this tablet was sold in large numbers so developers have released rom builds with the latest version of android kitkat
these can be used either by flashing the tablet is rom internally or running kitkat from a micro sd card and leaving the nook is original operating system untouched
we have numerous android devices and were able to download everything we needed for free , but their are companies who sell micro sd cards already set up for around $20
so for a reasonable price one can get a "rooted" android tablet without doing much research and with almost no risk to the tablet or your warranty
this tablet was originally released in november of 2012
it has a 1
5 ghz omap4470 processor which is a little slower than the samsung exynos <NUM> 1
5ghz processor found in the galaxy tab <NUM> 8" that was released in a few months later in mid 2013
the processor is good enough to play most formats of hd video , but struggles with games with 3d graphics
it performs better with the rooted version of kitkat than with the stock nook os
we had a galaxy tab <NUM> 8" and now have a galaxy tab <NUM> 8"
they both have a very good gps and cameras in the front and rear
the nook has neither of these features
but the bigger display with 1920x1280 resolution as compared to 1280x800 on the galaxy tabs more than makes up for these shortcomings for most of what we use a tablet for
many of these were sold so there is a very good support network
lots of accessories are available through amazon and the other usual suspects
the hardware has proven to be dependable despite a few people who have reported problems here
they come with a good warranty and extended warranties are available
i am giving it <NUM> stars not because it is the greatest tablet ever made , but because at this time at the prices they are going for on sale
it is the best tablet value that i am currently aware of .
look folks this is not a $400 ipad or samsung
if you want a wizbang then you don not want the nook hd
for me it fit all my needs without needing a loan to buy one
i ordered my direct from b & n for $179
it came pre registered in my wifes account who has the nook color
it is very easy to create your own profile and not see all the junk your spouse has but , at the same time can pick what you want that they have
no need to repurchase what they already have
what barnes and nobel doesn not really want you to know is that you can put amazon is kindle app on the nook and read kindle books ( both free and purchased from amazon )
i also noted that , with the kindle app , you can adjust the fonts and resize pdf documents that you cannot do on the nook when reading pdf is
lets not forget its a <NUM> in screen
battery holds well at <NUM> hours
i bought a 32gb sd card and so far have put <NUM> movies ( and stiil room for many more ) on the card to watch in hd
i choose to save the memory on the nook for books or other apps and watch my movies from the tiny sd micro card
buy "dvd catalyst" ( really cool program for $9
95 ) ( can try it for free ) on line to compress those movies from dvd and then it automatically puts it on the micro card
i seen some gripes about them adding google store
not sure how you can complain about ading a whole another facet of apps
if you don not like it then don not add any google apps
its still a free country
so for reading ebooks , movies , games , apps and many others all for $179
00 , for me it hit my tickle spot
i gave it four stars instead of <NUM> because it did not have a camera , crappy speaker on the back instead of single or dual on the front
and the power cord is just too expensive for a crummy cable .
i have bought a few nooks over the years and have always loaded cyanogenmod ( plain android ) off an sd card ( and a few times on the actual device )
the hd+ is no exception
as long as you understand that it doesn not have a camera , its powerful and inexpensive
it even comes with google play ! east your hear out kindle users ! up for your own project ? head over to the xda developer forums and find out how to load a clean version of android either right on the device or run it off a microsd card
great screen , fast processor
this thing still has enough power to run the latest apps and android os !
well , i bought it because of the 1080p resolution
the screen quality is beautiful
i already have an apple 4th generation ipad , but i couldn not resist on the high quality picture and low price
after i received the nook , i immediately rooted with kit kat , the latest operating system
let me tell you , i am glad that i made the move
the original ice cream sandwich os has lag but not kit kat
with kit kat , not only the nook operates much more smoothly , you also get the full android tablet experience and more apps available from google play
i recently stumbled across the xbmc cine player android app in the google play store
with this app , i can now stream over <NUM> movies in hd quality for free
i have been using xbmc for a little while now on both macbook pro and raspberry pi , though the cine player version is library is not as extensive as the macbook pro and raspberry pi , it is good enough for use when you are on the road like in a hotel or something
with kit kat , i experience very little buffering issue
i can also output contents to a tv via the nook hdmi adapter
i believe you can output signal to a tv via google chromecast but i haven not tried it yet so i can not be for sure
i highly recommend the nook if you root it with the latest os
i am finding more and more things that i can do with the nook then the ipad due to android is an open system
by the way , i use n2a to root my two nook hd+ is
with a n2a micro sd card , it gives you the dual boot capabilities
you can use it to boot kit kat or the native barnes and noble os without removing the card
the n2a card doesn not replace the native os as the kit kat os is stored in the micro sd card so you don not have to be concerned about voiding the warranty from alternating the tablet os
bottom line , the nook hd+ is already a pretty decent tablet
one can greatly improve its potential with a simple change to the os
if front and back cameras and gps are not necessities for you , the nook is a good value tablet for 1/3 of the cost of an ipad
by the way , i bought an external bluetooth gps for $16 and it works like a charm with the nook
one can expect to spend $100 for an external bluetooth gps if your ios device doesn not come with an internal gps .
my husband had one and i got this one for christmas
it keeps all my books and crafting patterns in one place .
review for barnes & noble nook hd+a new winner in the "best value in a android tablet" category
when it was originally introduced at around $270 it was a decent value in a range tablet , but limited by the closed b&n ; ecosystem
now that it is being offered at new prices ( $ ) and has been upgraded to support google play android apps as well as b&n ; content , the value proposition is much improved
( yes , you will have to be patient and let your nook hd+ do a couple a major software updates before you can really settle down and enjoy your new toy ! but it is worth the wait
) if you are coming from other nook devices , you will feel right at home
if not , you may be surprised to find the combined "reader" and "android tablet" interface pretty nice
it is well thought out and for the most part works very well
take your time and be willing to explore a bit and you will soon get the hang if it
don not miss the "nook today" icon which is a clever one , but easily overlooked
all in all , i was very comfortable with it in a short time and actually find the ui a bit of a refreshing change
( occasionally , you have to use the home key instead of just "back" but a minor quibble
) [note : you can "override" the nook ui and install other "launchers" but i , personally , felt no need to do so
but nice to know the option is there if ever needed
]the size is a nice compromise between the smaller units ( too small for comfortable long video watching ) and the larger units ( big , heavy , bulky )
the " range seems to be the sweet spot
the full hd ( 1920x1080 256ppi ) screen is gorgeous with great colors and contrast and sufficient brightness
videos/movies , youtube , photos , graphics , all look great
the high quality screen is the big draw here , in my opinion
excellent value at the new price point
the size , weight ( very light for this size device ) , slimness , and easy handling are all good points of this tablet
some do not like the nook hole on the bottom left , but i am fine with it
it gives a bit of orientation , an easy place to grab the tablet , and so on
the styling looks good to me and the slimness is nice and makes it easy to hold and handle
hd youtube and netflix look wonderful
this is absolutely one of the best tablets for the price if you want to watch netflix on the go
i was able to hook up my portable bluetooth speakers without any problems , so the movies sounded great as well
bluetooth headphones also worked well as did regular headphones , of course
the built in speaker ( s ) is ok , but not sufficient for best music and movie sound quality ( as is true with most tablets )
the controls are well placed , simple , and easy to use
the microsd card slot is a nice bonus so you can expand your storage easily and is a feature missing from many tablets
the proprietary charging port is a minus , a standard usb would have been more flexible , but it works well and charges faster
the handy "home" button with the nook logo is very useful and also works well
there are no cameras - and i could care less , but some might
i will take the superb screen , great design and build , and other nice features and be happy
for the techies , it uses 1
5 ghz omap <NUM> proc and <NUM> gb of ram
not cutting edge , but plenty fast
benchmarks i checked were all pretty good and the nook hd+ is very responsive in use
the back features a nice "soft touch" feel that i really like versus many tablets that have a slick back making them prone to being easily dropped
the recent update adds the chrome browser to the nook hd+ and web browsing is snappy and works well
everything looks great , of course , on the full hd screen and the chrome browser handles most web pages with aplomb , formatting them nicely for the nook hd+
chrome will also sync and update your bookmarks and such across devices , automatically , which is nice
if you like barnes & noble and their books and movie content , then , of course , that is a win for you as well
it is all here and well integrated
plus there are some nook hd+ specific apps and you should prefer them in most cases
( note : i made the mistake of updating the nook netflix app with the one from the google play store -- big ! it did not work at all
once i uninstalled it and went back and reloaded the version from the nook store ( free ) -- everything worked fine again
i have had this issue with other tablets as well , the netflix app seems to be very picky and you need the right one for your specific tablet
i had also installed the android pandora over the nook version , but that one worked fine
if you do this and have issues , just uninstall and reinstall from nook store/cloud vs
google play store and you will be fine
) all of the other android apps from google play that i tried have worked fine
pandora , stitcher internet radio , maps , amazon mp3 , amazon kindle ( wow ! a bit of a surprise ! ) , gmail , youtube , etc
all work as expected
the new openness of the nook hd+ is a game changer for the nook line , and pushes it way up in the rankings in my opinion
i bought mine at the local b&n ; store and there is a lot of help available there if you need it , which is a huge bonus if you are tech challenged and need advice and help locally
very friendly staff and great customer service , what a novel concept ! ; ) the nook hd+ is a "sleeper" - an often overlooked alternative to other more expensive tablets that can both out perform them and well beat them in value , being available currently at very attractive prices
a <NUM> star item for features , design , performance , and value .
i bought this tablet for someone as a gift
i was so confused about which one i should get them
i definitely chose correctly for them .
i cannot believe the seller who sold me this not good , great nook hd+ , that is keeping me very happy
i have been truly blessed , this nook tablet is the best
i am watching movies on it via hulu and netflix and other apps for movies etc
the video and audio are great for me either outside on my porch or indoors
i do not plan to do much more other than playing a game here and there , this tablet is sufficient to my needs
there is no camera , if you need one get another type of tablet
i recommend for those who do not need a super tablet , however , this tablet can do a lot
i just have not tried it all yet
i will again say this , the video playback to me is awesome , it is truly hd
i am very satisfied with my refurbished nook hd+ , ii am getting a lot for very little
i recommend buying thnook for a few dollars worth a lot of fun .
i bought this nook hd+ in the summer for $179 from bestbuy
it seemed like the best value at the time for a 32gb tablet
i thought that it would be good for our trip to spain
we ended up using it to watch a few movies on the plane and that was it
fast forward a few months of neglecting using the nook and the device will not even turn on
i keep thinking that i am doing something wrong , but the next step is most likely going to be a trip to bestbuy after i confirm that i ordered the extended warranty ( it is been a busy time for us ! )
so needless to say i am not impressed
update : well , the nook decided to power on again when i followed the instructions to turn on a "dead nook"
i don not have the instructions right here , but if you find them ( has to do with pressing and holding two of the buttons at the same time ) , make sure to look at your screen very carefully because one of the options is to restore your nook to factory settings - and you won not want to do that if you have anything stored on it
i will just have to see how it goes
wish amazon instant video would play on it , but redbox now offers an $8 monthly subscription rate for <NUM> dvds at the kiosk and unlimited streaming
that along with netflix give me two options for streaming video .
having all the ipad models , <NUM> different android models , i can say this tablet overall is a bit disappointing
i realize for those that have come from old hardware or new to tablets might believe this is a bit harsh , but keep in mind this is more of a comparison to other options available out there
granted there are price differences and for price alone , this is a decent deal
the hardware itself is impressive
bought these for our <NUM> and <NUM> years which were upgrading from their galaxy <NUM> 7" tablets
the most significant issue with these tablets is the b&n ; version of an already outdated android os_ice cream sandwich , not the latest jelly bean which is far far better
it is very clunky and very slow , not at all snappy by any sense , even with the latest updates
i did buy it as they finally put play on it which was a requirement for me , but the os itself is just horrible
it does have a kids profile mods which is very handy as it allows you to limit what your kids can open
additionally , as this is an 'overlay' os , it is very limited in terms of options
sound options are none existent for various task such as switching profiles , etc
many apps on the google store will indicate not compatible with this device
i generally rom my android devices however cm10 is the only one at this time with any support and that rom is very very buggy compared to say frosty rom which is not available for this tablet
it works , but again , not a smooth integration of a rom
so really , your stuck with what b&n ; puts on it and at this time , it is very slow and clunky
now you can 'buy' a card with jelly bean on it , but again , pulling off the card is slower vs
internal memory , though it does allow for a very simple method of getting a areal' android os on this tablet and perhaps the best route at this time
for the kids , they still like the tablet , enjoy the better graphics , larger screen , etc
once going graphics is good , sound is adequate though not great , touch input is good
but for me , i could never use this tablet for serious use
my asus tf700t is my go to tablet , even over my ipad 4 , 3 , 2 , etc
at this time i am contemplating just selling these and buy nexus tablets for the kids instead as it is more a pure android experience and not hindered by the clunky implementation of an older android os
perhaps if b&n ; releases an os based on jelly bean it may improve things
bottom line , there are far better options in the android world
prosgood resolutiontouch is goodgreat balance of size , not large nor small like a 7" tablethas play installedexternal memory card optionconsb&n ; os is horrible , slow , cluncky , and based on old ice cream sandwich , not jelly beanspeakers are just okvery limited accessory options compared to even kindle hd devicescharger plug is very tight on both of my models
perhaps it will loosen up over time
never had a tablet exhibit this in the past
lack of support from the aftermarket in terns of rom availability
no cameraold slow hardware , and you will notice this
download speeds compared to my other tablets is very slow .
this is good product compared to its price
i am using it for watching video , writing documents , and web searching
it is perfect for my needs , and i upload cm 1
0 , so now i am using it with android
it is so good
: - )
brand new condition
fast shipping
this tablet is the best deal on a 9&<HASHTAG> ; size that you can get
way better than what the same size cost in my last husband
easy to use , lots of storage for apps even the large ones
plus will hold additional scancard
beats the kindle ( sorry amazon ) by a mile in functionality , weight and price .
got this for my nook ( since b&n didn not have it ! ) good price and exactly what i needed
it also seems to be a better made product than the one that came with my color nook .
bought this to replace the broken micro usb cable on my old charger for my nook tablet
wished i could just get the cable as the ac plug works fine
after <NUM> weeks the micro usb end of the cable broke again
this is the 3rd barnes and noble cable i have gone through and will not be purchasing another from them again
any plain micro usb cable will charge the nook tablet , so save some money and get a cheaper unbranded cable instead .
i had the original adapter that came with my nook color for <NUM> years without any problems
after <NUM> years it finally broke , and i didn not even know people were having troubles with their chargers until i had to buy a new one
i have had this one for at least a couple weeks now and again i don not seem to be having any problems with it
the original charger that did finally break was because of the area where it plugs into the system though , which is where everyone is having problems
so i will not deny that this seems to be an issue
for that it loses a star , but because i personally haven not had any major problems with them i will still give it <NUM> stars .
the original chargers i had for the nooks were dying , as in literally falling apart after a couple years
hopefully these replacement chargers will last just as long , if not longer .
this is the third adapter that i have tried other than buying direct from b&n
this adapter is quality made and works excellent with the device
it is better made than the original
great value .
works as described
owned <NUM> years now and works well
no complaints here
great product at an excellent price
since it is a cable for digital data
shielding isn not a big issue with hdmi
use it for my satellite boxes for 1080i hd plus audio
no problems .
only had it for a few weeks but have not noticed one problem for this price compared to other hdmi cables i feel like i won big on this item .
it is not top of the line by any means , but certainly a good value for the price .
i bought this cable to hook up an apple tv
save your money on the expensive cable and buy this one
works great !
this item does exactly what it says it will do - and at a good price
if i had a complaint , it was that i did not purchase a longer one for what i need it for
of course , this is more of my fault versus the product
but , if the length works for you , and you need a hdmi cable , this will fill the job and do it very well .
wire is heavy grade , but as with all cables you can not really tell how strong the connectors are till they break .
item was as described in post
simple and just what i needed
great price too
actually bought two
good value
with amazon prime , these things are only $4 ! they arrived so quickly , just in time for me to hookup my computer and other entertainment systems into my new tv
they are fantastic !
this cable works as advertised
no need to spend more for an hdmi cable
there is no difference in picture quality between this cable and brands costing much , much more .
they are inexpensive and they get the job done
i am glad i got them
i use them with my wdtv at work
love 'em and if i lose them i will just buy another set or 2 .
gold is good
makes the best quality connections for data trans
length is more than adequate ( 6ft ) , as length can attenuate ( diminish ) the quality of signals
also , sheathing to reduce/illuminate or interference both in and out of the cable
used to connect bluray player ( ) to <NUM> inch plasma tv w/o a hitch
amazon cables are just as good
i think they all come from china
the thickness of the wire and the gold plate are both factors in quality data links
like the size of a hose for water , and how much pressure it will endure
with free shipping you can not go wrong , and they are guaranteed
it took about three weeks for delivery .
i don not have too much exciting to say about the cable
i am not a videophile by any means , but the cable works , i don not see any problems with it , and it is a bunch cheaper than i could get from best buy .
a cable is a cable
it is going to work <PERCENT> of the time no matter where you buy it
but amazon always has the best prices !
this cable works fantastic and i didnt have to pay $60 for it
i highly recommend ! so glad i gave a cheap price hdmi a shot .
the price was right and i cannot discern a difference between this cable and a higher priced cable i have in my possession
maybe i will see a difference when i upgrade to 4k products .
bought this to replace a $13 , <NUM> foot cable bought from target which would cause picture glitches and dropouts regularly - this one works flawlessly , is twice as long and a fraction of the price !
purchased this a few years ago and forgot to write a review
needless to say i am still using it and have no problems
i purchased this back when the cheapest hdmi cord was $30
great buy , i recommend it .
much cheaper than buying in a local store , about one fourth the price
after actually using it , i realize that having a longer one would make some tasks i need it for much easier .
brought back my ipod video 30g back life , easy to replace
only hard part is to get the case opened .
awesome replacement for an ipod video 5th gen 30gb hard drive , saved me the cost of buying a brand new ipod .
this article with all my expectations fulfilled recommend it because the packaging and jurisdiction entrag correct , in addition to run ferfecion
a very easy replacement for a 5th gen ipod 30g hd
i purchased the ipod on ebay knowing it was damaged
it had the "sad ipod face" screen of death
i could hear the hd trying to spin up , but not reading properly
if you have that indication , all you need is this hd ! the repair was easy
carefully pry apart the ipod with a small flat screwdriver and remove the smaller connector
the ipod can now be placed on a table with both pieces open
next , remove the bad hd by unplugging the ribbon cable on the hd side
make sure to note the orientation of the hd as it will only work one way
easy to put the replacement hd in "backwards"
replace with the new hd
the only trouble i had was the cable would not stay in the hd for some reason
i had to use a piece of tape to secure the cable to the hd so it wouldn not come out
next , using a small pair of pliers , grip the small ribbon cable gently , and push it back into it is slot
finally , carefully hold the hd in place and the two ipod pieces
now you will have to restore to factory settings
there are resources on the net for this
i just started up itunes and plugged in the ipod
after a few min
itunes reconized that the ipod needed to be restored
good luck !
my ipod video had hard drive failure
i used ifixit instructions and this drive to make it work
make sure you plug the cable in the right way
drive is shielded on both sides unlike the original so you have to look carefully
if you get it wrong , ipod will tell you there is battery failure , but there isn not , it is just the drive in backwards
i flipped it around and it worked , no harm done .
not much to say
dropped right into my zune in place of the original drive
the cable release tab is extremely fragile , but the drive works just fine even though i broke the tab
oops !
my daughter is 30gb ipod classic needed a new hard drive and this worked great
about <NUM> minutes to install , plug in to itunes and it set up by itself .
works great , but wasn not what i expected
thanks sent it back
maybe it will be good for a conferance room , but not for singing too record .
i love this little speaker/microphone
the sounds is very clear
volume buttons work great , and the microphone is great ! i love this item !
i use it on microsoft lynch for telecoms
the speaker is a little &<HASHTAG> ; tinny&<HASHTAG> ; but the mic works well without echoing .
i love this produtct
echo canceling is working perfectry
it is avairable for room meeting
5mm headphone jack
i bought it totaly more than 10 , and i will buy more for my friends .
i got this for my computer to use with my magic jack and i got no sound or nothing
it may not be compatible with magic jack but more like skype
since i don not have skype , there is no way of knowing if it would work with skype or compatible with it .
we were very happy with this purchase at first , but some of the buttons have stopped working after using it a few times a week for a couple months
the volume buttons no longer work and the volume can not be adjusted on the laptop , so we have to suffer through a blasting speaker in order to gain the benefits of the microphone , which also seems as if it may be starting to have intermittent problems .
this film is definitely not for anyone who is especially fond of the independent , delightfully manipulative and clever boy who was the brain child of samuel clemens is classic
as one example , the book has great fun with the scenes involving aunt polly , a simple minded soul who thinks herself quite clever , and the genuinely shrewd tom , who plays on catering to polly is illusions about her own wit
this is a far cry from beautiful , intelligent celeste holm is portrayal of polly - and the family is poverty , clearly seen in the book , disappears , as the sawyers occupy a beautiful home and are close friends with wealthy widow douglas
some of the plot is distorted in ways that remove the charm of the original
tom is taking off to &quot ; play pirates&quot ; after becky jilts him is changed into a troubled kid is escape after aunt polly tells him how &quot ; no good&quot ; his father was - the humour , and the engaging portrayal of adolescent &quot ; first love&quot ; is gone
the theme of tom is learning responsibility is overworked , and sequences that are hilarious in the book ( sunday school , classroom , etc ) are largely left out
the enchanting becky thatcher is reduced to a tomboy
and isn not much of the picnic sequence ruined when a gathering of kids is changed to a outing for families ? ( tom sawyer is quite realistic in its setting forth that kids are far more concerned with themselves than fretting about parents - let is not turn it into a commentary on &quot ; family values&quot ; a la 1990s political correctness
) johnny whitaker is singing voice has all the appeal of chalk squeaking on a blackboard
his rendition of &quot ; if i were god&quot ; ( aside from its text having nothing to do with the story - tom is only church interests are in time to play with his pinch bug ) is pure purgatory for the listener .
i hadn not heard of this <NUM> movie version of the classic mark twain story until recently , but i absolutely had to see it
after all , it had music by the sherman brothers ( best known for their work in mary poppins )
and i love a good musical
the book stays very true to the novel
tom sawyer ( johnny whitaker ) is a young boy growing up in 1840 is hannibal , missouri
an orphan , he is being raised by his aunt polly ( celeste holm )
and he is quite the handful
he regularly plays hooky to fish and swim with best pal huckleberry finn ( jeff east )
he constantly lies to get out of trouble , too
through this movie , we watch as tom struggles with his conscience after witnessing a murder in the cemetery
he tricks the boys in town to white washing the fence for him
and he develops a crush on new girl becky thatcher ( a young jodie foster )
but will injun joe ( kunu hank ) get his sworn revenge on the boy ? this movie is extremely faithful to the book , hitting all the highlights of the classic
frankly , that was a problem for me since it took a little while to get going
once i got into the story , i was hooked and really began to enjoy the tale
the scenery and costumes recreate the times well
and the acting was pretty good
unfortunately , i found the songs disappointing
they weren not bad , but they weren not good either
they aren not especially memorable or singable , and they don not really advance the story
i would rather rewatch this movie for the characters and adventures then the songs
despite that rather major flaw for a musical , i must admit to enjoying it
it has a sweetness and innocence that i enjoyed
and the songs are easy to overlook since they aren not a major part of the movie
so if you are looking for a fun version of the classic tale , you can do much worse than this one .
the advertisment for this dvd on amazon was incorrect
the ad stated that the dvd was in wide screen anamorphic format
the dvd was not in this format , it was standard pan and scan , and it was a poor quality transfer from the film
i thought about returning it , but decided to give it as a gift
motion pictures that are filmed in anamorphic , or 2
35 to <NUM> format should only be transfered to a dvd in this format
the people that make the decision to use pan and scan to fill a standard television are ill advised , and poorly educated to artistic principles .
i would love to buy this movie as i have been to hannibal missouri and been to all the mark twain atractions
to buy this movie would be a real treat but if it is pan&scan forget it ! i dont buy full screen movies ! unless it is made for tv
i think mgm should of included a widescreen version of the movie
what a joke !
this movie was playing at radio city music hall back in the days of the movie/stage show formt
it was also presented in 70mm on that huge radio city screen
i remember how impressed i was with that opening scene with the steam boat going down the river and you see tom running thru the field and the music builds more and more
wow , what a great movie ! i have seen many versions of &quot ; tom sawyer&quot ; but this one seems to be the best ever brought to the screen
maybe because it is a musical
whatever made this so successful back then you will not be disappointed by it is gradure and scope
a must for ever american kid and adult too
this is as red , white and blue as it gets and now must be the most politically incorrect movie ever made
( hehe ) buy it before some group puts a ban on it
which should want you to buy this for the kids even more
they don not make them like this anymore .
this is a and musical version of the tom sawyer story
it does not follow the book exactly , but the substance is there
charming performances by then child actors johnny whitaker ( tom ) and jodie foster ( becky thatcher ) and celeste holm as aunt polly
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie
i rented it for my granddaughter is school project and wound up watching it <NUM> times
it took me back to my childhood of playing with the children next door in a more neighborly world
highly recommended .
this fits my 7" kindle fire hd perfectly ! i love it
it even has a slot for a stylus
the kindle is velcroed in so it is nice and secure
very glad i bought this !
good case , while not new to kindle books i am new to kindles , the fire hd is my first one
i wanted some protection for it as well as something to hold it for me , i often read in bed and with this it stands up some
i wish it were more adjustable
the reality is the way i use it you have two choices , flat , or slightly inclined
the way the pictures show in the upper right it looks like it will stand almost upright , that is not practical for my purposes
i am not sure a case is made that would fit my desires , this is very nice although i felt overpriced .
not the best leather but worked fine and keeps my kindle safe and protected
it should have come with a stylus .
case fits well on my kindle , serves the purpose and for the price , you can not beat it
definitely a keeper .
i got this got a new kindle fire hd owner who loves yellow
the case is nice for price , it does what it has to do but the smell at first is very unpleasant
i am glad it arrived fast and i had time to leave it out of plastic for a few days to air out till smell went away .
i love this case fits my kindle perfectly the only thing i dont like is that the power button is not visable in the case other than a great case
it is her favorite color and it protects her kindle
she has no complaints
covers the power button , but not a big deal .
the only downside to this was the cover covers up the on off button and the camera and i have to take it out of the cover to use the camera if i had known this i would have chosen a different one
i bought this at the same time i bought the kindel fire hd 7
it is exactly as pictured , the fit was great , and the price was right
the reason for the <NUM> stars is the cut outs for the volume and power buttons are on the edges of case but the actual buttons are located on the back of the kindel
you can not access either button while the case is on
apparently when kindel upgrades a tablet they don not change the name or add a number to it like apple does with the ipad
i went back and searched for clues in the description that this was for a different version kindel and did not find anything
if you want a decent case and you don not want to pay a lot for it , this is the one but just make sure it is designed for the hd <NUM> kindel version you are buying .
great case , not sure how the hand stripe works and wish it had vertical stand but for the price it is the best case i ever had
very soft and smooth on the inside
color is the best .
well it is nice , i just bought the wrong one , any ways it fits my tablet
and i am still using it .
i just received this today ! i love it
i have one similar for my kindle fire hd and i love the sleep and awake feature !
great case , especially for the price point
my daughters favorite color so she loves it too
bought the matching stylus .
worked great for what i needed it for , and was small too
i bought <NUM> of these for my test equipment - they got the job done
though the screw on one of these did snap under medium torque
the other <NUM> adaptors were fine under the same torque
however , on a different one of these adaptors , i had to &<HASHTAG> ; open up&<HASHTAG> ; one of the pin holes slightly before it would accept my male cable
i would probably buy again .
very compact and no problems with baud rates up to 115k
couldn not be happier with this adapter
i highly recommend keeping this and the various related adapters to anyone who needs to interface with network equipment .
this works as a null modem cable , just as advertised
this low profile connector is working perfect in combination with my usb cable .
nice construction and nice labeling so you don not use it for the wrong thing
it does the job and for only three bucks , you can not go wrong .
it is not very often that i can get something cheap , fast , and that performs as it should
this is one such item
the hardware seems to be durable , it is very compact , and it performs the simple null modem task .
bought this to transfer video from some old equipment
( sony hi8 videocam and panasonic omnivision vhs cassette player
) it is not fancy but does the job
i prefer to use potplayer to capture/convert the video over the included software which works ok
i am satisfied with this purchase .
i have been using this alot , converting old video tapes , vhs , and tv into online videos
anything you can play on your vcr , from tapes or tv , it can record .
the ezgrabber2 works well but it is software is a little lack luster
i have software installed on my computer that works properly with my night vision so the ezgrabber works well to do what i needed .
i bought it to create dvds from home vhs video
had to upgrade my pc to a faster cpu to avoid jittery recording
after that it work as described
delivery was fast .
i got this because it was pretty decently priced , honestly though seeing how some of the other video capture devices out there were upwards of $60 i wasn not expecting much
when i got , i was rather surprised how well it worked
while it is plug 'n play , i decided to forgo the install cd and just downloaded the drivers directly from the manufacturer is website
while the video is decent quality , it still retains some grainyness after burning the video to a dvd , the quality of the original played on a vcr is still better quality than what you capture and burn to a dvd
that being said , it is not all that bad , really
but since i only needed to copy a few home videos that we made from an old camcorder it wasn not really worth it
i found that the best way to get the best quality was to adjust the video settings manually ( add a little more saturation , and sharpness ) , and use the "dvd" format for capture , that were there is minimal second encoding required when you burn to a disc ( i use windows dvd maker , because i am cheap : b ) the nice thing is it also includes an option , unfortunately my vcr only allows with 480p signals ( ie dvd movies and restricts vcr video to 480i
the dvd capture format seems to add some deinterlacing to the captured video from what i can tell ( though it might just be my video card doing it ) still , it is a pretty good buy for someone who wants to archive or even send family members burned dvds of videos .
a little background
i am a <NUM> year old man who has played around with electronics and computers my entire life
windows machine with 8gb ram blah , blah , blah
i have struggled well over a month with this piece of trash
after this experience i am done with micro$oft is depending on consumers to fix there crap os and heading to costco to let other computers do what this device clearly will not .
i have used this cover with both a kindle ( generation 2 ) and a nook
surprisingly , this case is better designed for a nook for two reasons : >the sleep/power button location
on the nook , the button is on the top center so none of the four corner holds block any button or access port
however , on the kindle the button - which requires a slide , not a press - is towards the left of the device top and is covered slightly by the top left corner hold
this isn not a deal breaker for me , but i was very surprised at it because its being marketed for the kindle ! so when i want to wake up my kindle i have to move the corner hold , slide the switch , and then readjust the corner hold
not easy to do because the hold has a lot of ( good ) tension
>5 way directional key
the notebooks that are included with this case slide into the case from the top and still have room to move both left and right
because of the lining of the case and the thin cover of the notebook , it slides easily but i have never had it come out
i have however had it slide far right inside the cover , and then when i shut the cover it is at such a position that it hits the <NUM> way directional key and starts to advance chapters ! i thought it was just a fluke at first , but then it kept happening
if i do not adjust the position of the notebook or force the kindle into sleep then the notebook hits the key every time now
the nook lacks this <NUM> way directional key entirely , so again - no issues there
( this issue might also be contributed to the "breaking in" of the case so that the spine is not rigid anymore and allows the front to move at angles
i don not believe i have been rough with the case though , so i can only assume its common wear )
i also want to through my hat into the ring in regards to the less than compact design - though in truth i don not think it could have been any slimmer without causing negative pressure to the devices when closed .
at the time i bought this cover the kindle had just come out
( 1st generation ) it served its purpose , but since then there have been so many new cover in types and styles .
aw , come on , moleskine -- you make a terrific kindle cover to hold a notepad ( moleskine notepad , even ) --- and then no pen loop ? what kind of silliness is this ? love it in every way except that darned lack of a pen loop - clipping a pen to it is not the same and i don not want to dent up the cover
wish it came in more colors , like moleskine red and the other volant shades -- and that one could get the reporter notebooks in colors , too
but this doesn not mean i am not happy with this !
overall : good kindle case , especially for moleskine users
i use it and am happy with it
pros : - looks and feels like a moleskine- looks enough like a book or journal to disguise the kindle- looks nice on the inside and outside- having a pad next to a kindle is very good- includes two while moleskinescons : - no place to store a writing utensil- won not fit standard moleskine reporter books , even the soft cover ones ( too rigid backing , too thick ) - a lined journal would have been better- feels like it needs another slit at the base to keep the journal from getting loose- hard to get the elastic straps for the kindle to look right
as a longtime moleskine user , i was very excited when i learned they made a kindle case
i have not been disapointed
it is a sturdy case that looks great and performs well
it is the first kindle case i have owned that seems to be a "permanent living space" for my kindle , if you know what i mean
a few reviewers seem to not like it because the notepad is on the left , while the kindle is on the right
i can understand their reasoning , but i actually prefer it the way it is - and i am
if the kindle were on the left , with the notepad on the right , it would be more awkward to hold
for the few notes i take on paper , it is really no big deal to reach over the screen to do so
that said , moleskine ought to offer both a "left" and "right" handed version if the case
i would think it'd be easy to simply flip the design
then people could choose which version they wanted .
i purchased this because i was basically afraid to take my kindle anywhere without the case , and i love moleskine notebooks
the surface of the cover is soft
not like a normal moleskine notebook
the top left elastic strap does ( minorly ) interfere with the operation of the on switch
it doesn not really bother me all that much though
i have had mine for a week or two now , and it still has a chemical smell to it
be prepared to let it air out for a while .
i have been waiting a while for this cover , and it is everything i thought it would be : moleskine quality , substantial feel , nice holder for the ipad , and a replaceable pad
the only thing missing is a pen loop
other vitals you may want to know : -- it is 1
375 inches in thickness with ipad loaded ( that is almost an inch and a half ) -- the cover doesn not appear to be leather , even though it appears to be leather
just like the notebooks
-- interior is microsuede-- ipad is very secure in there
-- spine is rounded , not square-- you can fold back the entire thing so it is flat
-- not able to prop this thing up to view from afar ( too slippery ) , and no prop is included
-- all buttons , ports , and speakers are accessible
-- looks good , feels good
all that said , moleskine made a mistake with their design
while they include directions on how to flip the unit around to use it for leftys , when you do so , the "cover" becomes the back , and vice versa
and on your new cover , you now have an embossed moleskine logo--upside down ! it is bad enough they didn not bother with a lefty unit , but i can handle flipping it around ( and having my ipad home button on top )
and i can handle that once flipped the strap works the opposite of all other moleskine products ( since back is now front )
but to have moleskine expect me to start at their upside down logo all day is more than i am willing to settle for on such a pricey item
i am angry that i waited for so long for a product with such a silly flaw
i hope they fix this , but considering how long it took them to produce the case , and how late it is coming to market even after it was announced , i don not think that they will
too bad
could have been a great product .
i am starting my review over and changing this from <NUM> stars ( i like it ) to <NUM> stars ( i don not like it )
at first i praised it highly based upon initial expectations
, but now that i actually used it for work i am seeing it may not be the case for me
i have tried a number of cases for the ipad from a travel case to the marware to the otterbox
i always wanted one with a notepad built in and was excited to see the moleskine ipad case
i placed my order on nov
7th and after nearly <NUM> weeks it finally arrived
initial reactions , i like the case
it was thick and felt pretty solid
i liked the way the case held the ipad and overall the case seemed really well built
now , i don not have any issues with the build quality
the case is built very well
and others have complained about the thickness , well i expected it to be a little thick since it now has a notebook with it
my measurement , it is just at the 1" mark in terms of thickness
what did i like : -construction quality , very nicely made
-ipad protection , the ipad is held very securely in the case , big plus
-love that it has a notebook , unfortunately it is not a standard size which makes this a minus as well
-looks professional
this is one of the best looking cases i have seen
my issue comes into the issues i found while using the case
first off , the volume and mute switch are on the inside of the case
this means you need to fold open the case if you need to mute or turn the sound down on your ipad
it is a minor inconvenience , but if i am in a meeting and my calendar app starts shooting alerts it is nice to be able to flip the switch quickly then go through opening the notebook up and having to mute it
now in most meetings i am actively taking notes but in other meetings i am just a observer so when i am not taking notes this issue causes more of a distraction
second , replacement notebooks
i have been searching high and low for replacement notebooks and cannot find any
i found some small jr
legal pads and tried those and yes they work , but they don not sit as securely in the sleeve like the moleskine brand pad is and i think this could cause to ripping or sagging of the fabric
i think you are going to need moleskine brand pads or risk ruining the fabric sleeve
this is just a guess
and since you can not at the current time buy replacement notebooks you are out of luck once you run through the initial <NUM> pages
third , no pen loop
they give you a notebook and a spot for your ipad , but nowhere to hook a pen
yes i can carry a pen in my pocket , but you would think for the cost there would be a small loop to hold a pen or ipad stylus like the pogosketch
fourth , the true of the case
the case can in fact be used by left handed people , but that causes a few issues
first off the back becomes the cover and now you have an upside down moleskine logo , plus the band is attached to the back so the sleek look is gone
then my biggest complaint , the ipad is upside down when used in left handed mode so the home button is at the top
this also means the microphone is opposite the home button
so when the home button is at the top the microphone is pointed towards you
i use an app to record audio from meetings and take notes and when the ipad is faced the right direction this works flawlessly
when i use the moleskine case in left handed mode the microphone faces me and in turn the audio is hard to hear as it is pointed away from the conversations
fifth , no stand
it would be nice if you could somehow stand the ipad up but this case is really just meant to be used flat on it is back
it is not sold as a case with a stand , but come on , for topping the $60 mark you would think it would have one
all in all , it is nice to finally have a case , built well with a notepad
but given the lack of replacement notebooks readily for sale for this case and no pen loop to carry a writing instrument makes it weak
i can use the case in right handed mode , but they sell it as left handed compatible and it really isn not as functional as it should be
they instead should release a second model that is built for left handed and not make one unit
i may end up returning this case and going back to my marware
i am going to keep using it until the end of this week before deciding
--update 12/9/2010--i have returned the case back to amazon and have gone back to themarware for ipad
this out of all the cases i have use is the best for my personal situation
i wanted to like the moleskine case but it just didn not work for me and i still can not find replacement notepads
sorry moleskine , perhaps revision <NUM> will be the one for me , but so far your case didn not meet my expectations .
i have read many reviews on folio cases for ipad
you will find "the best ever" in most of reviews that have got over four stars
so , i won not say the cliche , but want to say that i am very satisfied
although i love my ipad , i'd felt sad as a fountain pen collector that my fountain pens are no longer useful
then , i bumped into this case
what a wonderful idea to put moleskine with ipad ! someone said in the previous review that it is a inch thick , and it is true
i feel like i am holding a book
however , it makes me feel that my ipad is well protected
the quality of paper is good as always , and it is very easy to flip over
also , it also has the rubber band ! since i don not have keen eyes to see whether it is real leather or not , but the skin feels smooth and soft .
this product appeared to be high quality and well made
it also has the feature that turns on the ipad when the cover is opened
the moleskin does have a very nice , luxurious feel
for me , it was just too heavy
not in pounds , but when you hold an ipad up for a few hours , a few ounces can make a big difference
there is another ipad cover sold on amazon that is a big seller , at around $20+ , made of a synthetic material
it is much lighter , and also turns on when opened
i hate to pass on higher quality and probably longer lasting , but this moleskin cover was just too tiring for me .
i have owned this for a month , hoping to use it in meeting situations where ipad typing and other forms of note taking doesn not quite get it
i was stunned to learn the tablets are not available with lines
quite an oversight as they are overpriced to begin with
the cover holds the ipad in a fairly but not definitely snug manner
it is designed primarily for left handers with the plug and button holes oriented for the ipad to be placed upside down if the writing tablet is on the right side
no big deal for a right handed person
a note to moleskin asking about future lined tablets was responded to with a trite "go "
a better product is bound to be offered soon from a more customer friendly , less smug company .
i have ( had ) one of these , different vendor , came w/ a <NUM> yr warranty
died at <NUM> yr <NUM> months
i was unable to find anyone who repairs monitors like this , too
great while it lasted , but reliability is unclear ( search on yamaksasi monitor failure and you will see a lot of them die at just over ~1 yr
i suspect a blown cap in the inverter from the symptoms )
also runs unusually hot at full brightness ( both the screen and the power brick get quite hot )
to be fair , it is a heck of a steal otherwise , and the image quality and speed are terrific ( you must have a input , not just or any other format like dp or hdmi or vga ; has a full rectangle of pins on the plug , not two groups of pins
search on dvi connector and you will see lots of illustrations of the types if you are unsure )
great for spreadsheets , gaming , etc
it died prematurely .
i am a gamer and a coder
this monitor is great for both
although i would like it a bit more with hdmi , it performs beautifully from my gtx <NUM> 4gb .
the monitor has only brightness and power controls
there are five other unmarked buttons that do nothing observable
there is only one dvi plug
the included cable worked fine for me
i am running the monitor on rhel 6
the monitor periodically ( once a week ) would forget how to transmit its edid on reset from standby
i ended up downloading the edid from the monitor and setting up my xorg
conf to load from file rather than from the monitor
no more issues
i am using the monitor in a sitting beside and hp 30&<HASHTAG> ; supplied by work
the height on the hp is adjustable to exactly match the yamakasi .
since the resolution is great at 2560*1600 you can view magazine like hbr or scientific america in dual page with crystal clear , flicker free
you need a proper placement on table since it cannot raise monitor up like my previous dell <NUM> inch
the brightness and ips performance so stunning
for thailand friend , they send direct to your home and pay custom for <NUM> b
then this monitor is much cheaper than any <NUM> inch with same resolution selling in thailand
poonchaibangkok , thailand
much better than the 1440p qnix and destroys all 1080p
this puts all the 120/144 hz stuff to bed
unless you play *seriously* competitively ( and you probably do not ) , then 1600p ips absolutely destroys <NUM> monitors with much higher refresh rates
those are ok monitors and just fine , but if you have the horsepower ( r9 <NUM> or 290x , <NUM> or 780ti can definitely max this baby , other slightly lower cards still work very well , as well as crossfire and sli ) , get this
no dead pixels , gorgeous screen , and a really good stand
straight monitor with no bs features
it turns on
it is a boss
it turns off .
[[edit]]now that i have upgraded my graphics card to a 2gb ddr5 card with a port on it , the monitor gives me the full 1080p for movies and general resolution of 2560x1600
this was the problem
if you have a standard "on board/integrated" graphics card , then this monitor might not work for you
you may not have a port and it may not be able to support this hulk
on a different retail site , this company is recommendation was to have a minimum 1gb on your graphics card , and upgraded to a 2gb that is working quite well
i am not a movie junkie but the colors look good to me
i have no complaints about the display
the monitor does run hot though , which i think is typical for this style
original review below , unedited : it came with no english manual , and no dvds for drivers
windows is running mine with the generic driver
the best resolution i can get is 1280x800 , which looks horrific
i am aware that the problem *might* be my graphics card , but this card is definitely capable of handling at least 1080p , and i cannot get even that
i actually can set it to 1080p , but i immediately get a black screen with colorful bar code gibberish
can not get a setting for anything higher than 1080p , and definitely cannot actually use 1080p
i am open to suggestions on how to fix this , especially if the seller is reading this
i will bump this to <NUM> stars if they can help me resolve this ( i will send an inquiry if i cannot get it fixed soon ) .
here is what you want to know
the stand is fine
there are only <NUM> working buttons on this
this is the power button , a brightness button ( s ) , and volume buttons
there is no other screens , setups , no calibrations , etc
all of that has to be done on your pc connected to this
it is literally a straight monitor
as advertised , not <NUM> dead pixel
resolutions excellent
there is a powerbrick with this item ( just an fyi )
haven not had any issues with it
to mount the monitor on the monitor mount , put the backend on first , then put the big base on the <NUM> feet , screw them in ( recommend using a drill on a very low setting to affix it
the dvi connector is a good length
i'd recommend it
went from a dual monitors at 1920x1080 ( 24 inch ) to this beast
night and day
i can have two documents up side by side with room to spare ( my girl reviews allot of documents , and she was liking this hunking thing too )
it is a "large" monitor ( comparable to a <NUM> inch tv )
yes the instructions are in korean , who cares
the box has the whole sparta theme on it , don not care either
it is a good monitor , good response time , awesome resolution
i would do this monitor at 2560x1600 vs a 4k monitor for <NUM> reasons
1 ) 4k monitors are $1 , 000+
yes there are cheaper ones but there cheaper because
2 ) most 4k monitors run at 30hz
basically it means that the monitor can only display 30hz
this monitor displays at <NUM> hz ( which is fantastic )
to clarify , essentially hz is pretty much how much fps a monitor can display per second
now you can have a 4k monitor but if your graphics card is kicking at <NUM> fps , your monitor will only support <NUM> fps of it ( its a dumbed down version of it but hz matter , and you want at least 60 , if not more3 ) 4k monitors may require more than <NUM> connection ( aka <NUM> dvi port connections ) to run well
4 ) 4k is still reaaaaly new
there working the bugs out regarding creating a gaming 4k monitor that isn not over $1000
this is a <NUM> inch monitor , well under the <NUM> to <NUM> pricerange of other monitors that do the same thing as this one
to the gamers out there , loaded up counter strike , awesomenauts , eve online , all ran at this resolution , full screen , no bars .
i ordered this thing and received it , i tried for hours to get it to connect to my home wifi network but to no avail
a couple of months later i bought a smartphone and connected to my wifi network in seconds , dont buy this piece of junk .
very fast , dependable os ( way better than the wm5 ) , good buttons , nice scroll device , good battery life , bt and wifi works very well , the only glitch is that it would be nice to have a better screen , other than that is nearly perfect .
it doesn not connect
it reckognizes that there is internet service &<HASHTAG> ; somewhere&<HASHTAG> ; but after i get to the network screen
it doesn not connect .
this is the best thing i have ever bought , get a wireless signal is the easiest , using the device is the best , and overall this is the best thing i have bought .
the dell axim x30 <NUM> mhz was released in 2004
it still has a lot going for it ; it is sleek , compact , and attractive , it is got bluetooth and wifi , and a <NUM> mhz processor ( the fastest processor available then )
but i can not imagine why anyone would want to buy this outdated model , especially since the price listed here for a brand new unit is higher than what it retailed for in 2004
it uses windows mobile <NUM> ( wm v4 ) , which isn not supported by ms anymore
the current version of windows mobile is 6
additionally , dell has discontinued the axim x30 since 2007
you will have trouble getting support from dell if you run into any problems
but complaints about it being outdated aside , the dell axim x30 has a few significant problems with it : 1 ) a problem commonly reported is the backup battery going bad or burning out
there is no way to replace it unless you want to venture into cracking the case open and soldering the right kind of battery on
2 ) a lot of users , like myself , have the problem with the storage spontaneously disappearing
the ppc doesn not "see" the drive anymore ; it is like it doesn not even exist
3 ) activesync frequently fails to sync some task and calendar items
4 ) pathetic battery life
i can squeeze about 2
5 hours from the battery it comes with - and that is with bluetooth ans wifi turned off and the screem dimmed down
5 ) on my x30 , the power/data connector completely broke loose
i would advise you to pass this up .
this pda came out in , and it was a great pda for this period
mine is still functional in 2012
i have had numerous pda is ; from the palm m series to hp is jornada and ipaq to a toshiba and an asus mypal a716
this dell axim a30 unit is by far - hands down - the most impressive unit that i have used
the unit is quite light and the display is very vibrant compared to the asus a716 ( also still functional after all these years )
it does not hang wile multitasking or viewing pictures - soft resets are few and far between
even refurbished , these are very reliable - an gadget for all your needs ( i prefer having my contacts on a device that is not my phone )
shame that it does not come with a bottle and can opener or you would have a complete survival tool for urban living !
never had one of these before , and i love mine
limit , as far as performance--can not take an sd card bigger than 2g ( no sdhc cards ) , and only runs windows mobile <NUM> se
still works great for what it does
can connect via 802
11b to just about any hotspot available , and plenty of apps still floating around the net for windows mobile 2003 , but if you have the money , as i didn not , i would suggest the axim x50 , the last of the axim series dell made .
i bought this to go with my new acer aspire one
i also wanted an external burner that is lightweight and small
this one worked immediately right out of the box and is everything it is decribed to be
fast service from the seller with several alerts from the seller , too
a real pleasure .
i couldn not use this drive with acer is aspire one erecovery utility but have determined it is acer is software problem , not a problem with the drive itself
but what i learned in trying to get help from cbear was that ( 1 ) they can barely write english , ( 2 ) their first strategy is to send you all of the scripts that have nothing to do with your problem and , ( 3 ) if you persist , they will express doubt that there is a problem but will ( grudgingly ) agree to let you return the product
i didn not need to do that because the drive works with software other that acer is erecovery but note that returns subtract <PERCENT> of the purchase price plus you pay for shipping
i determined that the drive i received is an unlabeled oem toshiba drive and that is a respectable brand .
i needed an external cdrw/dvd drive for my toshiba nb205
the acer aspire one usb external dvd/cdrw cd burner suits my need perfectly
for my purposes , a drive has to read and write disks reliably and quietly ; that is it
i don not need it to be especially fast or to look pretty
fortunately , for me this external drive is quiet , unobtrusive , and reliable
it has one eccentricity that i have found
it comes with two usb cables - one for data , one for power - and so you might find yourself in the position of connecting two usb cables from your laptop to this device
i do think it is weird
i have never seen this before
i have had no technical problems of any kind with this device
i am thoroughly satisfied .
not much to say here
good value
works as described
a little bigger than it needs to be , but does the job .
tengo una mini y no tiene unidad de disco , este producto ha sido de muchisima utilidad para la reproducci&oacute ; n y grabacion en cds
i bought this because my compaq dvd drive is not working too well
the external drive installed and seemed to do its stuff without any problems on win7
it comes with an extra usb cable to provide extra power to the drive if your primary usb port is not sufficient , on the acer i use for streaming to my tv , it was just plug in and use , no further installation was required , also a win7 machine .
the acer aspire netbook is sold with windows xp operating system
this dvd/cd burner is sold with the windows me driver , a generation behind the xp
i tried downloading an updated driver from microsoft , no go
i tried contacting cbear , hoping they would support their product , nothing ! $25 paperweight is now what i have
amazon should drop cbear as a
( it is not microsoft is job to support cbear is hardware , it is cbear is job to support their product
not even ansering my email is not acceptable
i bought this drive to go with my netbook , since netbooks are too small for a drive with removable media
i based my decision on size , price , and the fact that you do not need to use two usb cables to power this up
this plays cd is and dvd is as well as any internal drive in a laptop
i can watch movies , play music and install software
no big deal to pack it with the netbook and take it with you
excellent product , would highly recommed .
i have had this for a couple months
used it to load win7 on a acer netbook
worked just great .
dont buy this unit
it is a and i needed a dvd writer
it does not read dvds but read cd
absolute waste of money .
i have a <NUM> 1/2 in
computer with no disk drive and i needed to get my computer updated as much as possible
this is working wonders and i am slowly cleaning my computer off of the old stuff and putting on new or updated programs .
i just the details of this product and still can not find any mention of the fact that this device is a read only device and will not create/burn cds or dvds
i am very very with the product and with amazon for carrying it .
i had no problem with my red dvd/cd player
i pluged it in and worked immediately in my three laptops
i have a ten year old hp laptop that i don not use much , but i pluged the external usb in it just to see if it would work on an old one , and it worked fine
i bought this dvd/cd player to use with a netbook that i bought , but it has not arrived yet , so i can not tell if it will work in the netbook
if i have any problems with it i will update this review later on .
drive simply will not mount
i imagine this must be fine for the person it works for but i am returning mine as .
i must add this review since this is a great product at a ridiculously low price
i needed a cd/dvd player to install programs to my new netbook
installation was easy ; just pluged in the two usb cables and it worked immediately
i upload microsoft professional office <NUM> quickly and easily
it does play movies , i played my harry potter movie with no problems
the vlc media player was already installed
i highly recommend this player
this external usb dvd/cd drive is perfect for netbooks and laptops needing an external drive to handle cds and dvds
the drive itself is slim and light , ready to travel with your netbook
it conveniently draws its operating power through the connecting cord to a netbook or laptop usb port
assuming your laptop or netbook has a media player , you should be ready to utilize this drive right out of the box
the drive is not necessarily ruggedized , so some care with handling is advisable
highly recommended .
this goes great with my acer netbook
i use it a lot to import things from other computers
it makes things so much more convenient .
works as advertised
i needed a replacement for the internal drive on my lenovo y510 which had failed
since the failure on the internal drive had happened before , i didn not want to deal with that again
having an external drive is a little unhandy but once the os had been loaded on it , an internal drive would be rarely needed .
i use this thing way more than i thought i ever would
great little product , can be a pain if your usb ports are to close together .
i bought the blue one for my son is blue toshiba netbook , and it matches exactly
it arrived with two cables and instructions , but i only needed the usb cable
i plugged it in , the driver software loaded , and it worked ! it is small and quiet , and works perfectly for a great price .
this external drive has helped me a lot , it comes in handy when your mac , notebook or netbook cd/dvd drive is not working .
i had a small notebook computer which had no internal dvd/cd drive so i purchased this
i have used it to run and install countless programs and not once has it ever given me trouble
i have also installed and played many games and it has a fast read speed and gets the job done in a timely fashion , i highly recommend .
i have purchased a small laptop ( netbook type ) for use as a large tablet
it has a touch screen and windows <NUM> installed
however , it does not have an optical drive ( too small of a footprint )
to load some of my favorite programs requires a cd/dvd drive
this unit meets that need very nicely
it is effective , quiet and seems to draw minimum power with just one usb cable .
i got this to use with a linux based xbmc media center on a zbox as the dvd player
it was recognized out of the box
it plays dvds great , until it just quits
i will have to buy another drive as this one is not working for me .
this drive was not recognizable by either a windows <NUM> pc or a windows <NUM> tablet
got similar item ( $5 more ) from microcenter and it was plug and play .
it is okay and easy to use but feels a bit flimsy although i don not use it often , so i am glad i have it
but haven not had great luck with dvds and not sure if wrong type disc or what .
i bought this to replace another external drive that was only a dvr ( i needed a cd/cdrw/dvd )
i opened my very carefully wrapped and packaged drive and was pleased to see that it stated cd/cdrw/dvd right on the front of it ! i was unsure of the <NUM> cords as well , but i plugged them both into my dell netbook , and it worked right away
the only thing i don not like is that when you eject , you have to kind of pull the tray out
it also seems just a tad sensitive if you touch it while it is working
other than that , a great deal and good product !
there are times that a dvd drive is essential , such as installing office , this does the job throught the usb connection .
i needed to get this external usb dvd/cd device , for a laptop i have that doesn not have a cd/dvd drive in it
i was very pleased when this arrived , and it didn not need any set up
all i had to do was hook it to the laptop , and it worked very smoothly and easily
this is a solidly good product , and for a good price , and so far it is working very well
however i felt that it is a bit sensitive to the touch when it is working , so the user has to be a little careful with it .
i bought this external usb for my netbook and it works great for downloading programs
in fact i have been lending out to other family members
no complaints here .
it works fine to play dvds
haven not used it in other applications yet
as others have said you have to download a media player if you have windows 8
i used vlc media free download .
sometimes cheap is good
you go a long way with your buck
with this machine i ended up spending more money since it malfunctioned ever since the beginning
my computer wouldn not even recognize the damn thing
i had to install a load of drivers and still it malfunctioned
i would recommend getting a pricier apparatus that is guaranteed working from the moment you plug it in .
i like it but it does take a minute to come on and is quite a pain going from one science to another
other than that it is okay !
the description didn not say what brand the dvd drive was , so i assumed i would be getting a cheap chinese generic drive
however , when i opened the package , it was a brand new lg drive ! i was very thrilled to get that for only $25
the drive is very thin and made of aluminum
the drive features a and works decently
i used it to install microsoft office <NUM> and star wars battlefront ii on my asus t101mt tablet pc without any issues
plus , lg is a you can trust ! i highly recommend this dvd drive as you get the best bang for you buck !
i bought this external drive when the drive on my computer died
buying an external drive was cheaper than hiring a computer repair person to come to my home and put in a new drive
the drive works ok , nothing spectacular -- it appears a little flimsy , but so far , no problems
i rarely use it , but bought it for those times when i want to watch a dvd movie or install new software that is delivered on a cd .
pros : full system in a small case
cons : having t use <NUM> usb portsto transfer and power system is a drawback
overall a good external system
i purchased this player for my <NUM> year old daughters acer aspire one netbook d255e for her to play dvds , games and to load norton <NUM> on the netbook
item arrived quickly in a box combined with other items from amazon , simply wrapped in one layer of bubble wrap and put in the box
there were no receipts etc for the shipment , and only a small booklet for installation on older windows os systems
the booklet did mention that the unit is a cd/dvd burner , but required additional software to do so ( i checked on my acer <NUM> laptop after plugging it in and running a diagnostic check , it is only a dvd/cd player )
it also came with a usb driver disc which was unnecessary for my installation , and two usb plugs , one for media and one for power
simple to figure out though , just plug in both usb plugs and windows <NUM> starter did the rest
however , like others with windows <NUM> starter , i had to download vlc media player to play dvd is
no problem there , except for the additional junk that came with the media player download which i immediately deleted
the cd/dvd player works great now , and sounds especially awesome on earbuds
i have a windows anytime upgrade from starter to full home version ready to install , but i may return it now that i have this dvd/cd rom working and the free desktop download correction fixed
cons : i was let down that so many others purchased the same unit and received a free upgrade to a dvd/cd burner
that is not a real major setback since this is for a <NUM> yr olds netbook , but it would have been nice to have as a back up to our other burner
one for all and all for one i say ! pros : easy , i mean easy setup
also found it nice that you do not need to utilize both usb cables , just plug in the media plug to the usb <NUM> and that is all required
great price considering the seller guaranteed it would work with my acer one netbook model
free shipping ! case seems to be sturdy enough , ( just don not pick it up and turn it side to side while it is playing )
region settings available , so it plays most everything
great dvd picture on both my acer laptop and the acer aspire one netbook , very pleased ! overall , i would recommend this to anyone needing a dvd/cd rom for the acer aspire one netbook , provided you do not want a unit for burning cd is and dvd is
update <NUM> march 2011 : the more i use this player the more i like it
the picture on my daughters acer aspire one netbook is sharper than the one on my acer laptop with widescreen hd
if you are an acer netbook lover , this is the external player for you
just a reminder , it is not a dvd/cd burner
final update : i finally upgraded my daughters acer one netbook from windows starter to windows <NUM> and the new os picked up this player with no external help required for drivers etc
i also upgraded to 2gb memory , ( see my other reviews ) , which took all of about <NUM> minutes to accomplish ! my daughter is playing video games and watching dvd movies off this little player like there is no tomorrow ! i am amazed that this player has performed as it has
total thumbs up for quality and performance ! i upgraded to <NUM> stars , simply based on the overall performance and lifespan thus far
for the price you simply cannot go wrong !
no problems so far except unable to upload a program cd
not sure if it was the cd/dvd my computer or the software but just that one disc
that disc works in my desk top but not in this unit
not sure why
all other dvd is and cd is have been working without a problem .
this usb dvd/cd external drive works like a charm ! very simple to set up , have been using it with my imac that does not have an internal disk drive
computer recognized it immediately
the drive is very light and portable .
item description says nothing about this item being a dvd/cd r/w unit
however after reading reviews , many said they were burning cds with this unit so i purchased it
the unit i received installed easy and was identified in device manager as a sony ddu810awhen i opened my burning software , no writers were recognized
specs on this unit indicate writing function as n/aapparenty this company is shipping different items under this description as others have said that their unit was imprinted with dvd/cd r/wthe unit i received says a nice external portable unit for playing cds and dvdsthis is not b a burner
basic dvd player for the computer
plug it in and it works
so far so good .
could not get my acer netbook to accept this device
returned it
eventually got a true plug and play lg one--had much more luck
i bought this external dvd for my mini dell
it works great but it does not play all region dvds
it only plays regions 1
kept trying to view some anime & regular cartoons , but no can do
otherwise it is a ok drive .
i use cr123a batteries like candy , i didn not know they were rechargeable till a colleague of mine happened to have a set
i quickly got on amazon and found this kit which has been a life saver
the ability to charge them either from a <NUM> wall outlet or a 12v car charger is invaluable , particularly if travel between countries .
very powerful batteries , use it a lot and doesn not have to care about spare batteries , great price for the package
these batteries are good and so is the charger
for my husbands police small flashlight , this is great , especially the car charger !
this is a great kit , everything works as it should
fast service from the seller
didn not realize there was a car plug adapter included , this will come in handy .
i haven not had these long , but they appear to work
only time will tell how long they hold a charge and how many times i can recharge them
price was good though .
if you are like us , and you have tactical flashlites and night lights on your firearms , you know it is no fun to pay $10 for <NUM> to <NUM> hours of light
these pay for themselves in no time at all
with that said , i will repost if they fail early or quit retaining full charge
so far we have about <NUM> charges and recharges
we have had them for about <NUM> months .
two of the batteries never worked
i contacted them about replacements and they wanted me to jump through so many hoops i just figured it was not worth the effort
lesson learned .
i needed a replacement battery for a davis weather station , which uses solar cells to power the remote sensors
after finding out that batteries only lasted weeks , the realization finally penetrated my thick skull that a solar cell won not do much for a battery
i bought this product , and am very happy with it
my weather station is happy again , the charger itself ( which i have only used for the initial charge ) worked quickly and without a hitch
the product design is pleasant and fool proof
i am a satisfied customer .
the batteries work and the recharger , recharges
you cannot ask for more so this product has my blessing
it was also a great buy and saved me some coin so it really has my blessing ! thanks for providing a great product at a great price !
original : these batteries have been excellent for my flashlight and work four about <NUM> hours on full power
not much else to say except that these are great money savers for high powered lights like mine
update 9/14/2013 : these batteries are still running as strong as they were when i purchased them , so i have increased my rating from <NUM> to <NUM> stars
they work great in my work light , fenix tk35 , which is a highly demanding power consuming unit
i completely recommend these for anyone who is a leo , ems or similar line of work .
i made the mistake of abandoning my normal principal of "you get what you pay for"i was excited to find these so inexpensively and had planned to use them in my master controller for photography
the "quality" batteries for this unit average around $16
00 each , so the idea of getting four batteries with a charger cheaper than the cost of two normal batteries was just appealing to my "green sense"
now i am back to the single use batteries , as these rechargeable is let me down time and again
when freshly charged , they often showed voltage ratings well above 4v and this isn not workable in my units
so , i let them run down a tad and they are usable for a blink , then run down quickly under normal use
also , if they are not equally discharged and charged in twos , the charger will show both charged , while they are not equal upon removal
one battery showing a voltage rating of 2
2 and the other 4
0 fresh from the charger
i consider this to be a real problem and potentially damaging sensitive equipment if using a battery that actually has a overcharged condition
batteries rated at <NUM> volts shouldn not show over <NUM> while in service
and again , drain quickly
i should get <NUM> cycles from my by nikon with a fresh battery
with these , it is more like disappointed
i can not provide a review of how these batteries perform in other equipment , but if you need something that performs as "rated" with meaningful performance life , based on my experience with this group
please continue shopping for something better
smart charger- charges unpredictably3
0v batteries hold unstable charges ( based on my experience with those shipped to me ) charged life- very short , around <PERCENT> of that of a normal single use battery ( based on the group i received ) if you need something quick and cheap for equipment with a broad operating range , then you may get something out of these
i just can not personally recommend them
sorry .
i bought some of these to try with a light using <NUM> a is
they work as advertised
when you check them with a meter they show over <NUM> volts , but under load they do not hurt the light
have been using them for a while now
hold a charge very well , and no longer have to buy throw away 123a is .
these batteries work flawlessly
the charger is why i dropped a star
sometimes it doesn not recognize the batteries .
i bought these for use in my flashlights , steripen adventurer , and msr miox
the chargers work better than the solar counterparts but any use overseas you better take the solar chargers
still , they arrived quickly and have worked well every time .
i have had this kit for a few months now and have recharged a pair of the batteries <NUM> times , and a third battery once
so far everything works as expected
i use them in a fenix p3d premium <NUM> ( luxeon rebel led , <NUM> - <NUM> lumens ) , and a fenix p1 ce ( cree <NUM> led - <NUM> lumens )
for me the performance is very acceptable considering how inexpensive the kit was
i get maybe an hour to /2 hours total runtime depending which brightness levels i am using
i don not use the lights for more than <NUM> or <NUM> minutes at a time anyway so that is plenty of uses between charges for me
a nice plus is you get the car charger adapter included , too
most kits require you to buy that separately at additional cost
probably the only thing i would have liked with the kit is some kind of pouch to keep it all together
i made a carrying case out of an old zippered memory card/battery case i had hanging around
it just happens to all fit perfectly but it took an awful lot of finagling to make that happen ! update just wanted to update this review to say i am still using these cells and they are still working great
i think the runtime has improved after a few charge/recharge cycles ( which is what is supposed to happen ) , so these are lasting even longer in my lights now
i only recharge them maybe every <NUM> months with occasional use of my lights
still highly recommended
update guess it is time for my now yearly update on these batteries
they are still all going strong ! i still only recharge them about every <NUM> months but that is because they have a very good charge retention and capacity
another big surprise involving these batteries occurred over the summer ( 2010 )
i keep my fenix p1 ce light on my keychain
to turn the light on and off you screw and unscrew the head slightly
if you unscrew it all the way the head comes off ( that how you replace the battery )
i guess the head had loosened in my pocket because one day as i was walking to my car i removed my car keys from my pocket
i stepped on something hard and happened to look down to see what it was
well , it turned out to be one of these batteries ! i had slightly deformed the top of the battery and ripped part of the plastic that makes up the case of the battery
i didn not have anything to lose so i trimmed off the plastic that was torn , and sealed the case up with some super glue
fortunately , the battery still fit in the flashlight and it worked fine - still had a full charge ! i have since charged it twice and it is still working great
still highly recommended !
run time in my regulated jetbeam flashlight was about <PERCENT> of what it should be with these batteries which were freshly charged
well under powered and capacity
they are going to be replaced immediately with any battery other than this one
these batteries will see second string duty .
the charger took about <NUM> hours to give two rc123a 3
0v 900mah rechargeable protected batteries a charge of <PERCENT>
so for <NUM> batterys figure <NUM> hours
i only use one at a time so that is roughly four nights on my nod
additional information - i used it by doing a direct plugin to my solar charger and it powered up two rc123a batteries to <PERCENT> charge in an <NUM> hour ( sunrise till sunset ) day
the link for the amanzon solar charger is : <URL>
this is exactly what i needed for my wireless flash commander
it sure beats buying these batteries as often as i was
i definitely recommend it .
got one for home , and one for the car
work great , but sometimes don not last as long as the versions
great for training days for my tactical lights , as i can use one up and grab another from the charger .
after just two cycles of the batteries , they stopped working in my tactical flashlight
i measured the voltage and found them to be almost 4
2 volts fully charged ( when it is supposed to be 3
0 ! )
i don not know if this can damage a voltage regulated light , but i am not willing to take the chance ( they don not work in two separate types of flashlights i have anyway because they immediately shut off when turned on with these batteries now )
i am returning these and buying some surefire batteries
what good is a tactical flashlight if at the exact moment you need it to work , the batteries fail ? and if you aren not using it for tactical purposes , then why get a light with cr123a batteries in the first place ? even when this charger was working ( only on the first cycle ) , it got way too hot for comfort while charging and took way longer than it says
also , the light turns halfway to green but stays halfway red , and doesn not charge both batteries evenly .
do not buy these batteries and this little 'handy kit' if you want a battery you can rely on
my experience using them in flashlights ( fenix , sure fire , etc ) has been dismal
full charge = one hour of istrobe'
contacted vendor and was told that "these cells vary" and that "replacing them wouldn not help"
so what would help ? ! ? ! basically , the vendor says that these cells are worthless and unreliable
is that what you are looking for ? go elsewhere
the battery sucks and the vendor sucks .
imagine that you dont have to worry that you forgot to turn your flash off or it got flipped on in your camera bag
imagine you never have to worry that your battery will die on you
and it came fast in great packagaing
thanks .
i bought these to power my wife is first high output led flashlight
they did work , but did not last nearly as long as i'd expected
the charger worked fine and we had no real issues with the batteries , we just weren not impressed
i ended up replacing each pair with a single panasonic <NUM> ma <NUM> battery and have been much happier
we ended up giving these away , along with the flashlight to my when we upgraded the wife is flashlight to something with a little more punch .
the right charge slot works fine , but the left one insists on flashing ( indicating bad cell ) when ever i use it , even with cells that charge fine in the right slot
since i only need to charge one cell at a time , i can live with it , but it is peculiar .
charges quickly
very good set for the price
will review more when field tested
using it for my tactical flashlight used for le work .
i bought this for my ipod 2g
i wanted to take advantage of skype calling my family
the mic itself is small , about as big as a horse pill or a paperclip to you youngins who don not know that a horse pill is any big a* pill you try to swallow
lol i have a little pouch in my purse i keep it in so i don not lose it
because you will lose it
the sound was good when i recorded a voice memo
but you have to remove it to hear anything back
that is the kicker ! it is a restriction of the device , not the mic
i thought i could use the mic to speak and my bluetooth headphones to listen at the same time
no such luck
you have to get the ipod headphones with built in mic/recorder to do that
so all i can use this for is to record stuff and listen later
but it was cheap , so it is still a cool addition to my toys
oh , and i also got the ipod headphones with mic
those too live in my little pouch of goodies
worked well for my older ipods , but it was purchased to enhance iphone recording
however , there is no increased quality or functionality with the iphone over the built in mic .
works as advertised
a bit large , so interferes with plugging in usb charge cord
and , of course , with this plugged in it turns off the speakers .
this little microphone transforms my ipod into something much more useful for recording events
there is no way to listen at the same time , but that was advertised as such
thank you .
i just got my mini mic and my chill pill rapcap in the mail today
i bought both for my ipod class 120gig for recording lectures
i didnt want to get one at a time to compare so i just bought both
my mini mic cost me $
34 and just under $4 shipping and rapcap was $14
50 and free shipping
i compared both for sound quality and distance at which they pick up sound
turns out the only difference is the rapcap is white plastic spray painted pretty while the mini mic is either white or black plastic
also the rapcap is about
5mm smaller in diameter but same size in length
the caps construction is identical
both work identical
everything is the same
the only thing to test is durability but i am confident it will be the same
so save the money and buy this one over the rapcap
they pick up sound great from a distance if you have it about <NUM> feet away from an instructor so just plug it in and stand it up near the instructors desk or sit near where he or she talks and youll be fine
i have a flip open case so i can plug mine in and stand it up so ill pick up sound great
only complaint i have is that i bought the rapcap too .
when i wanted to use my ipod to record some reminders to myself i looked around for a compatible microphone expecting to pay $25 to $50 or more and having a twenty page instruction book to study , but then i found this little gem at a great price and no instruction book to study and it works like a charm for me , just plug it in and go
i wish all tech stuff could be this easy .
ipod 5g/5
5g do not support lin in microphones ! do not buy unless you have a 6g 120gb
we received our order in three days which was super fast
the microphone that we received is actually white but that is not an issue for us
we put it on our year old touch that our son plays with so that he can play all of his talking animal games
despite reviews that stated it didn not work because the thinks there are headphones in , we have not had that issue with any of our talking games with the exception of the talking angela game
i put the mic in and rebooted the and it worked perfectly
i thought perhaps i would have to remove the case based on other reviews but there was no issue there either
i was actually ready to take my to the apple store and see if we could have a mic added but this $3
00 dollar microphone was the answer for us .
i have a ipod touch i bought this item before i realized that my ipod already has a built in mic and so haven not used this mic and never needed it .
these work for the itouch 64gb but they sometimes skip when recording
you can not hear what you are recording
the sound quality is okay
i did get this product fast through the mail .
this products work for what i was using it for ( an old ipod touch )
i am pleased but this is very easy to lose .
wouldn not buy this again
i never really used the product because it didnt fit the phone that well with the phone case on .
i bought my mic from crazyfrog , not expecting that great of a mic due to the price
it shipped very fast , and i recieved it in perfect condition
it works just as well as , if not better than , my mic that came with an iphone
it works great with my ipod touch 2nd generation mc model
i would strongly advise anyone to buy this who is looking for a high quality mic at a low price
dont let those bad reviews scare you ! i dont know about the quality from other sellers , but crazyfrog delivered mine in perfect condition
great buy .
i gave this five stars because for the price , this tiny microphone is excellent
i needed a small unobtrusive mic to record university lectures to my 3rd generation ipod touch
i can report that this mic works perfectly
if you need fancy cut offs , filters , or you expect concert quality results , please go elsewhere
if you want something that works well for much less than $10 , get this mic or get a couple of them .
this mic sounds surprisingly great ! it picks up a wide range of frequencies very nicely ! my only complaint is that it is easy to lose , but there is nothing the manufacturer could do about that .
i purchased from and it arrived quickly
the microphone was readily accepted by my ipod touch 3g and allows me to make voice memos
i also tried it for a skype call and it works ! note other reviewers have noted you can not both have it in the ipod touch to use as a microphone and hear sound from the speakers - this is a limitation of the ipod touch , and i refuse to give this item a negative review based on the limitations of the ipod touch like so many others have
you can use it to make a skype call , and both speak into the microphone and hear through the speakers if you set the call to "speaker , " either when making or receiving a call
it is about the size of a very large pill
i am very pleased with the seller and the item .
small , compact , easy to carry around
followed the instructions and it worked perfectly
it is not a broadcast quality microphone , but for everyday voice use it is a great , portable solution .
not as good as the built in mic of my nexus 4 , which i was looking to improve
there is some static on all recordings , and i am not sure what to do about it
it was cheap , so i am not too broken hearted about it .
when i bought my itouch a few years back , i didnt like the fact that it had no mic
so i started doing some searching here on amazon
com and i found one and still have it today
i was able to ptt ( press to talk ) like a walkie talkie and other stuff
i like it .
you must unplug the microphone unit to hear any replay/sounds
i will hack it in the future in order to allow sounds while it is plugged in .
didn not work on my iphone or ipods
loved that it is compact
wasn not out much money luckily
do not recommend .
this an awesome product
it was cheap and works well
i use it to record lectures in college so i can listen to them again .
it works perfect
the only thing is it is so small
like i think i have seriously swallowed medications larger than this device
good item
would recomend to anyone .
i love this mic it works on itouch 3generation <NUM> gb so well
i love it too much and wat a money saver too
nothing more to say but to order it soon !
received this item today
plugged it in and thought that i should have read the reviews first
but there were also alot of good reviews
so , i tried to think what was going on , plugging it in first it said "no microphone" when i went to my recording app
i don not know if it did not go in all the way with the case on my ipod , but i had to charge it and when i tried again with the case off , it did work
in order to listen to what you have recorded , you have to disconnect the microphone
made sure it was pushed in all the way when i put the case back on .
this is a very good seller
the product arrived exactly on the estimated date of arrival
the only problem i have is that the mic has no speakers , so you need to unplug it to listen to the ipod again .
useless piece of device for a device that already has a mic
the performance is very average
! looks smooth tho .
i thought i could use something like this to enhance the tiny pin hole mic on my tablet but this thing is actually worse
when doing a test recording the pin hole mic on the tablet was times as loud during playback and the fidelity of the sound was higher from the built in tablet mic
about the only way to could get anything to even register was to speak directly into the holes on this mic from an inch away .
it does not work
when you plug it in , it disables the speakers and then the ipod is practically silent
not a good idea .
i needed this for my ipod touch and also ordered a few extras because i lose little things easily
this mic has provided much use and definitely of better quality than i was expecting it to be
i have even recommended this to a couple of friends .
sensitivity is slightly on the low side
records loud static noise every three seconds
otherwise , it is a good product .
this item works with an 4 , 4s and a samsung galaxy s3
the microphone picks up sound <NUM> time better than the built in phone mic
the shipping time was a little long but that is clearly stated when you purchase it
this lets you use your phone as a digital recorder
i will buy another one
as a microphone this thing works fine
however if you are trying to turn your itouch into a skype phone forget it as the volume on itouch just isn not loud enough
i have found out that the only way to use the itouch as s skype phone is to use the headphones that include a mic
and then if you have skype in , forget it because you will never hear the thing ring
but the mic works and it is little money .
good product does the job
good price
it has a carrying case
i used for the ipod does a good job .
i plugged it in and it worked
it is small , but taking it with you is a challenge
how about making it into a key chain ?
this is a fantastic tool if you are recording anything from business meetings , you can even use it for the app shazam
it really cool
not for use for the voip though .
this microphone does what it states , but nothing more
it does record sound , and that can be very handy for an idevice , but at the cost of the external speakers ( if it has one ) being shut off
the original reason i bought this was for the use of skype , but i can not due to the speakers getting shut off
also , the size can be helpful ( not a obstruction ) , but it is also easily losable
* speaker when in the end , buy this if you need it for the voice memos , shazam , an certain voice apps , but with other applications , such as skype , this won not do very well .
it is simple and works well for me
sellers say you have to purchase an additional app , but mine works fine with the included 'memo' app on my ipod touch 2g
down side is that you have unplug it to listen to the recording .
i use this product all the time since i am on voxer
i needed a microphone and this product is great because it is small and not as noticeable
i really love it
i don not know what i was thinking buying this piece of junk
i guess you get what you pay for
invest in quality and stay away from this thing
seriously .
nice add on for those who have an ipod touch
not a miracle worker but provides microphone capability .
sd ultra micro sdxc card has worked without flaw so far
it is been up to this point in transfering and managing all my audio files ( ~29gb ) from my hp laptop to my samsung note 10
1 <NUM> edition
i have also purchased compatible sd micro cards for my samsung galaxy iii cell phones which have worked out better than the kingston cards that i had originally purchased .
i like it , but a little expensive compared to others i saw online after purchasing
other than that , it is good .
i bought this on march 4th , 2014
suddenly even thought the storage in settings showed the card with used and free space , no app could find any files on it
had to dismount , remove it and reinsert it for it to work , but it is erratic ! while in the middle of playing mp3s on it , all the files disappeared
this is happening over and over
very disappointing !
i had a couple of problems with having to reset my device so it could read the sd card before
i like to save any applications i can to it to save room on my device
worked great for a couple of months after that
then since yesterday , it just stopped reading and started saying damaged card and try to format
i formatted it , and it still wont read the sd card
this was a horrible waste of my money
i am very upset .
works as described
have not had an issue with my samsung galaxy note 10
1 2014
there was a surprise when it arrived though : there was an sd adapter card with it
did not read that in the description when i ordered the card .
just got back from a week in london and paris
i used this adapter to power my hp laptop and i used it is usb port to charge my blackberry bold , iphone 3gs , and ipod touch with no problems at all
the lights are really handy
the power light lets you know it is plugged into a working ac wall plug
i found that not all plugs in the chicago and houston airports are working , so having the light was really handy for finding a working outlet
the second , usb , light gets brighter or dimmer as power is pulled by the usb device
for example ; when my blackberry was plugged in and recharging , the light glowed somewhat dimmly , but when i made a call , the light glowed more brightly
so you can tell when you have a good connection to your usb device
overall , it is well built and easy to operate
i will be keeping this in my travel bag .
ordered sept
<NUM> from another company on amazon for $5
24 which included shipping
i sent it with a gift to someone in the uk
item is finished well , the different interlocking plugs cleverly designed and fit together snugly
came with instructions and carrying pouch
only trouble i had when testing it here before sending it was pushing my computer is power cord plug into the ac receptacle
very difficult at first to force it without it seeming it would break but after many tries finally got it
much easier after that
the usb slot and its light worked , but the second light for the ac receptacle did not
however , the receptacle worked fine and charged my computer through it
the usb light did not go off when the device charging through it was fully charged
also , another switch was shown in the instruction diagram ( i don not remember what it was supposed to be for ) that wasn not on the adapter
recipient uses the usb slot to charge a camera and mp3 player and reports it is working fine for those devices
thrilled to have the eu plug too
if it lasts , great product and very cost effective .
i purchased <NUM> universal travel ac wall adapters , with usb charger , for my daughters' trips to europe
both units worked for about <NUM> day or less , when they stopped working during use
they used them with dual voltage camera battery chargers
i had also given them straight plug adapters
thank god that i did ! the straight plug adapters , which i bought in 1999 , still worked , and lasted them the rest of the trip
good thing i also included usb charger units
so they could not charge <NUM> items at the same time , since the new wall adapters broke , but they got their gadgets charged with the other plugs
i put in a request to return these to the seller ( handhelditems )
and they did not honor it because i bought it a few months back , but the kids' trips were not until the past few weeks
i guess i should have tried them out after we first got them .
this product does not deserve the <NUM> stars the other reviewers gave it
one reviewer got the wrong product , apparently ( which has to do with the seller ) , while the other doesn not seem to realize that the usb port is for charging peripherals , not a computer
pros : -has basically all plug adapters you need or easily removable
- , good quality plastic , kind of like usb power port rated at for ac power and usb powercons : -does not say , but unit says
should work in japan , but haven not tested it
notes : *do not pay full price at a retailer for this item ! i got mine from the seller in this listing
it was delivered in a simple with instruction sheet , no packaging
*i love the lights on this thing
you can plug in and know right away if there is ac
*furthermore , the usb lights up depending on the current being drawn and thus flickers when something is
know what this means ? it means you can tell at a glance if your device is <PERCENT> charged ! do not your devices to <PERCENT> ! the "memory effect" is a myth
the real culprit is your battery
charge your devices until the usb flickers and then remove them
*keep in mind that , as with all modern plug converters , your primary device must be rated to use mains power
this adapter will not or voltage ( unnecessary with modern electronics )
the only possible improvements to this would be if there was an extra usb port or if it was somehow rotatable
this thing kicks ass and is a great bargain compared to the other junk out there that is either or and doesn not have usb power .
these are great , the usb port is especially handy
small size , and all the adapters i could want
at first it seemed to light to do it is job but it is working great
it is the only adapter that i use when travelling .
this is very handy and it charges two things at once easily
i usually charge my laptop and ipod touch in this at the same time and have not had problems with it so far
it also has all of its individual parts for the various plugs it is capable of fitting in all contained within itself , which is very handy because you don not have to remember where you put the eu plug or the us plug , etc !
these were a ! i bought <NUM> of these and i was a little unsure of the quality based on the price of this item , but was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked for me over <NUM> weeks in europe and uk
stayed in over <NUM> hotels and on a train sleeper car and never had a problem
i travel with a cpap breathing machine and it was critical to have power every night so i could sleep
i also had an iphone and my brother had an ipad and the usb charger was great for both
i could also use one plug to both power the cpap and charge the iphone
it was really nice to have the red lights that indicated that you had power since many outlets in europe and uk have some sort of switch that turns the power off to each individual outlet
also , on the train , the red light wast coming on and let me know that the outlet wasn not working
i worked with the conductor to get some circuit breakers on the train reset by letting him know when the red light came back on
that was quite a time saver and great tool for that purpose
the only negative i have is that the part that holds the us plug into the device could be a little more snug
it felt like it was going to fall out at times ( and did fallout times but that wasn not much over <NUM> weeks of use )
there is one design enhancement that i would have put into this device : when using the uk converter , they could have made the bottom of the device a 2nd <NUM> outlet so that you would have <NUM> 110 outlets ( the regular one on the back and one on the bottom using the euro converter ) as well as the usb outlet
of course this may be over the amperage that one plug should carry , but it is a thought for the designers .
i bought this device so i can use my laptop and charge my phone during travel to other european countries
but few hours after using it , the fuse blew up and the device didn not work after that
very disapppointed .
product was shipped quickly from toy <NUM> kids
at first , i loved it
it is compact , has all kinds of adapters , and very lightweight -- seemed perfect for travel
my first night in italy , it plugged right in and charged both my camera battery ( in regular outlet ) and ipad ( using the usb port )
unfortunately , after the 2nd night , there were faint black burn marks on the white plastic and it failed to charge anything else after that
burnt out after just <NUM> nights ? in short , great idea but very little durability .
we are heading to europe this summer
of course , we will have an array of electronic devices with us ( camera , kindle , phones , etc
) and i wanted to make sure we could keep things charged as needed during our trip no matter where we ended up
this is a perfect solution at a very affordable price .
once upon a time i travelled with a heavy current converter and a handful of plugs to fit a variety of sockets outside the u
, all in a bulky case
now that so many electrical devices have dual voltage , the issue is to find a convenient plug adapter , and this one fits the bill
it is very cleverly designed so that all the plugs snap together into a single compact unit - no more lost parts ! - and it has the added benefit of a usb port for charging mp3 players & the like
add to that a price , and i don not know how you could ask for more .
it is good and as expected
i love to have it with me for my international travel
i love it .
this adapter is a very good investment
i have used this in europe , korea , ethiopia ( africa ) and the u
and it has not missed a beat
i really like the extra usb plugs
they work so well that i no longer carry an extra ac to usb adapter
it does have an internal fuse that cannot be replaced , but i have yet to encounter a problem
i plan to get another one
this is only an adapter , not a voltage converter
most outlets outside of the usa are 220
so be sure what you plug in is duel voltage
most cell phone chargers and laptops are duel voltage
edit : i have uploaded some pictures , please feel free to view .
we have two of these and recently used them in both ireland and sweden
it includes plugs for uk , us , european , and australian style plugs
contrary to what one other reviewer says here , it does really support australian plugs
to use it on an australian outlet with the angled slots , just twist the blades of the us plug
the fuse in one of ours was blown while trying to run a hair dryer on it
i have removed the fuse and ordered replacements
when i get it working again , i will post an update
it is marked as a <NUM> a , <NUM> v fast blowing fuse , which means that this is rated for about <NUM> w
that is about half the wattage of a typical hairdryer , so hairdryers on one of these are pretty much out of the question , but it is more than enough power for charging any kind of electronics that a traveler would carry
the red indicator leds are helpful to know that it is working , but they are fairly bright , so if bright leds in a small hotel room are a distraction from sleeping , plan ahead to cover them up with something
update : i replaced the blown fuse with one of these : quality usa brand fuses ! set of <NUM> pieces , 3ag3a250v , f3al250v , f3a 250v , f3 l250v , f3a 250v , f3l250v cartridge glass fuses 6x30mm ( 1/4 in x /4 in ) , 3a 250v , ( fast acting )
everything appears to be working fine , and i now have <NUM> spares to take with me on my next trip .
the usb charger socket was totally broken and never worked
i am not sure what the two red lights were supposed to be for but i never saw either of them turn on either
it was difficult to fit grounded us plugs in without some serious shoving , and the fakey plastic ground doesn not retract so i couldn not use it on outlets that didn not have a ground socket ( common in hong kong )
it is also quite big and heavy to travel with .
i am in europe right now using this , and it hasn not let me down
i use it every morning to heat water with a immersion heater i insert in my coffee mug to make coffee each day
at other times i use it to charge my kindle , backup batteries , camera and cellphone
i wish i had purchased <NUM> so i can use more than one outlet at a time
i did bring along an extension cord , but adding more than one gadget to it slows down the charging rate
using <NUM> outlets is more efficient
i am buying an additional one for my next trip
highly recommend this one , as it is very versatile with the usb port .
great product but is not true as they say that it charges ipads , it does not charge them at all , i would rate this a perfect <NUM> stars if it did , its a pitty .
there is not much to say , other than that the price was exceptional
the adapter set is compact and appears durable
i really wanted the usb charger plug , and figured i might as well get a complete adapter set into the bargain .
this is a cable
it allows power to be transfered from and outside source to my nexus 7
it functions exactly as advertised .
cord worked great for awhile , but had recently not been working up to snuff
can not understand how a cord like this can go bad in three months
it should last a lot longer than that
won not keep my tablet fully charged when connected to the docking station
switched back to the oem cable , and what do you know ? it is charging again
definitely going to have to find a different cable
edit 10/1/2013 : nope , the cable is fine
it works great as an otg cable
i was able to load pictures and sound effects onto my work phone , as well as add files to my nexus 7
it was actually the $9 chinese charger i had purchased to use as a backup that was going bad
when i put this cable on my nexus' oem charger , it worked just fine
i do believe i will be purchasing another nexus <NUM> oem charger in the near future .
described as a better cable than the one that came with the tablet
not so ! mini usb doesn not fit and cord is very short
sending it back asap .
original review : this cable does the job but beware if you are looking for anything longer than the asus brand cable that came with the nexus <NUM> it is the same length
but the price is right and the cable seems sturdy enough
update : we recently made a trip and i took this cable along , along with the original asus charger
big mistake ! as noted in other reviews the cable was incredibly slow in charging my nexus 7
i left it plugged in overnight and it was only at <PERCENT> the next morning
when i returned home i tried the charger with this cable and found that after <NUM> minutes the batter charge increased from <PERCENT> to <PERCENT>
using the same charger and the original asus cable for the same <NUM> minutes , the battery had increases from <PERCENT> to <PERCENT>
i left the nexus <NUM> connected to the charger with the asus cable and it reached <PERCENT> charge after about an hour
the cable works fine for copying music and image files back and forth from my pc but it is sorely deficient as a charger cable
ergo the downgrade in my rating from <NUM> to <NUM> stars .
not worth your stress
fit loosely from the get go
i have two nexus <NUM> tablets and it was the same with both
went to and bought a cheap generic one and it works great .
it looks just like the real thing , however it does not hook into the port as well as the original one
not a big issue considering the price
google is selling those for way too much , they will not get my money for such overpriced item .
this cable is fine , except for the fact that there is no rigid construction to keep the male end from bending
i dropped my nexus <NUM> from a height of <NUM> foot onto my bed and it bent about 45
your best bet is the official nexus <NUM> charger , but beware , the usb and the cable have almost entirely seperated on the cable that came with my nexus 7 .
a big improvement from the stock cord provided with the device , liked it so much i am going to buy several more , because i take my nexus everywhere
perfect additional memory for my samsung galaxy <NUM> smart phone
easy to install and transfer data
could have not asked for anything better .
i bought <NUM> of these thinking they were somehow specially formatted for the s4
i suppose i was naive
i could have purchased the same item , for less , with the ispecial format
yes , good product and works fine the phone
special ? no .
she put it in her samsung galaxy <NUM> phone to be able to hold more pictures and data and hopefully not lose it if she breaks her phone again
now so far i have only tested it out on a computer as my tablet has still not arrived ( shipped out a week ago )
so i will update when i get to test it out on the tablet as well
it works great , a bit slow in transfer items from my computer , but that is to be expected on my old laptop , so no problems there either
<NUM> gb , only <NUM> can be used on mine , but that is still more than enough space for me , since i only plan on storing apps , and ebooks on it , along with a few movies ( maybe )
will look to buy this again if i need more room , or if my mom needs one
update : received tablet today , and popped this in , works great , reads really fast ! great for holding my books , movies , and apps that i don not want taking space on the tablet .
my last memory card for my galaxy s4 got some water damage on a camping trip a few months ago , which became apparent when all my photos became inaccessible/got deleted
i needed a fairly large and reliable memory card to replace it
i have had this microsd card for a few months now , and it has been great ! i highly recommend this to anyone looking for a reliable way to store data , especially photos on the galaxy s4 .
i bought this for my son is gopro and it is worked out great
i just wish i would have bought the 64gb instead of going cheap on the 32gb , but so far so good
he is a couple of months into using his camera with this card and no issues .
purchased this after the purchase of a camcorder that required it and would not work with a 16gig
got the smaller card at local store because of price and wanted to compare amazon first
haft the price of buying it local so was worth the wait
was in my hands a few days after ordering and would recommend that one at least look here before paying the box store price .
this card is very good
i use it in my gopro because that need a fast writing and reading
i recommend it .
i needed a class <NUM> card for my gopro and this one looked like the best deal for the size , and i have always liked the sandisk brand .
the micro sd card worked with no problem whatsoever
the adapter that came with it did not work at all
luckily i had an extra .
this card works well with my gopro
lots of storage space in a small package
the price was fair for a sandisk product .
bought this for my new gopro and away we go
great sd card at a great price
love it love it love it .
i liked it
i is already formatted and no need for formatting it
my galaxy s4 recognized it easily and easy to use
the only reason i gave <NUM> star because it is not 32g as stated and it is only 29g
i don not know if that is supposed to be or not
i am happy anyway and would recommend this sd card to every body
you won not never regret .
very high quality and what a deal ! fast shipping
i trippled the memory on my galaxy s4 for only $22
90 ship
anyway now i can have all my music and videos and pictures on my new external memory and my phone runs great
i have the samsung galaxy gear watch so i needed more room to install programs for the gear
awesome deal !
this is oem from kingston
i have had other data storage items from them
all good
this one , too
have not used the adapter .
bought this since it said it was specifically formatted for the galaxy s4 , and for the first <NUM> months it was working fine
bought it to replace a sandisk 64gb microsdhc card that was prone to have problems
after approx <NUM> months , the card stopped reading in the phone
i tried other cards and they worked in the phone
the kingston microsdhc card was dead and will not even read in my laptop or desktop computer , using different sd card readers
i can not format it , can not even read it in the disk management viewer , and can not do anything with the card now
thousands of pictures and videos are now lost and that doesn not make me happy at all
junk card
fyi , i put the 64gb sandisk card back in and that is been working great ever since .
this is a good , inexpensive option for my camera
it works perfectly
amazon sells it for less
kingston is a reliable brand .
i finally have more than enough storage on my phone
more than i will probably ever need ! if others are like me , they save zillions of graphics , apps , pictures , videos , etc
and the constant warnings on my screen that i am almost out of room drive me crazy ! ; ) so
as much as i can , i add to my sd card & voila ! no more warnings
even after all that i have in there , i still have between of room open
i don not think i will ever be able to use it all up lol
shipper was fast & the price was not too bad
so glad i ordered this card ! : )
slipped right into my galaxy 4s and was able to transfer all media from my previous card to this one
allows me to use my phone without worrying about running out of storage .
fast delivery
works as described and does the job
kingston reputation was final decision maker
would buy again
using with samsung galaxy s4 .
i used it for my galaxy s4 for a good <NUM> months without any problems
and just today
it is died
won not work at all , can not recover any files , can not even format it to it
it is now a worthless tiny chip
thanks , kingston
won not be using this product again
any one else who plans on using this for a phone , especially a samsung , i would recommend you buy samsung is brand for the sd card
i should have done that from the start , but i wasn not even aware they made an sd card brand at the time
( i should have known
samsung makes everything ! )
i bought the <NUM> gig
card for just that purpose , my samsung phone , takes as good pictures as most cameras
in fact i like the camera feature better than all the other stuff on the
i would buy it again and again if i needed a lot of memory
i recommend this item to anyone who has run out of memory for pictures or any thing that needs to be stored out from the internal memory of the camera
i like to take moving photos with my samsung , and those <NUM> second runs take a lot of memory , now i don not have to worry and running out of memory
we bought two of these micro cards for my wife is new samsung galaxy <NUM> cell phone since she takes a lot of pictures and we wanted a second micro card for backup
all i can say is that the card works well in the samsung cell phone .
fit inthe phone and worked fine
it is tough to get enthusiastic about memory except as one ages and loses theirs .
nice pack
installed easily in my galaxy s4
works great
instead of paying $100 for a 32gb phone get a 16gb phone and add the sd card .
ordered this to leave connected to an hdmi port on the upstairs tv so my wife could connect her tablet to the tv
it works great and appears well made and should last a long time , especially where only the connector will the inserted and removed multiple times
no issues with it being loose , weak , or ready to break
hard to beat the price with a nominal shipping charge
it arrived in its own bag inside of a shipping bag in perfect condition , and the shipping was exactly when they said it would be .
digital works or it doesn not ( despite monster cable is hooey )
this works and the price is right .
this cable for under $7 was every bit as good as the ones sold in camera stores for $40+ dollars
i am very happy with my purchase .
the cable works as advertised and the price is unbeatable
i am not using it for a camcorder but for a canon elph camera with hdmi out
the photos and videos look great
bought this hoping it would be as good as the $20 one at staples
for the price
why not try it ? works great
no graininess
no interruption of transmission
perfect length for my purposes
they must have just had an abundance and wanted to get rid of them because they are top quality .
just to give you a brief history , i had contacted citi electronics before buying this product , if it is going to be compatible with my canon hf200 video camera
their response ; yes
considering how much the original one costs , i went the cheaper route ; and it bit me right back
this cable does not work
citi electronics lied ( just another california bases electronics retailer selling chinese junk )
now , they expect me to pay for shipping even if the product is defective
wonder if amazon even goes through a selection process anymore
overall , a very very bad experience
never buying anything from citi electronics again
will have to buy original canon cable
there should be a way of actually making it zero star .
i needed an hdmi cable to connect my camcorder to the flat screen tv
did not wanted to hassle and see it on rca cables
cables work and were cheap .
prompt shipping
on time delivery
excellent quality cable
tested using my canon sx <NUM> and it worked really well for images and for video
good buy and great price .
what pay $50 for a canon brand cable when you can get this one for under $10 and the quality is just as good
i highly recommend this mini hdmi cable .
this cable lets me show pictures and videos from my camera through my tv monitor
easy to use
clean picture
it does what it is supposed to do .
we use this cable to hook our camera to the rv tv
works well and is long enough to be able to see at a table and operate the device
the photos look nice on a large screen .
can view my pictures right from my cannon 4ti on my big screen tv with this
it works great , but be sure to follow cannon is directions
you must have the cable connected and have the tv on before turning on the camera
it is great to look at the pictures on the big screen before downloading them so you can pick the good pictures .
and i like the length
makes it much easier to make the connection between the cfamera and the tv
my tv is mounted high on the wall , so length is essential if the camera is not to be dangling
i haven not yet used the cable , but it appears to be strong and flexible .
this hdmi cable is perfect for sending image and video from my digital camera to my hdtv
being told that it isn not necessary to spend outrageous money on hdmi cable has proven true
i now have several inexpensive hdmi cables that work perfectly
i would purchase additional cables from this seller in the future .
works flawlessly to connect my new canon camera to all the hd tvs that i have hooked it to
great pics and vids and sound .
works just like my shorter cables only with more optional length
a good price for adding distance flexibility for camera to tv hookup when viewing pictures .
i bought this to use with my canon g10 camera
the canon version costs about $40
this one works perfectly
no reason to pay a penny more .
the cable is doing just what it is suppose to do
the connectors fit snuggly into the hdmi input on the tv and the output of my canon 5d , mark ii
saved a lot of money vs
the cable offered by canon .
just what i wanted to review photos on my camera via my hd tv
i can sit across the room from the tv and get an excellent view .
works great to connect my canon 60d or t5i camera to an hd tv
i directly connected it to two of my tv is and it works perfectly
when i connected it to a <NUM> port hdmi switch , it did not work
the price is great .
this cable does work with my 5d mark iii and my canon point and shoot
audio seems a little off
not sure if it is the cable or not
i mean it does not sound as crisp as listen direct from card and from computer
no more thought is given to that .
i found a tiny hdmi jack on my the canon powershot and found no one had one locally and special order- i needed to take out a loan
this cable worked perfectly , no issues
now my still camera can output full hd video/audio
signal delivered without errors to monitor
<NUM> feet is a good length for getting around to the back of monitors or wall mounts .
the cable itself is very flimsy compared to the oem canon
seems to work ok so represents exceptional value for money .
very good and normal quality
you can use it instead of originals
suitable for canon sx40hs
i haven not more words but the site required more words so i wrote that ; )
simple accessory
made well , good price , and the length is enough to give you access to a system from a table and run it across the floor
clean audio and video
good purchase .
this was an error , however i shall keep it for a possible use , i find that the layman is description of the plug ids are lacking
i chose this one because it was the cheapest , under <NUM> dollars
i tested it today on my ge video recorder and used to to connect to my lcd tv is hdmi port
the mini hdmi end went in the camera and the large end in the tv
it worked fine
i will just leave it plugged into my hdmi port <NUM> all the time , so i will be able to hook up the camera to it for big screen viewing whenever needed .
very good , working just as i wanted , plugged to my t2i , this is just what i was looking for .
as everyone should know , any hdmi cable should be the same besides a few minor differences in version so i bought this cheap hdmi cable rather than expensive lies at retail stores , etc
i have to say that i am very satisfied with this product
you get a long cable that you can connect your tablet to your tv and still have the tablet not too far from you
the sound and video works perfectly
i haven not tested anything hd yet like 1080p movies but i am sure it would work
so i would recommend you buy this if you want an affordable to hdmi cable that works and is long .
plug n play
resolution was awesome
cord was nice quality did not feel like it was cheap
now i can take the camera and cable anywhere and plug it in .
premium canon mini hdmi cable is a great fits for my canon camera
it is good low prices for a long 10ft cable
i recommend it .
its awsoooooooooome , i connect it with samsung led and the picture is craaaaazy `mashallah` , i`m very happy becouse this produce
just forgo the aftermarket cables for this
the form and fit are , but the canon cable is both durable and made so that using it doesn not block off any other ports .
glad this is available and at a decent price
so many cables are overpriced just because the seller can get more for it .
i bought this so i can show video clips taken with my canon eos digital slr on my flat screen tv
works great .
this cable has good construction and works well with my canon 7d to watch movies from the cf card on the camera to the panasonic plasma hdtv
a great price for quality and this particular kind of cable .
i have a canon power shot sx20is
the mini plug of this cable fits the receptacle of the sx20is perfectly
great buy at a great price !
premium canon mini hdmi cable is a very good product for the price
so far it is working very well for me
this is a nice cable for a good price
it works well with my canon 300hs point and shoot camera , fits well and delivers a good picture
sent to me in nice packaging on time .
given the prices of hdmi cables these days , what a pleasant surprise to buy this very functional , fully operational cable for such a great price
it works
it is long
perfect .
great producct , great price , and very happy with it ! we used it with my wifes canon t3i and it was nice to see the pics on our 55&<HASHTAG> ; lcd .
this cable is <NUM> feet long and at that length i doubt you'd need anything longer
it connects to my tv well and the audio and video comes through perfectly
this hdmi cable works just fine
the price is so much lower than local retail stores
i recommend the site .
i have this slot in my canon 60d which states it is for a hdmi cable that can be hooked up to a hdtv
it is supposed to provide a sharper picture so i thought i would get one
canon wants $50+ for the cable - no thanks
on amazon i found a cable for less than $4
00 - can you believe that ? it works great
sorry , canon , but i have found the price of all your accessories way out of line .
cable works looks just as any one you would find in retail store for <NUM> times the price don not hesitate to buy .
it is not thin and light
you can put it in your camera bag , so it is very portable
the pictures from my camera look awesome on my big tv
i am hesitant to give it <NUM> stars , because the first time i tried using it , it did not work
i had to pull it in and out of the camera a few time for it to actually work .
this cable works well with my t3i , this best thing is that it is 10ft
long so you don not have to be right next to your tv to review your photos and video .
very easy for my father to use on his tablet
literally , plug it in to an hdtv and it shows the image on both the tablet and the tv
as simple as that
no need to mess with any settings
cost under $4
00 shipped and works just as good as hdmi 6'length i paid $25
00 at best buy
no complaints here
now i have a 10' so i can connect to the tv and still reach my lazyboy .
what can you say about a cheap cable ? it works well and doesn not break the bank
comes with end protectors
i did not have any problems with using this to display the hd output from my camera to a large screen .
the price seems to reflect the product here unfortunately
i bought this to be used during a short film production
it worked about <PERCENT> of the time
it would either drop out or give a distorted image to the monitor
haven not tested on other monitor as we were to busy working , but this cable negatively affected my production having to wait to start rolling as we didn not have an image
i will like be returning this product
you get what you pay for .
works great
i lost the original and this one is perfect for my needs
without it my camera is useless .
these cables are good
not top of the line
however , they do get the job done and seem to work well with my dslr .
perfect mini hdmi and it is a real bargain ! there are some hdmi cables that have a very high price range , but this one has a really low price and it works great ! i am using this cable on my canon 600d/rebel t3i
the t3i takes <NUM> mega pixel pictures and i can now see them on my hdtv
i played back hd video on it to and there was no lag what so ever
personally , this cable seems to do just as great as those other more expensive brand cables
i would recommend this mini hdmi if you are going to be using it for your dslr camera
1080p capable ! i hope this review helped you out .
i ordered this cable to use with my ainol novo7 elf ii
the cable was 10' as described and produces a flicker free , clear 1080p image
mine has rounded edges where the connectors meet the cable .
no problems running from computer to monitor , great value compared to other options and seems to be holding up just fine .
cable is great
allows me to bridge tv to pc and watch the pictures taken in travel
this past year
for a low price
very stable for tablet to tv
love it
pricing is best out there
ordering <NUM> more
absolutely love this for the price and function .
ordered this little package for some real connecting , came fast enough for me to say
hav'nt got the rest of my order to perform my yet , so being fast did'nt work for me this time ( lol ) thanks for the fast service .
nice , economic hdmi cable
i got it for my mom to use with her new tablet
so she can connect it to the tv if she ever wants
it works just great
nice and long cable
i was surprised how thin the cable was , but everything works fine with connecting her asus transformer to her led and lcd tvs .
this cable is pretty long at 10feet
there are gold plated connectors on either end
i am able to control my camera with the tv remote via hdmi
so , why spend more money than you have to ?
worked great , no issues
i didn not realize it was 10' wanted a 6' but that was my fault
cant beat the price
the cable works as it is described , it is thinner then some other brand cables like belkin etc
can not beat the price .
although the name of the item is "premium canon mini hdmi cable ( 10 ft ) " it is definitely not from canon
for the price i had my doubts that it ever was , but it does work and still looks to be a quality cable
only <NUM> stars as the description is misleading .
i bought this for my tablet that has a mini hdmi port it works is excellent with my tablet the lengthily cable helps so that you can still control your tablet and this would be good for any other mini hdmi application you desire i definitely would recommend this product
i already used this on my recorder
i got this at the right price
everything here is reasonable and a person can not go wrong .
arrived on time and as described
plugged directly from my canon dslr to my tv
pictures were clear and bright
great price when i combined this purchase with other cables i needed .
if you have a canon camera with a port suitable for connecting to this cable
but this now
for just a few dollars , you can enjoy hd pictures and video on your hd television
cable is nice and long for easy use with the tv
i would recommend to anyone .
this 10' cable works great with my canon t2i and my lcd tv
leaves plenty of room to reach the input on the tv and step back to enjoy the pictures
picture quality on my 46" tv is amazing compared to the rca video cord that is included with the camera .
wonderful deal on a good length cable with no adapters required
i use this frequently for previewing on large screens , works like a charm .
i used this to connect an older nvidia gtx460 video card in a pc with a low clearance backplate port to me av receiver on a home theater system
cable worked perfectly with no issues !
the cable arrived quickly , and is well made with gold connectors
this conversion of one smaller than the other also will fit most digital devices ( ie ) android tablets , digital cameras , cellphones etc
it seems to work ok to connect my tv with a canon dslr
this cable made it possible to connect my tablet to my big flat screen , so i could see videos better
perfect length ! sturdy , and works as good as any other major brands out there
it is the best bang for the buck !
does what it supposed to and so far no problems
length is good too as i don not have to be right in front of the tv .
all the new graphics card seem to be going to or displayport , i hooked this up from my pc to my <NUM> inch lcd hdtv and it works great , the display is fabulous ! playing games like starcraft <NUM> is just awesome .
i bought this for my tablet ( ainol novo 7a ) which features mini hdmi out and the ability to play really high bitrate content , and 3d bluray rips
i liked this cable because of the small profile at the mini hdmi end and i figured the thin cable would provide less strain on the tablet is port
cutting to the chase - i'd get flicker on certain scenes during movie playback
always the same scenes , at the exact same time - so it wasn not a fit issue
but the scenes played perfectly when i switched back to my old adapter and cable
also - i found i wasn not able to play big ( 20 gig+ ) 3d rips , when the other cable could
for most tablets and cameras this cable will work fine
i suspect this cable will be fine for the tegra <NUM> tablets ( original transformer , galaxy tab , acer iconia , etc
) since playback is generally limited to 720p
but if you play high quality video - it could be a problem - i don not know what the actual limitation is .
note : this is an adapter to go from full size hdmi to mini hdmi , this is for digital cameras and other equipment with mini hdmi
this is not for cell phones and tablets that have micro hdmi adapters like the htc evo , motorolla droid , nexus 10 , etc
not much to say here , it works just as i expect it to work on any digital camera i have used
plug it in and you are ready to view files on the big screen !
works fine when i use it to connect my android tablet to tv
only used it 6or7 times but happy for now .
canon wanted $70 for a similar cable , but i bought this cable for my canon rebel t1 digital slr at this remarkable price
the cable is spectacular and my images and videos are very clear
the standard analog cable that was included with the rebel is disappointing and there is a night and day difference between a digital signal and an analog signal
i am very pleased with my purchase .
i bought this for my 7d , it good , material seems ok , bit cheap , but it works
but i think it is still a bit expensive compared to same cables from monoprice
the thing is that i discovered that having a converter from mini and regular hdmi and a cable works better for me .
i ordered this as "sold by cable matters , fulfilled by amazon" because of the prime shipment and having received defective products from eforcity previously
for less than five bucks for a 10' hdmi , as long as it works i am happy
oddly , if you go to the cable matters store , they have one for a few cents more with a different photo
i received one that looks a bit different from that photo and the one on this listing
the one received has very plastic around the connectors rather than the rounded sides shown
it arrived in two days and fits my lumix
photos and video look great on my flat screen tv
so it does what i want , but appears a bit different from the photo .
i bought this exclusively to use withcanon eos 60dand i happy to report that this cable works flawlessly with this camera
i was initially concerned about the quality based on the price it is been offered and also was worried that the extra length ( 10 ft ) would be an issue when it comes to signal degradation etc ; but as the cable is of good quality i did not notice any sync issues or signal degradation
having the extra length allowed me to keep the camera close to me on the couch and view the breath taking pictures and 1080p videos that thecanon eos 60dis capable of
it is a nice cable very good purchase ! highly recommended ! - get one to use with any device that has a mini hdmi interface .
tested this out to connect a mk808 android stick to my panasonic plasma tv
works fine , no problems i could tell .
plugged in my tablet - works fine
i haven not tested it on my dslrs , but i am sure those work fine too .
this hdmi cable got shipped the same day i ordered it
i was thinking it would work from my canon slr to my laptop to view photos after i shoot them , but it doesn not
i have a small lcd screen i use , and it works perfect .
i bought this for the convenience of hooking up the hdmi port on my canon camera to my hdmi tv
the length is just enough to sit back and scroll through your pictures ( back and forth ) at your own speed
plugging the memory stick into the tv works as well ; but you are stuck using the tv is slide show or other program to view .
this mini hdmi cable works great when connecting it to my digital camera
i could view my photos in hd with my large screen hdtv .
i got this to connect my canon 7d to the tv
i like the low price and the quality of picture i get on tv but the cable is a bit hard to windup for storing in the bag
i wish the rubber compound used to make the cable is a bit softer to handle .
this cable has simple small ends , not overly flexible or stiff
great value for the dollar
you can purchase with confidence .
does what it says
very reasonably priced
i use this cable for my canon 5d mkii with various monitors and televisions .
what can i say - it works at a fraction of the price canon wants
i would buy again
prompt delivery
useful product to review photos on hdtv .
i needed a to hdmi cable to hook up my computer to my tv
this is exactly what i needed
it works without any problems , and i have had it for awhile ; and moved my pc / tv many times
good durability .
it works great , for a canon mini type slr , detected the camera and samsung tv with no problems , great price .
needed it so i can watch my recordings on the big screen instead of having to transfer the files on my computer all the time
basically just got it to share fast and it does the job .
at the price i paid for this
using two--one as a and the other as a cord , and have had zero problems with either of them to date .
i needed this cable to connect my epson project to my laptop
works great and the price made it a no brainer purchase .
you can buy this 10foot cable for such a great price ? the length is great
it allows you to sit on the couch or recliner and view your photos and videos in comfort
i recommend this cable .
got this to connect my <NUM> ti to my tv , and it works perfectly
audio and video are both delivered fine
it is good length , too
not sure what else you could want from a cable
i suppose it is a little loose in the 550 , but i am not sure if that is the cable or the graphics card itself
anyhow , let me know if you have any questions , i will try to answer them !
this cable works well for connecting our camcorder directly to the tv
it is long enough to allow me to sit a comfortable distance from the tv while using the controls on my camcorder
the connectors on the ends are not bulky , and the cable is not unnecessarily stiff
i can coil it up small enough to tuck into the camera bag while we are on the go
we will see how long it lasts , but it is working great for now .
a cable runs lifetime
excellent product that is no longer wearing and giving good care never going to hurt you
product <NUM> percent recommended
quality of connection and video seems good with my fujifilm f550exr camera connected to my hdtv
<NUM> foot of cable really helps so i can sit comfortably in front of the tv at a little distance and manipulate the camera .
what is there to say ? i needed a cable to run from the camera to my tv and this is what was needed
it works as expected , and allows me to view my videos and pictures that are on my camera directly on my television .
i can find nothing wrong with this cable
it works perfectly and has a great price
i do not understand why the hdmi cables are so expensive at the brick and mortar stores .
works perfectly at 1080p hd and in all other canon eos 7d modes
costs less than 1/4 the price of the canon equivalent
expensive "high end" cables are a scam
it would be crazy to pay more
tip : if you have never tried displaying your hd video or stills on an hd tv through an hdmi input , you will be shocked by the magnificent quality
absolutely no comparison to the lousy pictures you got with the old analog inputs .
i was looking for a light weight cable to go from a small video camera to a hdmi video capture card in the computer
used two of these cables on two jvc camcorders , and they did not transmit a usable signal to a video card in the computer
changed to a cable that worked fine
i plan to try it with a canon camcorder , but i suspect it will work no better
i will probably end up returning them .
bought this to hook up my motorola photon 4g to my <NUM> inch tv
worked like a charm
you cant beat the price too
all in all , its a good product to have if your internet is down and you want to stream hdmi from your phone/device to your tv like netflix etc .
on many cars the electric outlets turn off after a period of time when the car is turned off
so , if you want to charge from an electric outlet you need this charger
works well and fast .
i like to know that when i need a device i can use it when i feel like so the need to have it ready and going made me get this at home charger for my garmin
now i can go and around on foot and know that where there is an outlet i can charge up again and go
this appears to be a generic charger , not specifically designed for the garmin nuvi <NUM> gps , at least i could find no data with the charger that tied it to this gps
i decided no to use the charger on my gps for fear i may damage it
to return it would cost more in shipping than the charger is worth .
this product is of sturdy construction
works well with the garmin , and you can not beat the low price of this vender .
he used it a few weeks and it didn not work after that
he had to return it and they sent him another one
as far as i know , this one is working fine
i know initially he enjoyed using it .
i use a car charger more than i use the wall charger , but the wall charger comes in handy at the house
i bought this ac charger for my gps so that i could charge it in the house when i get home from a trip instead of leaving it in the car to charge
i would recomend this to anyone .
what can i say
it does the job with no problems
actually , since i use my garmin a lot in my car , it keeps a charge without having to charge it at home .
the price was certainly right ! however , at any price , the product was worthless
the adapter size was ok and the cord was long enough
but the connector end was wrong
the shape was correct , but the size of the connector was much too small and would not fit the gps device it was intended for , even though the amazon description was very specific that this adapter was correct for the garmin nuvi <NUM> it was bought for
since the cost was nearly nil ( other than a couple of bucks for shipping ) , i did not pursue replacement
i am still without an ac charger .
this is not a garmin charger , it is a
it works , but it not as advertised
this also doesnt matter but the light is green not red also as advertised
i didn not expect this camera to be as good as it is
takes good pictures and videos
but i am glad that i didn not buy from kodac : their price is pricey
i gave less than $100 and consider this money well spent
i would recommend this camera .
well it seemed to be working fine for about six hours , then it began discharging my gps completely
had to charge it several hours in car to get it working again .
just recieved my charger works fine ! did not understand all the negative reviews
can not beat the price
shipped on time
like hde
first of all , this product charges my garmin <NUM> very slowly
i had it plugged in using this device for <NUM> hours and it still was not fully charged
you may as well use the blackberry cell cord to charge ; it also takes this long to charge the device
the car charger will charge the <NUM> fully in about <NUM> hour
waste of my money .
these were a great addition to my gps but i wish i didn not have to buy everything seperatly but this is necessary to the gps
i bought the wall charger because i bring my garmin into the house each night
i thought it would be easier to have it charge at night for use the following day
now i don not need to use the car charger unless the battery gets low during extended use .
works as escribed
shiiping container damaged but no harm to the charger
i use it to charge my garminwhen i use it at home .
this product was ultra cheap at $3
18 however it didn not work
apparently it is possible to spend too little
you get what you pay for ! for $8
50 i purchased a plug adapter and lighter adapter that works by allowing a standard usb cord to be plugged into either
the alternate vendor is product worked well .
bottom line>doesn not work at all&lt ; >does not charge nuvi 1450&lt ; seller took my money , cause not worth returning
plug it in , turns on , turns off , no charge
can not even work on it while plugged in .
i don not use this very much , but when my nuvi has sat in my car for a few months , i will pull this baby out and let it charge overnight when i am about to take a trip
works well with no problems so far
a good buy !
wanted a spare charger to keep at home for my gps
this one works fine and gives convenience at a low price
i keep it plugged in at home to use there
the other chargers are packed in a bag with the gps for when i travel
no wondering to remember if i packed the chargers for travel or left it at home
in a pinch , should the car charger fail while traveling , i can use the other a/c charger with my inverter to keep going until i can get a replacement
the usb charger that came with the other set i bought is totally useless
i wish it had two a/c chargers instead
if i have a pc then i have a/c and would not need a usb charger
but this one was cheap enough that paying for a useless usb cable from that other company is not that big a deal .
does exactly as it is supposed to do , it charges the gps
best to leave it plugged in over night as it takes a while to do the full charge
it is designed to charge your gps , and protect the gps' battery
of course it takes longer ! works fine
i love it
'nuf said .
this product is lovely and is very good for use in my new iphones and others thing to me
at a much lower cost than many cost this does the job very well if you want to do extended work with your garmin gps away from a car , like when i was adding all my addresses to it .
it has worked well with no problems
that is the short and sweet
this sentence is added to satisfy the word count .
this unit works as advertised
not the best charger i have ever used but not the worst
it allows me to keep my garmin topped off with power prior to embarking on a trip
( could be real useful if you use your gps city feature to explore an urban landscape by foot
) all in all this unit has performed to expectations and is small enough to store with my other gps accessories .
i no longer buy any accessories for a gps ( or cell phone accessories or other tech accessories ) directly from the retail shop where i have purchased these items , as amazon offers these accessories at a much better price and the generic versions i have purchased are excellent and reliable - in this case , a charger for my garmin nuvi 1490t
very happy with my purchase
i have had the item for over <NUM> years now and it still charges perfectly
trust amazon is sellers on items like this .
the charger that came with my garmin was no longer functioning so i was pleased to find this item
it is worth buying
it was packaged securely and arrived very quickly .
i got this charger along with a garmin n&uuml ; vi 855
the charger does what it says it does , and charges the gps just fine
the only problem i have isn not really with the charger , but with the gps
when the charging through the usb port like this charger does
the gps stays powered on in "usb connected mode" the whole time
you can not turn it off , and so the screen , , and maybe the gps antenna are running while charging
thus , increasing the time needed to charge .
garmin nuvi <NUM> series standard red led wall / ac / home charger is a time and battery saver , also , the price was right
i needed it for a phone and gps battery charger
so far it is a work horse and worth the money , if you needed it of coarse .
it worked perfectly
nothing more that i could ask from a home charger
if you need one it will do the job .
it is a wall wart
it is black
it works
it looks just like the ones for my pocket camera , ipod amp , cell phone
i am going to have to start labeling these things .
i used it once
worked jus' real good
can not find it now - it is probably with the <NUM> other ac adaptors i have because the idiots in the electronics industries can not agree on one or two standard charger voltages and connector shapes
grrrr .
the thing i liked best about this charger is that one can actually use the gps while it is being charged
as you probably know , when the garmin is plugged into ones laptop via usb , it enters mode and you cannot use the device while it is being charged that way
this unit enables one to charge the device in a hotel room without the need for a laptop and allows use in order to find an expensive italian restaurant nearby
by the way , though the title says the led is red , mine was actually blue ( horrors ! ) that slight misrepresentation aside , i think this unit is well worth the investment .
i really don not have one of these wall chargers
i did buy the accessory kit for the garmin 260w , and use the usb cable attached to my desk top to charge my nuvi - for what it is worth
also , i might mention that the sandisk 2gb sd card i bought for my 260w may not serve to increase "memory" for gps garmin nuvi functions
the sd card will hold photos and recall them to display on the nuvi , but i don not know that it will service "routine" gps functions
if anyone has , knows , or gets information about this , i would like to hear about it
i conveyed this info so that people won not buy stuff that they really don not need , and expect it to do what it won not do .
it is difficult to write a specific review for this product
it either works or it don not
it works
that is what i want it to do .
very happy with it i bought this for my garmin gps it does what it should without any problems great price to
installed into my garmin <NUM> and was able to download entire map of north america
good price , quick delivery and happy customer .
i uploaded all of united states and canada via garmin and have all the space i need for my gps .
i needed more memory in order to add additional coverage for my garmin nuvi gps
this one did the trick .
this is the card that is needed to fit the rest of the maps and traffic updates onto the garmin nuvi 1450
works great .
works fine in my garmin and for a 4gb card the price is right
i would recommend it to a friend .
i bought two of these for use with two garmin nuvi <NUM> units
in my opinion , it is unfortunate that the garmin nuvi <NUM> requires extra storage capacity to handle updates ; i think they should have had at least enough storage capacity built into the original units to handle the united states and canada
i don not know yet whether i am going to need a bigger card soon to handle the updates and i don not know whether a bigger card is available .
very pleased with my purchase
i needed a ad card for my gps to download updates , maps , and fun vehicles
this works great
no problems .
i needed this card to update my maps in my garmin because there was not enough room on the garmin to fit all the new maps
this card worked fine .
i have purchased many kingston micro cards over time and have always found them reliable , fast and easy to handle
i use them on my gps , hd video camera , samsung tablet , laptops and including my desktop
i do not remember one failing me as they are totally reliable
that is important to me as i handle them a lot
back and forth from my laptop and my other electronic equipment for my music , my guitar recordings , lyrics
i have not hesitation to recommend them highly to others .
now i can install the full maps on the micro sd card ( 4 gb ) , and have the full 1
8 gb available on the gps for vehicle , voices and other extras
awesome memory
highly recommended
i have been trying to update my garmin nuvi <NUM> with the latest maps for quite some time with no success
i had a 2gb micro sd card installed in the nuvi that showed a sufficient amount of free space to allow the update , but it would never complete the download
on an off chance i ordered this micro sd and it worked perfectly the first time
i have no idea why the old card would not work , but now it doesn not matter
for the low price and free shipping , this is a great deal .
the sd card is fine
but it doesn not work with the garmin nuvi <NUM> lmt
i specifically ordered this for my gps
but it doesn not seem to be compatible with it .
got this for my garmin nuvi
i understand the original use of card was for portable devices
nevertheless , it is too small and easy to lose
now i have to lug around this slightly larger sd card to adapt it to my pc
i will probably lose it before the next time i try to update the software on the really tiny card
clunky design overall .
i bought this for my garmin nuvi ( can not remember the model number ) with lifetime map updates , a <NUM> inch screen , and live traffic updates
it works great to update the us & canada maps because you need about 1
6gb to update those !
i was having problems with my garmin nuvi 1450
i could not download map updates
this 4gb card solved the problem perfectly
it was easy to install and now i have updated my maps .
when i began updating the maps i was confronted with &<HASHTAG> ; no memory&<HASHTAG> ;
i didn not realize my garmin had a place for a sd card ! duh&<HASHTAG> ; i ordered this one because kingston is a quality company and the price was right
i am all caught up on my gps updates and assume this 4gb card will last the life of the gps and not fill up .
i was not happy that i needed a micro card for my nuvi - i get lifetime maps but nowhere to put them , lol
and the card available through garmin cost three times the price of this one ! i was happy to find this at such a great price
it arrived quickly and works great
thanks for saving my nuvi kingston ! : )
great little drive
it gave me the additional space to load more maps on my nuvi
i also use one in my wife is camera
any time i use her camera , i swap out the memory card so my pictures are not on her card
she has about <NUM> pictures on her card and uses her camera with that card as a portable photo album
this card is so inexpensive that i use one to back up her photos even though i have never had one of these cards fail .
i`m a musician and i record almost everyday
these tapes is an excelent way to check my self
very clean recordings and excelent playback
good tapes
like another reviewer here , i can verify that these tapes have too much drag in the mechanism
on my nakamichi , they frequently stop during recording or playback
it is a tension problem , wherein a high end deck will purposefully stop advancing the tape to avoid breakage ; basically , it thinks the tape is stuck
cheapo decks that do not have this feature may work fine with these tapes
i have had no problem with other , commercially available cassettes on this deck
my advice , if you have these tapes , is to run them a bit before you record to them
pop 'em in your deck and fast forward the entire tape , then rewind fully
maybe a few times
with one tape , after recording one side just fine it was stopping every <NUM> seconds no matter where i started from on the opposite side , until i performed the above
recorded audio sounds fine
i would add that these are recommended in the nakamichi owner is manual
go figure .
as the author of the jefferson airplane book "take me to a circus tent" and a former radio , i am often asked to write and or discuss various music supplies and recordings from the 60 is and 70 is
i have used thousands of maxell cassette tapes over the years and the quality has been superlative
the maxell xl2 is high bias , also known as chrome , position 2 , and cro2
they are specifically engineered for music
if you are recording rock , jazz , or classical the quality will surpass your expectations
maxell is reputation for tapes was solidified as far back as the 1970 is when the majority of the sound crews would use maxell at the mixing board for playback after a live performance
in order to get the best result it is imperative the tape deck you use has clean heads all the time
failure to keep dirt away from the internal parts will result in recordings even with first class tapes
if you are recording voice only , look for the normal bias , position <NUM> tapes by maxell
try to avoid using tapes over <NUM> minutes you will have less headaches with breakage
the <NUM> and <NUM> minutes are thinner and will tear fairly often
enjoy the music and be well , craig fentonauthor of the jefferson airplane book "take me to a circus tent"
for some reason couldn not find high bias cassette tapes around town
amazon to the rescue
no problems or complaints with this product .
this product is no longer available at j and r
you enter your information and then get to the place where it says : "place your order" and the cart goes to "0"
real drag
i called jandr twice about removing this page from amazon but they said it takes time .
let is just get past all the bs , okay ? they--as in maxell--should still be selling these
i record on them all the time and it is just so fng ridiculous that they could be discontinued , or be sold for fifty dollars
it is true , that no tape really sounds better than these , unless they were to start releasing metal tapes again , which is impossible in this market
i record lps onto these tapes , and listen to them in the car
it took me a long time to get the peaks right for recording , as in where i should average the peak decibels to record at
i eventually came to five plus , which means the bars never go above four decibels
i believe my peak levels are in line with the balance of sound , that while the directional booklet for my cassette player ( a tck670 sony ) says record at plus three , letting it go a little bit above that but average at +3 , means you are getting as much sound without breaking your eardrums
they also say to record two decibels below the distortion point , and for me that is like 7+ on a lot of stuff[some records are louder or softer than others when it comes to decibels
for instance prince sign o' the times is very loud , and i record at around five+ or below , while the smiths queen is dead , the newly remastered version , is softer , and i record at a <NUM> recording level
recording level is how much sound is filtered through the cassette player onto the recording medium , while the decibel count meter shows you how--scientifically that is--loud what you are recording really is]
now i am not gonna' say it is always pretty , sometimes there is an album like let it bleed , where the lp was put together rather shoddily , and the acoustic tracks are subzero to the rockier tracks
in such cases i have tried to record each track at the peak individually , though i haven not really heard them enough yet to know if this works
i will say that listening to these on a car stereo , well , the car stereo is a lot more sensitive than and a good sony receiver
you have to be accurate to get the best sounding tape , but the reward can be fantastic
you see , i used to listen to cds , like all through college , but then my ears started to turn negative to the extreme highs and mids
plus , you never understand the music in your brain from a cd like you do on an lp
basically i cannot barely stand to listen to digital unless i have extremely good speakers , and that is not often
so lps it is for me , but i wanted to hear them in my car , so began this whole trek to get the tapes to sound right
high bias is much more difficult to get right than normal bias , which if you listen through a good stereo , reveals all the definition of a rough sketch on paper
the high bias is pretty accurate , though someday i would wish to maybe improve the class of cassette player i have and see if i can not do even better ? oh well , right now i have a system and it works pretty well
and to think they are not putting cassette players into new cars anymore ! i rather think the record industry would not be suffering now as it is , if it had kept true to fidelity and analogue , and most importantly vinyl , which cannot hardly be digitally downloaded without gutting the sound and a lot of work ! it is what they get for years of $20 for new cds and the nightmare of sam goody
they wanted to profit by everyone buying their collections all over again , and look where it has got them ! people listen to music--if at all--as a casual thing , where they never really listen and wouldn not spend a dime for the crap they do in fact hear
the labels killed their own business by choosing the cd over the lp
but at least i can find used lps for bargain prices now , eh ? or prohibitively expensive boxsets
) :
i have found , through my experience , that maxell xlii high bias cassette tapes are highly durable , long lasting , and play back very clear sound
while high bias tapes are not the absolute best for recording from cds ( metal bias tapes are ) , they are a big step up from normal bias tapes
i have used these maxell tapes for about <NUM> years for everything from voice recordings , to sound effects , to music
about <NUM> years ago i started getting into cd burning for some of my music needs , including burning my own original music from tapes onto cd through the computer , but i still use these maxell tapes to this day for certain things
cassette tapes and tape decks are becoming more and more a thing of the past
if you still have use for them , then i highly recommend these maxell tapes .
edit : turns out there are a few companies out there that still make high end cassette tapes for recording
see the link from the commenter below , and also try musicians friend
don not buy this aged overstock overpriced junk ! we who still love the warm sound that only analog provides and are still die hard , diy recorders using analog 4tracks are forced to pay ridiculous prices for old overstock tapes from the 90s since the only brand name cassettes you can buy at a store like walgreens is a <NUM> pack cheapo maxell normal bias ( even these are being hard to come by )
this is the case with amazon and ebay - all i can find are overpriced overstock still sealed high bias cassettes for five bucks each plus shipping - neither tdk nor maxell make anymore so all we have is old leftover stock and these sellers exploit that fact
i am not sure if the cassettes lose any of their quality after a certain amount of time ( please comment if someone knows ) , but regardless , i don not recall paying these prices when they were new ! i don not know if anyone manufactures new tapes
if anyone knows , please comment
anyway , this is very discouraging
a home made tape was a labor of love and a sound you cannot get from digital
i still am a die hard analog diy recorder , and i use an <NUM> channel analog tascam 4track , one of the best models of <NUM> tracks made , using shure studio mics , and i often master to a cd burner , not a pc ( depending on what i am working with )
the tracks only become mp3s when i rip the master cd into the computer
it has become increasingly harder to do this because of this
now i use my 4track mostly to record solo recordings but i have used it to record full band demos and have been able to produce near professional quality recordings ! sublime is "robbin' in the hood" was recorded entirely on an analog 4track , as have others
doubtful , but any sellers reading this ? your year old overstock tapes aren not gold , jerks .
maxell manufactures excellent "xlii high bias" <NUM> minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording
as long as you have the right kind of equipment , these tapes record the sounds of record albums , radio shows , , people talking and more
these tapes have <NUM> minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are <NUM> blank minutes for recording on each side
record lectures , music , conversations , piano playing and more--whatever you want ! the tape playback will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your car
the tapes are extremely well made in that they do allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times ; and they take up very little room so they are easy to carry around with you
if you pay the current amazon price of $13
77 for the you spend roughly $2
75 per tape
some people will find that to be too expensive while others will want these blank cassette tapes anyway , not minding having to pay the price
unfortunately , these tapes still cannot produce <PERCENT> the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you
this means that if , hypothetically , you were to copy a onto another instead of a maxell cassette tape , the quality of the sound on the copy would be at least somewhat sharper and clearer with less background noise than these maxell cassette tapes will give you
moreover , cassette tapes can break if not handled with care
they can also break if used a few too many times , too
therefore , i recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup
these shortcomings frustrate me and therefore i will have to take off one star to make this a four star review
the tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible
if you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole
the cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording
i also agree with the gentleman who suggests that you clean the heads of the tape deck before using these cassette tapes to maximize the quality of the recording
overall , maxell xlii high bias cassette tapes makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music , the radio , people talking or anything you wish to record
i have used this brand for decades and i cannot think of any major complaints
i highly recommend maxell normal bias <NUM> minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape .
i have used maxell xlii for over two decades
i have used them on a nakamichi <NUM> cassette deck , a tandberg tcd320 cassette deck , and small recorders from sony ( with microphone )
i have used the maxell xlii tapes for recording albums from vinyl , recording from compact discs , and recording live , e
, parties , waterfalls , and my own playing using a nakamichi microphone
when i first got my nakamichi 581 , i did a test of an actual vinyl record , and my taped copy of the vinyl recording
i was not able to tell the difference
this demonstrates the high quality of the maxell xlii tape
the particular recording was a duet with max roach on drums and anthony braxton on saxophone
this recording was an especial challenge to the tape is ability to record at higher frequencies
the maxell tape passed the test , so to speak
also , i recently listened to recordings that i made in the year 1980
i have no reason to believe that the recordings on my maxell tape have deteriorated
this is another good thing about the maxell xlii tape
i have nothing bad to say about the <NUM> minute maxell xlii tape
but i do have bad things to say about tape recorders
first of all , my tandberg is a risky machine
perhaps , one time out of <NUM> times that i use the tandberg , the tape gets tangled up
i blame this on the tandberg , not on the tape
another problem is that my nakamichi <NUM> has been broken for many years , and i have not been able to find anybody who repairs this sort of machine
the nakamichi <NUM> was , and probably still is , the highest quality cassette deck known to mankind
but i can not find anybody who can fix mine
again , this is not the fault of the tape
finally , sony had an excellent little cassette player/recorder , the
the sound quality of this machine is fine for recording nature sounds and children is music concerts
however , i dropped this sony machine , and it broke , and it is not manufactured anymore
instead , sony does make a similar , newer model , but the sound quality of this sony cassette recorder is garbage ( please see my reviews of the newer sony machine )
but this is not the fault of the tape
sony standard cassette voice recorder adds a whining sound to your tapes
a similar recorder , the panasonic portable cassette recorder with slide microphone , adds a chirping sound to your tapes
the following applies only to recording nature sounds , children is marching bands , and so on
the following does not apply to making tape recordings from commercially available music on compact discs
last year , i bought a digital voice recorder , the olympus
please see my review of the olympus
the olympus is an absolute dream and a miracle -- because of the very low background noise , because of the absence of clicking sounds when starting/stopping or when pausing/restarting recordings , because of the extreme length of recordability , and because of its extremely compact size
therefore , at least for amateur recordings of nature sounds , marching bands , and parties , cassette tapes and cassette recorders might no longer be medium of choice .
i use this in my car to play mp3 is of rock , d+b , electronic and some metal and it all sounds good
convenient feature allows the cord to come out of either of <NUM> spots on the cassette so it can fit in any car and lets you control where the cord goes
no problems yet , it does as advertised and as always amazon rocks with fulfillment .
yeah , yeah , so if we are looking at these cassette adapters we already know we are not on the cutting edge of the tech world
but this is still a great way to couple audiobooks and music from my smart phone to the sound system in my ancient crate
works way better than any fm transmitter i have ever tried ( although i admit i gave up after the first one or two )
and the quality of this maxell unit is at least as good as anything else i have come up with the last few years , particularly for the price
the heads look well made ( i have seen others that were downright crude ) and the mechanism is quiet after six months' use
sound quality is certainly good enough , although my car is noisy enough that it is not a big issue
i can not discern any difference between what comes through this adapter and sound off cds in the factory player , so it is sure good enough for me
i am not an audiophile , but if i was i wouldn not be messing with cassette adapters !
how do audio cassettes load in your car is cassette deck ? do you insert them with the narrow side or the wide side ? the problem is that most cassette adaptors can not accommodate both types of cassette decks
with this maxell adaptor , that isn not a problem
the great thing about this cassette adaptor is that the audio cable that leads out of it can be configured to exit from the narrow or wide side meaning no compatibility issues
notes-----------if you are not hearing anything , try switching the audio cable to exit the cassette adaptor on the opposite side
in my rav4 , cassettes load by inserting the narrow end
but since i didn not hear any audio , i thought this adaptor was broken
it turned out that if i made the audio cable exit on the *other* narrow end of the cassette , then there was no problem
also try increasing the output volume of your ipod
tested with : ------------a <NUM> rav4 and an ipod <NUM> gig and also an ipod touch
they worked fine except for the issue mentioned above .
i drive an old car , without a cd drive
it has a cassette drive , though and i had an additional mp3player i did not use anymore , so i bought this gadget - and it works ! sound quality is surprisingly good , the basic volume could be a bit higher but otherwiese it produces a clear and rich sound
the only little annoyance is , that now a cable is sticking out of the cassette deck and hangs around the front panel
but eventually i will fix it somewhere , where it is not in the way anymore .
the cassette , as other have said , makes a clicking noise as it runs
i have it in a <NUM> rav4 oem stereo
it will also cut out when tracks change on the music player
very annoying
i would not have bought this except for the maxell name
disappointed .
i am actually a bit shocked
i have been using this cassette adapter for the past two years
the sound quality is good , although you can hear some typical cassette noise at higher volumes
the cassette adapter itself is fairly quiet as well
in cold weather , it sometimes sticks a bit
but overall , it has worked quite well
i don not leave my mp3 player in the car , so the stereo cable saw quite a bit of abuse from daily bouts of plugging and unplugging
it managed to last <NUM> years , which is excellent considering how quickly 8mm stereo cables can develop shorts .
use this to play my ipod in my nissan maxima tape player
works great and the audio is pretty good
better then radio quality but not cd quality .
it works fine and is a pretty good product
i picked this one over <NUM> other ones because it was cheaper and had okay reviews
it does the job well .
i got this several years ago so my daughter could listen to her ipod through the family car radio which does not have an aux input
it does not provide super fidelity but such a device can not ever be compared to a direct connection
it works good ( certainly met my expectation ) and it still gets used occasionally to play mp3s from my phone .
i purchased this to listen to podcasts off my blackberry curve <NUM> ( sprint )
i have found that the sound quality varies from podcast to podcast due to the level of compression used
generally i turn my blackberry up to full volume and almost do the same in my car stereo
the sound quality is ok - it is a cassette after all
the cord is not very thick so you need to be careful not to snap it or pull on it roughly
i might try another adapter to see if there is any difference in sound quality
also , the dolby noise reduction is a must , otherwise you will get a lot of hissing
i would say overall the purchase was positive , perhaps my expectations were a bit too high .
so i just got an ipod 4gb from amazon and was dying to play it in my ride
unintentioanlly i saw this in a friend is car and i did some research and a week later it is in my hands
well , i have to say this is an impressive tape adaptor
the sound quality is just as good as playing a cd and the stereo in my car reads it smoothly
on top of that , it is inexpensive ! so if you are looking for a tape adapto for your ipod , you should get this one ! : )
my other adapter was taken from my car so i needed a replacement
i am satisfied with this one
it does the job well ! i am glad i bought it
: )
folks let me be honest , i ran through several loops till i put the money on this adapter ! 1
i tried several in car radio wave adapters in car radio listing to my ipod video ( all of them are crap ! ) i wasted 70bucks ) 2
i tried several no brand cassette adapters ( crap ! i wasted like <NUM> bucks on no name version ) i say if u are an audiophile in your car and your ipod is a must everyday , get this maxell adapter ! its the only one i found to work fantastically on a lexus gs300 and a honda and a merc and toyota factory installed players
this stuff i think has improved over the years
i don not hear any hissing even during classical performances !
this works perfect for hooking up my phone to my old tape player in the car
the cord is probably <NUM> feet so plenty of room to move and it seems to be quality
mine does make a slight clicking sound when playing but this could be caused by the car tape player and not he adapter .
this works great and saved me $$$$ that a newer vehicle would have cost
plug it in and listen to whatever you have got on your phone or access stations through your phone
it is fun to listen to foreign stations , etc .
i ordered this after much searching
i ordered this one to go in my toyota sienna <NUM> which has a cassette deck
i chose this brand because i trust it more than the cheaper ones
it plays good through my car stereo
the sound is good enough , not as great as when you have earphones on , but nothing will sound that good when you are in a car anyway
so far i am satisfied with it .
works fine
the only caveat is that you may need to manually switch the end where the cable comes out to match the direction of your cassette player
when used as configured my player rejected it until i changed the end the cable came out
i would have preferred a product that did not require configuration .
i bought this to replace my old sony tape adapter i have had since the discman days
that one worked great until my car ( acura tl ) decided to start doing the deal and constantly spit it out
being the cheapo that i am , i wanted to find another tape adapter instead of getting an audio input installed in my car , and i was hopeful when i saw the reviews on this adapter
however , this product constantly clicks , and loud enough to distract me from the music playing
also the quality on this adapter is much worse than my old sony adapter
there is a lot of white noise , and i have to crank up the volume on both my ipod and my car speakers to get it to a volume where i can actually hear the lyrics of the songs
i have tried fiddling with the wire , moving it in different positions , and pulling the wire straight , but it doesn not help
i have rendered the adapter pretty much useless , and for now am stuck listening to the radio until i decide to suck it up and stop being cheap about installing an audio jack in my car .
has a little hum , but the highs are crystal clear
sounds as good as cd .
works great
it is excellent quality
i use it for my mp3 player in my car , and the sound quality exceeds the ones i have used in the past
i had a couple ones from radio shack before this one that didn not hold up for very long , and broke after a short while
the problem area with other one is where the cord connects to the tape and on the other end of the cord where it connects to your audio player
this cassette adapter uses a much more durable cord , which gives it better reliability and sound quality
i have had no problems whatsoever with this unit and would recommend it to anyone
i have a discerning ear for sound quality , and this exceeds all other units i have tried
update : i lost my old one when i got a new car , and liked it so much i got another to replace the old one
i had the old one for without any issues .
i use this in my older model truck to listen to my ipod
i have used different fm transmitters in the past and was never really happy with the sound quality
this is the way to go
i wish i had tried it before !
i was force to buy this since the one that came with my sony portable cd player and my cassette player in my car didn not get along ! i had one of these for years but time got the best of it
so if i have to get another one , this was my only choice since it works without any drama !
arrived on time
was brand new as described
i like this product because it brings out a little more bass in the sound
this is actually the first stereo cassette adapter i have seen that has an extra bass feature
i recommend it very highly .
works but got rid of it because of the loud mechanical sounds from the internal gears -- squeaking , grinding , crunching sounds
much worse than my previous maxell adapter
poor manufacturing ! ordered the philips usa cd/mp3/ adapter for which the amazon reviews about noise are much better ( and it is a buck cheaper to boot )
indeed , the philips was very good
buy it
don not buy the maxell
you will be happier
update to review : about a year after purchase , the philips is making louder and louder noises
i guess noise is endemic to these adapters .
we got this player because another brand would not work in my husband is taurus
it kept giving us an error message and he could not use it with his ipod
this one does not have the same problems
it works every time
we are very happy .
love these adaptors ! i got this one mainly for my car
since it has a combo cd/cassette deck ( which is awesome ) this little gem does the trick
i use this to play my mp3 players ( sony and an ipod ) the audio quality is superb
its crystal clear
i also use this in the house on my stereo system
this is a great buy ! and its worth it to have a few of these on hand
you never know when youll need one .
works well , purchased as a replacement for another that just wore out over time
sound quality is very good with no sounds or squeaks from the cassette player .
i was really surprised at how good the sound quality is with this unit
my old adapter distorted if turned up to loud at the source , but not this one .
this thing works great
being able to move the cord around is very handy when using this in various places
i use it in my car & home stereo & the sound quality is very close to a cd
there is not very much "airy" sounding feedback either
make sure to turn the volume all the way up on the device so it will sound the best
i love being able to plug in my android phone & stream things from the internet through my car stereo ! i highly recommend this if you are considering one of these .
i did a lot of investigating before buying this product
i ended up buying it mainly because it was the only one with decent reviews that i could find in stores
however , i am not disappointed at all
the sound isn not quite cd quality but it is pretty darn good and definitely better than a regular tape
i don not have an fm adapter but from what i read , the cassette adapters have a much better sound
the other big bonus is that it doesn not matter which way the larger opening is on your tape deck because this adapter has a latch you can open on the bottom to change the cord over to the other side if needed
warning , some brand name adapters will only work in tape players facing a certain direction ! every once in a while i have to put the tape in twice for it to work right ; otherwise i haven not had any other problems with this and it gives my mp3 player a great sound ! another tip : if you don not have an equalizer on your car stereo or mp3 player , what you can do is adjust the volume on the player and your stereo to balance the bass and treble ( for me , if i have the mp3 player sound lower and the car stereo louder , i will have more treble
and a little more static , too )
as an aside , i doubt the product itself was the problem for the person with the bad car speakers who reviewed this product negatively .
after ordering and returning the coby brand version , which did not work at all , i am pleased to report this one works fine
i bought it to play tunes from my sandisk mp3 player on my car cassette deck , and this unit fits the bill nicely !
i was pretty skeptical that this item would produce acceptable output through my honda is cassette player when connected to a sansa fuze
however , i was pleasantly surprised -- not only that the sound was acceptable , but it is actually quite good ! as a professional midi musician , i am pretty demanding in what i consider "good" ; this maxell adapter far exceeds what i was expecting from this type of technology
i understand that there are going to be numerous variables in play with what every consumer can expect in the way of sound quality
probably the largest factor is going to be the quality of the cassette deck that will be using the device , specifically , the playback heads
the results weren not quite as impressive in one of my cassette decks , though still good
another very important factor is the quality of the mp3 is being played ; the better the playback device , the more readily you will hear the shortcomings of a mp3 or other digital file
after all , some people are happy with <NUM> kbps mp3 is ( which are pretty low quality to begin with ) and none of my mp3 is are less than <NUM> kbps
even those i have purchased from amazon
overall , i am very happy with this device and consider it a very good , inexpensive alternative to having a dedicated line in/line out option like those you find on newer decks
near , to be sure .
this works great
it shouldn not be that difficult and it isn not
we used it to connect an ipod to my wife is car stereo
the sound is just fine--much better than an fm transmitter we used in the past .
it works
it wasn not expensive
what more can you ask for ? only use it for the car
and so for <NUM> bucks it represents the cheapest way to wire my pod .
i have a single cd plyer in my <NUM> car
never cleaned the lens the entire time i own it
lately it is been scratching my cds , and frequently not playing them
put this lens cleaner in
at first it wasn not doing anything , but the cd player just spit the cd right out
apparently the lens is really dirty
after a couple times of putting the cd back in i heard instruction in track <NUM> saying that tract <NUM> only needs to be played the minimum of <NUM> seconds to get the lense cleaned
my player required <NUM> playings of full tract <NUM> to function properly again
when i took the lens cleaner out , i see a lot of dust on the little brush , and on the bottom surface of the disk ( picked up by static ? )
i think it has done its job , and now the cd player is playing my music again .
this makes it easy to clean your cd player
it tells you what to do when you play it and is not liquid based
good cleaner and for dirtier lenses , make sure you use a few times to get it good
always good to have one of these around .
this arrived in only two days so i popped it in on the way to pick up the kiddos
this directions are on the disc and really simple
the cd makes an annoying beeping sounds while cleaning ( i turned the radio down and kept checking for it to finish ) but that is my only dislike
the packaging was very study
i will definitely buy from this seller again .
my <NUM> pontiac montana is cd player started acting up a few months ago
almost every time i put a cd in , the player would spit it back out and the display would say "check cd
" after <NUM> or <NUM> tries , the player would finally accept the cd
but it sure was frustrating
so i stopped at the dealership and inquired about this problem
the first thing the service advisor suggested was to try a cd lens cleaner
i had never used one of these in my life
and i have had cd players since 1984
but when i went to my is house for thanksgiving , he had just purchased this same identical cd lens cleaner at the local meijer store
i asked him if i could try it out in my car is cd player and he gladly obliged
well , after one cleaning , so far the cd player hasn not rejected any of my cds
and we drove back home after thanksgiving
almost <NUM> miles
and played many cds
so , for now at least , i am convinced
i came right home and ordered this maxell cd lens cleaner for myself
i don not know if i'd feel comfortable enough to try it in my mac desktop or powerbook
but i think i'd feel safe using it in my sony cd player or playstation
in fact , the ps2 will be the first device to get cleaned when this arrives
it is been rejecting discs , too
maybe the lens is just gunked up with dust
it fixed my car cd player trouble and saved me a lot of money that the dealership would have charged me to service the darn thing
i'd recommend it highly .
did not resolve the issue with my car dvd drive
when i put it in the drive ejected it as it did with dvds
i beleive it is ok
just haven not tried it in any other dvd drives i have .
i am unsure of the benefit of using this cd lens cleaner
it may have solved the problem of a dirty/dusty lens , but it may not have , as the problem on one cd player was only temporarily resolved
another cd player that otherwise worked fine could not recognize this disc at all , and on all of my players that did , it could not advance to the third track , which contains only music
significant skipping was noticed on all cd players , including those that never skip on other discs
if nothing else , this cleaner may provide a superficial and temporary fix , but if your cd player is lens needs cleaning , there are likely better and more effective ways of solving the problem .
i don not know why i purchased it
i don not even understand how its supposed to work anyway
mawell makes cheap products anyway
pretty sure you can find it in the dollar store .
after trying the memorex lens cleaner obtained from wal mart and returning it because neither of my computers' cd/dvd drives recognized it , i bought this product [the maxell ] from amazon
shipping via prime was rapid and arrival was in excellent condition
the product works just fine* thus hardening my position/opinion that maxell products are of good quality and memorex products are of lower quality
* my computer is drive can now burn a music cd at full speed and make a product which is playable on the same drive
before cleaning , i had to reduce writing speed from &<HASHTAG> ; fastest&<HASHTAG> ; to &<HASHTAG> ; medium&<HASHTAG> ; to burn readable disks .
the product is not recommended for note book optical drives , but i used it anyways and it seemed to work .
hey , i am a music professional
i make many recordings and service equipment so i know what is going on in the world ! this disc has a 1/8th&<HASHTAG> ; by 1/8th&<HASHTAG> ; piece of felt glued to a blank cd
i could have done that but i wanted professional ! again , 1/8th&<HASHTAG> ; x 1/8th&<HASHTAG> ;
if you look on the internet it even tells you how to make these
because the lens moves you need the felt to be the entire distance of the cd plus on both side for balance
however this is a tiny dot
you would have to leave it in the player for a week in order for it to clean the lens correctly
shame on you maxell
shame shame !
it worked great for me , but look out the handle on it may break off as it did me
i found out that you really don not need it
the reason i gave it <NUM> stars is the fact it really works .
i tried to use it in my <NUM> ford explorer factory cd changer
no luck
it would just spit it out when it got to the brush section
i know some others had said it worked for them in their car decks and changers , but sadly , it did not work for me
if anyone has any ideas or tips that might help it work , i am all ears .
i just needed something , any brand would have done
worked great , helped alot and was pretty cheap
( under $10 ) no cons .
just as described .
i have used the maxell cleaner in my car and home players ( two of them -- one a recorder where i have cleaned its mirror too ) for <NUM> years and they have never failed
these things don not do much ; you stick it in , listen to some jingoism and a pleasing voice on the first track , then advance to the cleaning track and wait for <NUM> seconds while a continuous beep ensures you turn the volume way down
afterward , your lens is clean
that is all there is to it
why does the lens have to be cleaned ? i can not answer that since i have never seen one
in the cassette era , i bought a clumsy electrical wand with a metal probe that i had to physically touch to my recording and playback heads ( on players too ) to demagnitize them
apparently all that tape going through left some kind of magnetic charge behind that would foul the signal at some point
it is questionable whether the gadget i owned ever actually worked , unlike this product , which works every time
there is no such issue with the digital cd lens cleaner
this disk has some encoded voice commands and about a dozen little brushes the protrude about 1/8 of an inch from the surface of the disk
i guess the disk spins and the brushes rub off the bad stuff from the cd lens
if there is another explanation , i'd like to hear it
it works every time
unfortunately , the thing this product won not do is eliminate age from cranky car cd players
i have owned a couple gm models where the player had to be replaced and the player in my <NUM> chevy malibu is becoming increasingly wearisome
it has a habit of failing to play disks that are thicker than the norm
you'd think there would be a standard in the digital industry but there is not
sometime spinning my maxell arrests this behavior but typically it does not
i usually have to burn myself a homemade disk on a maxell blank disk maxell 32x for music - <NUM> spindle to get the recalcitrant player to spin the music
as for the cleaner , it works in spades every time
buy with confidence for that purpose .
received the shipment , but the first thing i noticed when opening the box were the words "not for laptop use" written on the package
there was no mention anywhere in the specs or description of this item on the site that said it was only for laptops , so since i only have a laptop , i have now needlessly purchased a product i cannot use .
this is one of the best dvd cleaners
i use it to clean my sony dvd burner head once a week .
did the job i needed to clean all discs components , very handy and use ful to have , for all cleaning
i have not use it yet , so i can not write a review for this item at this point , but i will as soon as i use it .
easy to use and cleans a cd or dvd completely
try it and you will think it is good also
great price , much better than buying locally
been having trouble with both my pc dvd drive and video recorder in getting a good clean start and/or play/record
put this in today and followed instructions and after just seconds , removed the cleaner disc and tried some prerecorded discs that have given me trouble in the past
no problems now ! everything i tried out started up lickety split and played perfectly
probably saved me from ordering a new dvd drive for the pc
should have had one of these discs months or years ago
highly recommended .
i was having problems burning dvds in my macbook pro superdrive
bought this and didn not realize it said "not for use in laptops" until after inserting disk and it getting ejected without being recognized by the drive
it worked ! tried burning a dvd afterwards and it worked
i guess it spinning in the drive trying to be recognized did the trick
how 'bout that .
this cd lens cleaner didn not work for our broken system that could no longer read cds
but it has worked on systems in the past
simple and fast to use , you just pop it into the player like a regular cd
there is none of the nonsense with fluids like they had in the old days
it is a simple mechanism- it has a small device that gently cleans the laser lens
so look at it like this : this is a cheap investment to try something that might work for your broken cd/dvd player .
started having issues with my cd player after 12yrs
kept getting read errors
cleaned the reader and not having any additional issues
nothing more than a little dust
also cleaned the <NUM> cd system , thought it was having overheating issues
since it is still cold weather , may still have the issue , however no new problems after using the cleaning disk .
i was ready to purchase a new cd player because the one i had wouldn not recognize any cd/dvd is
i read quite a few ofthe reviews and based on price and reviews i decided on this one
i installed this cleaner into the player and followedthe instructions and in less than a minute everything was working like new
great product .
got this to clean a dvd drive and it wokred as intended
its good and useful good buy recommened
i used this product on a philips dvd recorder
horrible mistake ! it must have screwed up the lens alignment because all discs that are now inserted into the drive come back with the message "no disc" and no playing or recording can be done
it ruined my machine !
i bought this cd lens cleaner a while ago for use with my computer
it seems to work fine , and i have had no problems with it !
this is one of those products where you can never be completely sure if it is doing anything
but i just finished using it for the 40th time , after which it is recommended that you buy a new one , and all the players/burners i have used it on seem to be in fine working order
whether they would be working as well if i didn not periodically clean them is impossible to say
the disc has several small brushes on it that clean the equipment is lens
it takes about one minute
there are also some additional features which i have never used .
i was having a lot of problems with my cd player skipping , refusing to play certain cds , and randomly changing cds
i thought i would have to replace it , which i didn not want to because it is a one , and i just love the sound quality
in the process of shopping for a new player , i came across information on cd lens cleaners
people were saying that they saved their cd player
well , it is true ! don not believe internet information that tells you that eventually the lasers give out ! my <NUM> cd player just had a dirty lens , it wasn not broken
this one has little brushes on the underside that clean off your laser lens
some reviews indicated that this was the only one they tried that the cd player accepted , so that was the reason i picked this one
you put the cd in the player , in my case a <NUM> cd changer , and hit play
it then plays a little music and talks to you ! when it is done cleaning your cd player lens it tells you and lets you continue for a sound system check - basically makes sure your speakers are hooked to the right channels
i was glad to hear that mine were indeed hooked up correctly
tonight i put in a cd that had previously skipped or gotten stuck on a part of a song
will wonders never cease
it played perfectly ! couldn not ask for a better product
saved me a ton of money on a new , high end ( i was going to choose a yamaha ) player .
had trouble with recorder playing and then recording , used this cleaner and now works like new
will use on a regular basis from now on .
how can you tell that these things are actually cleaning your dvd player ? i haven not had any problems but i am just curious if it is actually cleaning .
easy to use , cleaned the cd player - but the cds still skip
ordering a cd cleaner next
the cd is are borrowed from the libary -so maybe they are in really bad shape ? worked for most i guess .
this product was wonderful , i have cd player in my basement which quit playing cd and i used it once and thsat is all it took the lens was clean and have not had any troubles since
i have my doubts as to whether these things do any good or not
never once have i had one clear up a burn problem
there is no substitute for opening the cabinet and blowing it out w/ something like a datavac ( see product on amazon ; it replaces all those cans of compressed air
one of the best investments i have ever made
i blow the dust of discs before i put them in the player
that is how most dust get is in them , on the discs ! ) , and cleaning the lens w/ a foam tipped swab and pure alcohol .
totally disappointed with this product
purchased it after reading several positive ratings on amazon but the disc did not work in my car
the car cd player kept on displaying werror while reading this disc .
i tried this with a player that was not recognizing the cd
initially it seemed to help a little bit
but the problem returned quite soon
so i tried using the cleaner again , i think three times in a row
the problem really never went away .
i purchased this particular disk cleaner based on the reviews i read
it cost a little more but i know maxell to be a good brand
the directions are not clear enough for me - they assume you already understand how the thing works
then , i couldn not get it to work
it was supposed to go in and then start talking
of the <NUM> slots i tried it in it only worked inone and it wouldn not come out without tweezers that scratched the disk
i have a bose player withthe extra disk player which is a very good machine
i had some minor problems with one slot and i was assured the cleaner would take care of it
i never even got the disk to work let alone clean anything
i am afraid to put it in anything for fear i won not be able to get it out again
i don not know if this was a problem with my player but some disclaimer about not working with some players should be added more clearly and should list the brands it doesn not work with .
it really worked for me i noticed a difference after the first application but i actually had to run it maybe <NUM> times total but now no more skips ! might depend on just how dirty your lens is
another plus is the equipment test it can also run on your system , found out my system was out of phase and i didn not know it
just a fantastic product get it ! tom
good headphones
i like ( very much ) that they only have a wire on one side and they are lightweight
the sound is pretty good
i enjoy using them .
my job involves wearing earphones all the time
so if they are tight , my ears get sore and especially where my eyeglasses go behind my ears
these are perfect with really good sound .
obviously these headphones are not for the audiophile
nor are they for the person who expects anything they buy to last for a decade or more
these headphones are for the person who wants tolerably decent sound reproduction in a compact package
commuters , some travelers and others with modest expectations will love these
they fold into a pretty small package that can be tucked into a somewhat large package or a fanny pack or backback or mesenger bag or what have you
the headband has a wide range of adjustment and maintains the position you set it in
the earphones are large enough to cover most ears and are comfortable for extended wear
( i have been wearing them while sitting at the computer for the laat five hours without any discomfort
) if you don not demand much in the way of bass or treble , the audio range is acceptable
as i said , these headphones are not intended for audiophiles
that said , distortion isn not a problem even with the audio cranked up
these headphones don not pretend to be
they are just nice average headphones with adequate audio response and the added benefit of folding into a manageably small form factor
they are sturdy within a limited degree and should last for several months
considering their price , the need to replace them from time to time is hardly a pain
overall , a good value as long as you don not demand or expect more than the product can deliver
these headphones are perfect for the walking ipod/iphone listener
no buds in ear , no strand ear canal
i use other headphones but these are good , like the fold in ear pads
cord could be about 6&<HASHTAG> ; longer , but still okay .
another good buy
again , very affordable , and they work
far less expensive than buying them in a drugstore
i like the single wire , it seems to be much easier to manage than two of them .
this is a great set of headphones cheap only in price
fidelity is fine
design and light weight are impressive .
i have several pairs of another brand for my classroom and they are pretty good
i bought this one to compare and it just feels a little cheap
considering that i buy a pair every month or so , i will try some other brands .
i am not a fussy headphone buyer
i like 'em simple and cheap , so long as they get the job done
sound quality : well , they sound good to me
i have had some headphones sound tinny or &<HASHTAG> ; weird&<HASHTAG> ; , but these sound pretty normal
mind you , i am certainly no audiophile and i abhor &<HASHTAG> ; bass&<HASHTAG> ; in my music and whatnot , so take that into consideration
for basic computer usage and pop music , these sound perfectly fine
comfort : actually , these are the most comfortable headphones i have ever worn
i get headaches if i wear a pair of headphones for too long , due to the pressure on my head
i also can not wear headbands for the same reason
these headphones are so lightweight and flexible that i can barely tell i am wearing them - and so far , no headaches , even though i have worn them for some longer periods than i normally wear headphones
overall , i'd say i am surprisingly impressed with these headphones
i got them expecting the usual cheap headphones i buy ( the brand changes , since i just buy the cheapest 'phones i can find by a brand i have actually heard of ) and was pleasantly surprised by the comfort and quality of these headphones
i haven not had them for long , so i can not speak to the endurance of them , but even if they only last a short bit , i think i'd actually just replace them with these same ones
they are really that comfortable .
i bought these headphones at a tower records about <NUM> years ago
they are nice in that you can fold them and put them in a big pocket or purse and carry them to the gym
today i couldn not hear anything out of the right side so i will need to toss them
i was shopping around on amazon and noticed the other review with the similar problem so i thought i'd add to it , seeing that it may be a common problem with this model
i had only paid around $10-$15 in the first place .
really nice headset--especially for the price--i use it for my radio while i am walking--no more ear buds for me
not even me but also my friends used it for our car cassette players
worked well , no bad comments
i am happy .
i did not have any problem using it but my cassette player ( in car ) is still showing "clean player" message
it is playing the tapes as before and i cannot tell any difference in sound quality , but i should say that the quality was never that bad
i used this product because the player started showing me that message and that problem is not solved
i really don not know whether the cleaner did not do its job or simply my player is faulty ( or have other issues ) .
we bought this maxell audio head cleaner to clean our tape heads on our tape cassette player ( which is now obsolete being that it was created and used by us in the dinosaur age )
it performed exactly as described
it cleaned up the audio heads quite nicely
the music doesn not sound muffled or unclear
now we can play and listen to the oldies of our time the way we used to
if you own a "retro" tape cassette player , then by all means , get this audio head cleaner , it will make it as good as new
great product , highly recommend .
as the author of the jefferson airplane book "take me to a circus tent" and a former radio , i am often asked to write and or discuss various audio products and recordings from the 60 is and 70 is
maxell <NUM> audio tape head cleaner ( wet ) a cassette deck can be cleaned two ways
the maxell <NUM> 10 <NUM> offers the quicker approach ( it will not give you the results of the more time consuming )
the labor intensified cleaning means taking the door off the deck ( for the units that allow this ) and cleaning the pinch rollers and heads with specifically designed swabs and fluid
if you want faster results , maxell has done almost all the work for us
the cleaner looks like a standard cassette
the instructions will specify the amount of liquid to add to the cleaning tape and the length of time to play in the deck
presto that is it ! as always , try to use quality tapes such as maxell or tdk for the cassette portion and please keep the tape heads clean or it circumvents the idea of a nice investment
dirty heads will give the playback muddy results
enjoy the music and be well , craig fentonauthor of the jefferson airplane book "take me to a circus tent"
i use this in conjunction with a demagnetizing tape head cleaner cassette
both are the same exact thing except that this one has no rotating magnet in it
i wet this cassette with plenty of cleaning fluid and it improves the quality of my playback after playing filthy old cassettes
i play it with the dry demagnetizing tape to dry it off and polish it while demagnetizing it
i recommend this tape in conjunction with a demagnetizing head cleaner cassette as well .
i am copying old cassettes to mp3s , and some of the tapes are a real mess , so after running a couple through the tape player , the player starts to sound really mushy
a couple runs through with this tape head cleaner , and it is back to clear sound again
one thing
i noticed another reviewer complained that they were not able to get the liquid out of the bottle because the bottle was too stiff to squeeze
i also had this problem until i realized that you have to stick a pin inside the dropper to break the seal - after that it worked perfectly .
this product arrived from high n low trading with a cracked cleaning fluid container , and all the fluid long gone and dried up
it was functionally worthless , and not worth the cost to ship it back for a refund
i might consider buying one again , but not from high n low trading .
the first of these loaded into the vcr and refused to come out
i trashed that vcr
the second one loaded into a more expensive vcr seemed to work fine ( 6 hrs ) but after <NUM> uses the edge was crinkled and making noise on rewind
again this my be my old vcr is that i no longer own as i switched to a magnavox mdr515h dvr and no more tape plus it also burns cd is or <NUM> gb hard drive ! ( linkmagnavox mdr515h 500gb hdd and with digital tuner
i use tapes over and over
maxell has been the best so far , use to use tdk but they failed way to soon
i have a maxell standard i have used <NUM> times
i tape a lot of stuff maxell high grade is superior to thier maxell standard , for movies you want to save , maxell high grade will do the job .
maxell has always been a good brand of vhs tape and this did not disappoint me
i like it alot .
i use this brand because they last me for years
i use them weekly and they have good video and audio qualities .
vhs tapes are becoming harder to come by
i normally buy sony blank vhs tapes , but maxell had the better deal and work just as well
i have used their products before .
after i initially had some problems , the seller sent me a replacement tape free of charge via priority mail
( initial delivery was also more rapid than expected
) the problems now appear to have been because of some programming inconsistency with one of my vcr recorders
both tapes are now serving well .
we were getting very grained tapes that we could not play back very well
after cleaning the heads with this wet cleaner , we now get a very clear play back picture
good product .
works great ! if you still have the old vcr , this product will do a good job of cleaning it
it is simple to use .
i have used this product time and time again over the years
and when my vcr heads get dirty , and when i play my old vhs tapes , and the picture is scratchy
i clean my vcr heads with the maxell vhs wet cleaner
and after the simple yet highly efficient cleaning this product does , i rewatch the same tape , and the picture quality is as excellent as it was , if i was watching it off my my plasma tv for the first time ! you are not going to find a better vcr head cleaner than the maxell vhs wet cleaner guys !
no one can go wrong with this fantastic product
thank you maxell !
worked as described
cleaned the heads on my vcr/dvd player and the picture quality was better
very easy to use .
this cleaner works very well and is so easy to use
i will order more when this one runs out !
i bought this to clean the vcr player component on a combo machine when we noticed the picture from the vcr was pretty shaky
despite using the dry head cleaner that was on hand , we noticed no improvement
apparently this wet cleaner was exactly what was needed
the picture shaking disappeared and did not return
consider this a remedy for treating a dinosaur in the tech world
glad this was still available .
who still uses vhs tapes these days ? people that haven not converted their beloved old school workout tapes by jane fonda to dvd
i do not fall into this category , but , i was responsible for getting a vcr to work
the old one was eating tapes , received a "new" one from a friend
didn not chew up tapes , but it only showed a quick <NUM> seconds of a tape , then everything was garbled beyond recognition
no matter how much i played with the tracking , it did not improve
ran the maxell vcr cleaner through a few times , seemed like a slight improvement
ignored the direction and instead of putting the fluid through the hole , applied generous amounts directly on the tape ribbon
put it back in the vcr , ran it a few more times , bingo , works again
i read other reviews saying this was not the original maxell vcr cleaner
it seems like it is to me , but bottom line , i could care less , it worked
i will say this though , if you want to convert precious home movies to dvd/digital from vhs , don not use an old vcr
this improved the vcr by magnitudes , but in my opinion , it is not going to be as good as new vcr is that are made specifically for converting and compensating bad track
either that , or , pay one of those services to do it .
this is a good wet cleaner
works great and cleans the tape head so you no longer see static
simple to use and can be used many times .
i have used this product many times before , so knew just what i was getting
it does a very good job of cleaning the track system of your vcr
you will notice a big difference in the clarification of your tapes once you have used this product .
received the maxell vcr head cleaner and loved it
i have always been leary of the dry ones
i have previously had these that had a built in button you pushed to put the cleaner on the cleaning tape
they were a very professional way to go and i loved them
this is about as close as you can get to that
i mostly use my professional vcr to convert my old videos to dvd is so is nice to keep the heads clean so as to do a great job
i would recommend this to anyone .
i have two vcrs that are <NUM> years old
this wet system gently cleans the heads where a dry system might harm them
do not order the cleandr <NUM> vhs video head cleaning system just because it is cheaper than this brand
the cleandr shows a bottle of fluid and describes it as a wet system , but it is not
i ordered that first and was sent a totally dry cleaning tape which i cannot safely use with my old vcrs
so i had to return and then i ordered this brand
i am very happy with this purchase
the boxes ( i ordered 2 ) i received look just like the product pictured here .
believe it or not , some of us still use vhsonly because we are digitizing them now
converting an analog tape to digital media takes its toll on a vcr and the heads get dirty beyond recognition
eventually i will have to tear down my deck to clean it properly but for now this cleaning tape really helps
i tried to play some tapes i'd had stored for a long while , they were defective from age and humidity and made my vcr dirty and unusable
this headcleaner took a few uses to clean the heads , but it got the gunk off and now the vcr works as well as when it was new .
these products are hard to find anymore
while it does appear that this product does clean the heads , the one thing it does not appear to do , is rewind the tape upon completion
do not know why it is becoming difficult to find tape head cleaning products such as this anymore considering that the dvd/vhs players are still being sold .
my hubby and i bought this wet cleaner , due to the fact that we still have vcr is at home
needed this cleaner to keep the heads clean after much usage
we liked it , but eventually , we will have to join the 21st century and start getting dvr is since it is impossible to but new ( old ) vcr is
it did the job , but this product can not be used all the time !
this was the perfect fix for my vcr ! i did have to run it through about three times before it was clean and functional , but worth the time and effort
liquid drops do come with it .
i used this wet head cleaner and my vcr is working much better
i recommned this product to those who still use a vcr .
i have a sony vhs player that had seen very little use yet i managed to apparently ruin by carelessly slotting a home tape inside which ants had made their lair ( life in the tropics ! )
debated cleaning the contaminated heads , but fearing ruining the device i ordered this wet cleaner cartridge instead
it wiped clean the contaminated heads in one single pass and the playback is as good as new .
this cleaning tape has solved the problem with two vcr is that i still use
i don not know how the heads get dirty , but this worked well .
this product was as advertised and came with all of the parts
reviewers who downgraded it must have received a different item .
did the job , worked as instructions said and removed the dirt that it needed to
my player was worn out , so it did not help that problem in the tape jumping
i wasn not able to find one of these in local outlets
i have a bunch of vcr tapes i want to convert to digital , but my vhs player had given me a &<HASHTAG> ; clean heads&<HASHTAG> ; message , and i had noticed more than usual static when i was playing the videos
this cleared that problem up
( the &<HASHTAG> ; wet&<HASHTAG> ; media in the package appears to be isopropyl alcohol , which i will use when the small bottle runs out
this piece of garbage destroyed my magnavox zv450mw8 combo player so that nothing works anymore
amazon owes me a new recorder !
did the perfect job for me , i have an old vcr , i thought was not working , so i thought i would at least try cleaning the heads , most stores now a days do not sell this product anymore , but luckily i found it on amazon , and a great price too , it worked excellent , my vcr is working again , just from the cleaning tape , thanks
this cleaner works very well it is just as advertised and i would recommend this to anyone who needs a cleaner .
we still use our vcrs to watch older tapes and occasionally the units get dirty and project striations on the screen so that the picture is obscured
this happens probably once a month
a couple drops of the maxell vcr wet cleaner on the cleaner unit clears up all problems
the product does exactly what it advertises .
cleaned my old vcr heads pretty good
quality of the tape playing after cleaning increased slightly enough to backup a good vcr tape to dvd
i was volunteered by my wife to record her friend is home vhs tapes onto dvds
i have <NUM> vcrs , both of which i rarely use anymore
between her old tapes and my old vcrs the picture and particularly the sound quality was awful
after i used the maxwell vp200 vhs wet cleaner , the picture and sound improved greatly - probably the same quality as it was when the tapes were originally made about <NUM> years ago
product arrived quickly , and was easy to use
5 stars .
i have three vcr is - a sony dvd and vcr player/ recorder , a dvd and vcr recorder and player , and a third vcr player/recorder
all take the maxell cleaner in but after about a second of play , they stop
virtually no cleaning results .
i have to say its a bit over priced for the fact that most dont even use vhs anymore , but i actually prefer vhs still over dvds because i dont have to worry about resurfacing when scratched so that the move will work again
my vcr had never been cleaned when i purchased it many yrs ago , found this one here on amazon , was not happy that this was the cheapest and not cheap , but had to get it anyway
it did work though !
i could only see a snow screen on my vcr
now it is like new ! i went with the wet cleaner since it looks like that is the best way to clean it if you have big problems .
i give this product my ringing endorsement
in all the years of owning vcrs , i have never really felt the need to use a head really had a problem
long story made short , what i originally thought was a hardware problem turned out to be dirty heads
i was getting sound but only noise on the video
this started again shortly after purchasing a second vcr to replace one doing the same thing which replaced two , older units doing the same thing
there had to be something else
so , after checking all my connections and cables , i purchased this head cleaner
after adding the included cleaning liquid , i ran it for about seconds
the thing plays like new ; well , it was new , but i guess all these old tapes are depositing a lot of residue on the heads as i run them through
i will definitely be using this head cleaner regularly .
excellent vhs head cleaner ! been buying maxwell products for years now and have never had any problem is or anything at all wrong with them !
it fits in a vcr and shuts it off
doesn not do anything but jam the vcr and i had to power on and off just to eject this worthless thing .
keeps the vhs recorder in top shape , great if you use the vcr alot
highly recomend this product
happy taping !
the maxell vhs wet cleaner far exceeded my expections and i will be ordering more of them from you soon
i highly recommend this seller and this product .
i was and still am having thumping noise whenever we use the vcr
this did nothing to help or fix the problem
years ago i used a similar product with great results for a similar problem
is it because the vcr is old or this cleaner ?
the head cleaner works fine
i have no issues that i have seen from this product
it works as advertised .
but vcrs are getting old and so are tapes
can only remove so much
good as far as it goes .
tried this in my sony , jvc , magnavox and panasonic vhs vcr is and it does not work on any of them
don not wast your money .
i needed my old vhs player to work to transfer videos to
mp4 files
this did the trick ! thank you .
it works but it is expensive
on a side note , i was just playing with it yesterday and i happen to stick it on a hood of a canon <NUM> 1
4 ( ) and to my surprise , it fits it like a glove ! it stays there and does fall off
you would think it was made for it ! i just thought that was super cool .
title says it all
this product is so simple and easy to use that even novice photographers should buy this .
i heard others rave about the expodisc for some time
i thought the cost was a little high , especially since there are many other less expensive ways to set white balance ( in camera settings , grey card , coffee filters
don not laugh , i did this and it was actually the next best thing to the expodisc )
well , i bought my expodisc and i am a convert to the church of expodisc
this thing is awesome
it gets me perfect wb every time , whether i am using natural light , bounced flash , strobes , or a combination of all different kinds of light
i have never once had to change the wb in post and my photos look awesome sooc
you can also use the expodisc as an incedent light meter , which is pretty awesome
i would totally buy it again .
i bought the current expodisc to replace an earlier model recently stolen
the old model seemed overpriced , but it was in a low volume production
current models made by new owners are priced about <PERCENT> more than the old , for which you get a fancy box and a few instructions on a cd rather than on a peice of paper - big deal
however , the new models have a lens mounting arrangement which is much superior to the prior model and much more expensive to make
as to function , nothing really replaces an expodisc if you need one for white balancing a color photo exposure
i use mine to shoot "grey" color negatives to automate traditional color printing
i have no experience as to whether they provide superior white balancing in digital systems as claimed , but logically they should do so
unless you plan to be very exacting about color reproduction in your color printing , the excessive cost of an expodisc versus the marginal benefit seems questionable
if you photoshop your pictures to death , you will get no value from this item .
works just like it should
serves as a great way to get proper white balance
just place in front of lens , depress shutter button to focus and light meter , then remove and shoot
images look much better now .
[update 8/19/08 : it is over a year since i wrote the original review - radio looks almost new , cleans easily , works great , and still doesn not require frequent battery changes - still love it ! ]10
you have lost faith that there is such a thing as a good shower radio9
it would be much easier to get psyched for work if you could listen to some good rock while gettin' clean8
it would be much easier to get psyched for work if you could listen to some good npr morning edition while getting clean7
it would be much easier to get psyched for work if you could listen to some the morning tv news while gettin' clean6
all of the above also applies to shaving or putting on makeup5
tend to dawdle ? it has a timer
get out the door before the rest of the nuts get on the road4
it doesn not mind getting wet along with you3
batteries have lasted me a month so far
though i don not care
the sound is so good for a shower radio i'd happily replace them weekly2
oh , the weather channel - very nice , although a bit repetitiveand the top reason you should buy this radio is : 1
ahhh , nine are enough
just buy the thing .
i have used this radio for over a year , almost every morning for <NUM> minutes , and i have only replaced the batteries once
great sound , easy to use
it is a sony , what else do i say ?
surprisingly long battery life
after doing the research , this sony was the one to buy , and it didn not disappoint .
i have had this radio for months now and really like it
i like the digital tuning and timer function
the battery life is great
i am thinking of buying another one .
i owned a sharper image shower radio ( the kind with suction cups that sticks to the shower wall ) for years until it died on me , and thought the poor sound quality is the price you pay for a waterproof radio
i am so sorry i didn not buy the sony sooner ! the sound quality is tremendous
it isn not waterproof but i keep it on a shelf in the shower and it withstands regular spraying with water with no problem
i love the big preset selection ( including local tv channels ) , the easy to use buttons and the timer that turns it off on its own
great machine .
i agree that this is the best shower radio
i have been through ( 3 ) other radios , all bad
this unit is true <PERCENT> digitial , great reception , good sound quality , and easy to use .
it is one of the better shower radios for sure , but it still sounds like a shower radio .
pros : good audio , easy to program , good features
cons : however , the fcc will require broadcasters to switch to a digital format in february 2009
at that time , the radio will no longerr receive televison broadcast audio
therefore , a good percentage of the radio is value is gone ! nationwide , the fcc has reserved <NUM> weather channel frequencies available
usually all <NUM> can not be received
this radio only has <NUM> channels for weather
in my case , none of those <NUM> channels contains any weather signals .
got this for my girlfriend and she loves it
she is had it for a little over a year now , and it is working great
i recommend this product to anyone looking for a good quality shower radio
she keeps it outside the shower to help keep any water from ruining it .
i recently purchased my second sony to replace the first one i purchased almost seven years ago ! that is right
my first sony lasted almost seven years which is why i had no problem replacing it with the same model
the reason why i had to replace the radio is because the plastic lining that covers the buttons on the top of the radio started to crack and water was entering into the radio causing it to not work from time to time
the second reason is because after seven years it started to get discolored due to the humid / wet conditons
i would totally recommend this product because it looks great , last a long time , gets great reception , a huge amount of digital presets and much more !
i looked at several brands of am fm tv weather radios for use during severe weather when power might be out
i was searching for specific features : 1
battery power ( for power outages ) 2
tv band ( tornado tracking is sophisticated enough to get down to tracking on tv
nws hasn not caught up yet ) 3
decent sound qualitythis radio met all my needs with the added bonus of being
( i must admit i am baffled by the term as everything is to one degree or another
) reception is good in all areas of my home ( including those areas where we cower when tornados are lurking )
the radio includes a wire antenna for fm reception which stows in the battery compartment
sony recommends leaving the three &quot ; c&quot ; cells in the radio and changing them every year
this maintains the time and radio presets
pros : good reception , solid design , handy controls , good sound
cons : bigger than some
to avoid finding the radio with dead batteries ( or worse , corrosion in the battery compartment ) , i set reminders in my palm to change various batteries annually .
i have bought sony shower radios for <NUM> years - this is the third ( and by far the best ) model , and i have had at least one of all three models
the digital tuning is essential - you never have to worry about finding or keeping your station
i love the presets , and listening to <NUM> minutes and similar tv shows is great
the solid base means it is less likely to fall over , or off of things
the radio is pretty tough - i have dropped it and had nothing happen , but once the am antenna broke and that was that for talk radio
and the batteries really do seem to last forever ! on the one i have now ( five years old ) , the plastic waterproof top is cracking , and the fm antenna caught on something and pulled loose
so , i am buying another
don not ever stop making this radio , sony !
i have had this radio for over <NUM> years now and the only problem is with the fm tuner ( it died in less than one year )
it still works with am , weather , and tv
since i use it for primarily am , it is not a big deal
speaking of am , this has absolutely the best am reception of any radio i have had
one last comment : the batteries last quite a while
i use it at least <NUM> - <NUM> mintues a day and have only replaced the batteries once in three years
if you are looking for a shower radio , this is it !
no need in me going thru all of the features
you can see them in the product description
a few things that are important though before you purchase a radio for your bathroom
make sure it has a digital tuner
you want to know you are on the right station and you don not want it to drift
get one that has a large battery capacity
ensure it has a timer
you don not want to have to remember to shut it off when you leave the room
as far as reception - mine picks up great ! ( even without the antenna extension ) this unit has all of these features , plus many more
i think you will be very pleased if you purchase this unit - i know i am !
i have had this shower radio for several months
i purchased a similar model for my parents several years ago
i liked is so much , that i finally decided to purchase one for myself
not only can this shower radio withstand exposure to water , but the quality of the sound and reception is excellent for its size
it is very intuitive to use .
i am on my second one - had my first one for a year before my sister swiped it and took it back to alabama with her
i guess she must have liked it a lot too
after about a week without it i had to buy another
i do not use it in the shower but i do keep it in the bathroom on top of the toilet tank
wow is it great
one push on top and the radio is on
you don not even need to have your glasses on because the button is big
push another button and you set a timer for it to go off after <NUM> or <NUM> minutes so you don not have to remember to go back in and turn it off
i am listening to the morning news while i brush my teeth and dry my hair and put makeup on , and i can put it on a classical music station for a soak in the tub after work
it is not too big , the controls are simple and intuitive , and it looks nice
the battery lasted in the first one for the whole year before my sister took it - it is probably still running at her house on the same battery
i looked at a lot of radios before i found this one - i wanted waterproof , not too big , no cord - there just isn not anything close
highly recommended if you'd like a radio in the bathroom .
picked this one up based on the reviews of this site
absolutely worth it
great sound and ease of use .
i have always listened to news radio in the mornings and i like to take long showers
this is absolutely the way to go if you want to listen to radio in the shower
i have had it for over <NUM> years now and it has been through just <NUM> batteries
it comes with a bundled antennae which you can stick to the shower is wall and reception is amazing
buttons are easy to operate and it can even tune into local tv stations so you get the audio
sometimes i do have to crank up the volume to hear over the shower noise , but i never go more than half way up
this shower radio is excellent , get it now .
i purchased this radio from amazon in may of 2003
it is now january <NUM> and the radio is still on the first set of batteries
i use it at least a 1/2 hour a day and on weekends as much as hours per day
it shows no sign of wear even though it has spent hundreds of hours in the shower , and has even been in light rain beside our spa
it gets great reception ( no tv signals in our town ) , is easy to use , and sounds great
i highly recommend this radio
update oct 28 , 2010after <NUM> 1/2 years of daily use my sony shower radio finally quit
as many others have reported the plastic on the top cracked , water got into the off button area and the radio would no longer work
however i just ordered another one
this radio has some very good qualities
pros : 1 ) clear and loud sound2 ) battery life is so long it is ridiculous
i don not think i used more than three sets of batteries in <NUM> years , and i use the radio every day
3 ) good reception
4 ) ease of use
i really appreciate an am/fm radio with station presets
5 ) it is waterproof enough that i take it in the shower every day
i don not leave it there though because i use it on the bathroom counter while i shave too
perhaps mine lasted longer than many others because it isn not in the damp shower area 24/7
6 ) i like the top buttons
they are easy to hit with one hand
if the buttons were on the side or front it might require two hands
my radio is never mounted high so i don not have the issue others complain about where they can not see the buttons
even if i did have it high it is easy to feel where the buttons are as they all have a raised bump
cons : 1 ) $49 is a very high price to pay for an am/fm radio
2 ) it does seem sony could do some research and improve the plastic top so it would last longer
i was pleased to see this radio is still available for sale
i looked at a few others but nothing matched , in my opinion , this one .
the sony is a another good example of the old phrase "you get what you pay for"
at $50 i was hesitant to purchase this radio but i am delighted i did , it is worth every cent
battery life is simply amazing , i listen to it for a minimum of hours each and every day and i am still on the first set of batteries after <NUM> months , i have even accidentally left it on for the entire day several times
wow ! 2
excellent reception for all bands ; am , fm , tv , and weather
simple , convenient buttons and operation
the o4
peace of mind with water resistance , i have not placed it in the shower but do have it in the bathroom which often gets quite steamy
excellent sound for the type of radio it is , clear and loud
small footprint takes up little space
like the wire antenna , didn not think i would at first
it is better than a hard antenna sticking up waiting to be bumped and/or broken
timer and timer are quite nice also , even though i sometimes forget to use the timer
digital tuning and display makes it simple to find the station you are looking for
the fit and finish is outstanding , the radio looks and feels very well constructed
overall a worthy purchase .
this is a nice little radio
it has good sound quality & it is easy to tune and to set up the clock and the station presets
the timer function is useful since it does run on batteries
my only issue is that i wish an ac adapter was included so that i didn not always have to run it on batteries .
by far the best waterproof radio on the market
i am purchasing my second radio only because after nearly several years of abuse from twin teenagers , it finally is starting to wear out
i will not be without one in my bathroom .
this is a classic little gizmo
we have used one since the late '90s and , even though the off button has long since worn through , it still works like a charm
i have purchased others as gifts for bewildered friends and once they have spent a little time with it they love it
target and other stores have stopped selling them as retail , but i hope sony continues to make this little shower radio and doesn not screw it up with any "improvements
i have had one of these for about ten years and love it
it lives in my shower
the plastic on top has cracked over the years but it works fine
i use it to listen to the local tv station news in the morning
i just bought two more for my kids
* note- since tv has gone digital , i can no longer catch the tv station in the morning .
this radio has been good - i have owned several sony radios , and this unit is quality is among the best
very good sound , built very solidly , controls are easy to use and understand
my only wish is that they had better mounting options - i have it hanging from a shower mirror now , there has got to be a better way to mount a radio , with a bracket or something .
great reception , easy to use and good sound for a one speaker radio .
i have tried several waterproof radios and these sony is are the only ones that work well
if the volume went a little louder i would have given it <NUM> stars .
the sound quality is pretty good and the radio reception is very good
previous shower radios we had were far worse in both areas
i especially like the programable buttons since we each like different stations
even though the screen fogs the lcd is still readbale
the only reason i gave it <NUM> stars is because i think the price is a bit high for a shower radio .
a wonderful product
. very clear reception
the flat , broad bottom is a great feature as it prevents tipping it over when it is placed on a surface such as a sink
be aware that the tv channel reception feature will cease in <NUM> when all transmission goes digital
until then , enjoy it !
now i don not have to miss ten or fifteen minutes of my favorite morning talk shows while i get ready for work
i have got this little jewel sitting on the toilet tank where it can project sound into the entire bathroom ! i love having the waterproof controls on the top and the station presets
this radio also has very good reception , bringing in one of the weaker stations i like loud and clear
my one complaint is that it has two very little rubber pads on the bottom
that means the designers thought of slide resistance ( like when the radio sits on something made of porcelan ) but they didn not do enough to prevent it
this radio needs big rubber pads on the bottom , and then it would be perfect .
when home , i have the radio on a lot of the day , mainly talk radio
i bought <NUM> of this radio in august <NUM> ( yes , three zeros ) and they bit the dust in late 2007
i got about <NUM> years of excellent performance from these radios
i have <NUM> because one sits on bathroom sink and goes back & forth from bedroom to bathroom while getting dressed
the other goes between kitchen and office constantly
there is <NUM> presets for am
i wish there were more
there is <NUM> presets for fm
one used to be for howard until he left ( a huge howard fan here who has not gone sirius ) and now i basically only use one for ( when they got smart and realized , in the immortal words of ny daily news , that they didn not know jack ) , and the others go unused
the tv channel part of this radio , i never use and couldn not comment
the radio is excellent
the controls are responsive , the battery life is very decent , and most importantly , the reception is excellent
the reason my radios now need to be replaced ( i just ordered one from amazon and will try the sangean for the second ) is that the top of the radio is covered in plastic
after <NUM> years of pressing the on/off button i am sure thousands of times , the plastic over the on/off button ate through
the on/off button needs that plastic over it to work ! the damn thing won not turn on/off now ! i tried turning the volume down to zero to "turn it off" but the batteries do wear out and it is annoying
so i figure that <NUM> years of constant usage is pretty good and i am not complaining and have even come back for more ! in spite of the life , i still give this radio the highest rating
fair is fair , right ? can not complain about <NUM> years of perfect performance , can we ? i say no .
this is without a double the 'best' shower radio i have ever owned
the reception is crisp and clear and i love the stations
it is also a very attractive radio and so when not in the shower with me , it looks nice sitting on my bathroom counter
it is very user friendly ; no complicated directions
perfect for us 50+ technically challenged
i would definitely recommend this product to everyone .
the only reason this doesn not get a <NUM> is because it isn not very loud
i honestly didn not expect it to be , especially with a single speaker
everything else works as advertised
i can get tv/am/fm/weather stations well
the old curtis shower radio i had was very spotty
digital tuning is awesome
the old one was analog and a real pain to lock on to stations that had a great signal
the presets work wonderfully , and the timer feature was an added bonus
only time will tell if it lasts though
the curtis died after a year and a half
if the sony lasts that long i will be more than happy .
notice this unit was introduced two and a half years ago and still going strong which indicates to me people really like it and it holds up well
i have had mine about six months
it is got everything a radio should have and nothing it doesn not need , except maybe the digital clock
the knob on the right top is volume
the rest of the controls are push buttons on the top that include five presets for each of three bands
the buttons are under a protective rubber cover so no need to worry about humidity or splashes
it has an 18" antenna with a little suction cup at the end so you can hook it on a mirror
and it has a loop of twine on the back for carrying it around or for hanging it on a coat hook or something similar
i find its clunkiness sort of endearing
the sound quality is all you could ask for , and the reception is excellent
so for what it is , it is probably as good as it gets .
i purchased this for my dad who uses it in a basement sauna
the radio sounds nice and is easy to use , but does need to be positioned a bit for good reception
he is very happy with the radio .
after researching shower radios and looking at ones that cost almost twice as much , i decided on the sony and i am impressed with the following points : 1
great fit and finish
not too big
seems smaller out of the box than photos on internet suggest
this is good for cluttered showers
controls for clock , tuning and presets
i didn not even need to consult the manual
excellent sensitivity for am ( internal ferrite antenna ) and fm ( a wire from the battery compartment )
full sound to overcome shower noise
sony is decision to require <NUM> c batteries insures life between battery changes
so far i have not found any weaknesses with the radio
sony has found a niche in their shower radio
i give it the fullest recommendation , especially for the price ( and free shipping no less ) i found on amazon .
update : i have had the unit now for about two years
it still works fine , although the material covering the on/off button has worn completely off
actually , it started wearing off after less than a year
in light of the fact that this is designed to be a "shower radio , " this is really an inexcusable flaw : after all , you cannot use the radio in the shower if water will seep into the innards of radio
fortunately , i never used the radio in the shower itself
but , still , i'd have to take at least one star , even two stars off , for this defect ( which i know other reviewers have commented on as well )
the radio was a little smaller than i expected , but that is good
it takes up very little room on my bathroom counter and is quite unobtrusive
the reception is generally very good , although i tend to listen to only one station ( 89
3 kpcc )
still , i had trouble getting good reception with my last radio ( an aiwa ) , so the sony is a big improvement
occassionally , i still get a little static ( depending on where i am standing in relation to the radio ) , but overall i would give it a score of 4
0 in terms of reception ( i still occassionally get some static )
i also tested all of the tv stations , and the sony had no problem tuning them all in
no static to speak of , although the volume was low
i would definitely recommend this radio
the sound quality is quite good for a radio as small as this
i have to crank it fairly high to hear when i am taking a shower ( even though it is waterproof , i don not put in the shower with me )
however , there is not distortion at high volume
i cannot say anything about the battery life yet , but overall i am very satisfied with the radio .
edit : well it has been over <NUM> years since i purchased and reviewed this shower radio and it finally bit the dust
radio still works ( though lately i need to move it around a bit for best reception ) and the clock is still really hard to see
it is the volume button that is kaput
i can only get very loud and painfully loud
husband tried to fix it but couldn not do it
seven years is pretty good , i guess
i don not see anything better on amazon , at least for this price , so i will probably purchase another of the same
something i did not mention in my original review : the batteries seem to last forever
same number of stars for the same reasons
original review : this shower radio is attractive , compact and has great sound and station range
it is a <NUM> for the radio and a <NUM> for the clock
unfortunately , the clock is very small and hard to read
i purchased it to place on a small bathroom chest close to the sink , but could not read the digital clock from there
if the radio is placed too high or too low , the small clock numbers are partially shadowed by the clock frame
there is no back light which adds to the difficulty
i had to place it on the sink vanity right next to where i stand and i still have to bend down slightly to check the time
if having great sound in a shower radio is really what matters to you , this sony is for you
if you really need a clock in the bathroom , this is not the one for you .
this radio is nice with digital display and nice membrain push buttons
the battery capacity is good
lasts a long time
the thing that is disapointing is that you can not recieve any weather stations even though other radios in the area do ! also the am reception is no better than the <NUM> year old radio i replaced .
the radio seems good at first but they don not hold up to use in the shower
i have had two of these which have died after several months of use , and am trying a different brand instead .
i selected this radio for myself several years ago and i have found that all claims for it are true
it has excellent reception , clear sound , and the batteries last forever
i don not use mine in the shower itself , but sitting on the cabinet
volume is very good
my recent purchase was a gift ; there was no other shower radio that seemed to work as well
they were cheaper , but if they don not work , what have you gained ?
sony does it again
they have put together a great radio for the bathroom
it is easy to set up the time , presets , etc
the sound and reception are great
the controls are on top and protected
the display could be brighter and i wish it had a way to hang it on the wall when not in use ( it comes with a cord for hanging in the shower ) , but it is compact and does not take up too much space on the counter and it looks nice
i haven not actually put it in the shower since i can hear it just fine from the counter .
if your looking for a radio for your shower , then look no further
this gets great reception and the timer to shutoff feature is very handy .
this product gets used minutes per day on average
i also use it around the house as a portable radio so it gets hrs of use maybe once every other week
they say the battery life is <NUM> hrs , but that must be if you use it <NUM> straight hours
we received the radio in early march , put in <NUM> batteries , and they are still going strong ( it is now december )
sometimes i am shocked when i find a consumer electronic product that works well , works simply , and works reliably
this is one of those products .
reception is outstanding
easy to set up stations
timed on/off is automatic
easy to read display
great sound for a mono speaker
battery life is amazing
worth the price
i would happily repeat the purchase if i manage to wreck this radio
update : the tv function of this radio is not functional with the digital tv change over .
very easy to use basic functions
good tone , sufficient volume
don not know what i would change , if i could
well done .
worked well , but after about one year it died
i am guessing water got into it
my daughter used it in her shower , and i am thinking she allowed it to be directly exposed to the shower .
i was given this shower radio <NUM> years ago as a gift
i have listened to npr in the shower almost every day since then , and it has lasted and performed well
finally the plastic cover over some of the buttons on top started to crack and break off , so i just bought a new one
it lasts many months ( 6 months ? ) on <NUM> 'c' batteries
the reception is pretty good
i was hoping that sony would have made it a bit more modern in appearance , but it looks decent enough for a shower radio
i like the countdown timer , as i can turn it on for <NUM> minutes when i take a shower , and by the time i am done dressing it shuts off automatically
thus , i don not have to get back in the shower ( wet floor ) to turn it off .
i have to say , this radio works flawless in my shower
i have had it for a little over <NUM> months and i listen to it daily for about <NUM> minutes at a time and i still have yet to change the batteries on it ( 2 aa i believe )
prior to this shower radio i had a brookstone am/fm shower radio which took <NUM> c batteries and i would have to change them about once a month
i get great reception of my fm stations and i even get some tv audio through it , to listen to the football games
it is very small and sits nicely on my pedastel and comes with a suction cup antenna
all in all , i strongly recommend this shower radio over any other on the market
no problems , no complaints .
we have had ours for a year , use it daily ( in the shower and all over the house ) , and it still looks and works like new
we may have replaced the batteries once
maybe not , i can not remember
keep in mind that it is not designed or sold as a radio
it is not stereo , and the speaker is not large enough to provide a wide frequency response
but for its size and shape , it is as loud and clear as it can possibly be
you will never find a better radio for use in the shower : the reception is outstanding
the speaker is clear and loud enough to hear in the shower
the case is attractive and tough
the controls are easy to operate , even with wet hands
how often do you buy a product that is reasonably affordable and absolutely flawless ? update 11/7/08 : my wife still won not just leave this radio in the shower , to my occasional chagrin
she carries it around the house to listen to npr while she works on stuff and i can never find it when i want it
today she dropped it on our hardwood floor
the battery door popped off , and and the batteries spilled out
she put them back in and npr was again heard from the radio
why haven not you bought one of these yet ? update 8/31/2010 : still going strong
this radio is no longer available , but theicfs79wseems to be an able replacement
what a workhorse this radio has been !
i have been using these for over a year now
basically , in a quiet environment these sound pretty good
they aren not as good as headsets , but you are paying for the noise cancelling
the raw capability is pretty decent , and has acceptable detail in treble , vocal , and bass ranges
the noise cancelling works pretty well
i have taken these on several intercontinental flights and they do a decent job of blocking out engine rumble and screaming kids
they also do a decent job of blocking out adult human voices , which is nice in the office
however , i must have pretty big ears , and i have found that the foam cups aren not quite thick enough to adequately push the driver away from my outer ear
after <NUM> or <NUM> hours of use my ears start to ache a bit
the cord is plenty long , and can be disconnected in the middle to link to an optional sony wired remote control
an adapter to convert the standard 1/8th inch stereo jack to the dual 1/8th inch jacks in many airplane seats is included
the thing that i don not like about this is that i find these uncomfortable when i try to lean my head against the window in an airplane and sleep
i think that the is might have been a better choice in that regard
they are also kind of bulky unless you have a large to keep them in
i am paranoid about putting these in the seat pocket in front of me , since the is come with a soft bag instead of a rigid clamshell like the bose headsets
i haven not had any spills yet , but active travellers may wish to find a case that is more rigid
all in all , i am pretty happy with these
the natural audio sound and the noise cancelling are plenty sufficient for the price
i couldn not justify the $300 for bose unless i needed the protective clamshell and had ears that fit perfectly into their earcups .
i will admit that i recently gave up my sony headphones for the bang and olufsen a8 is ----- however , that was more for portabilities sake , than soundwith regards to sound , this is the best pair of headphones that i have usedthe noise cancelling features are excellent ! -- putting these things on , along with the noise cancellers , allows you to hear sounds that you never knew existed within many of your favorite songsi compared these headphones , head to head , on an airplane , against the bose quiet comfort 2 , and there was no difference in sound - both performed excellently , and equally , within the airplane environment ---- however , the sony ones were more comfortable and much cheaperdon not even waster your time with the bose quite comfort ---- grab a pair of these and you will fall in love quick !
i bought these thinking they were the ticket to , pleasant air travel
they fall short for two reasons
the first is that they just don not cancel that much noise
if you are not listening to music and just compare the difference between having noise cancellation on and off , it is just not that great - partly because of the technology and partly because of the fit
to quantify this , the noise canceling sony headphones give 10db of noise reduction whereas the passive david clark headphones for roughly the same price give 24db just because of the better seal
the second problem is that they generate noise of their own
if it is not that noisy to start with they actually seem to generate a slight buzz
so i'd recommend either getting a pair of earplugs , or a set of headphones with a better seal .
i have owned these for years
i used to fly two round trips a week , and i wore these constantly , whether or not there was any reason to ( in flight entertainment , a cd player )
the first benefit is that the noise reduction made speech more audible
i could hear the person in the next seat better , and , in fact , i found that i could eavesdrop on people a row or two away , since the noise that would normally have masked their conversation was masked , but the speech came through
the loud , constant background sound in airplanes is very draining
i was more likely to be able to nap with these on , and i was more likely to be able to concentrate on reading with less background noise
don not get a unit that simply insulates the sound - you might as well use earplugs or sealing earbuds
there is nothing wrong with that solution , it is just that the solution of generated countersound ( exactly out of phase , exactly the right amount and frequency for the sound that is incoming ) , especially when the countersound is based on microphones that are right at the earphones - as far as i am concerned , nothing works as well
microphones that are placed in an device can not tell where the headphones are direction , or what in the environment might be changing the sound at the headphones
this effect is not as important at low frequencies , but it becomes more important at higher frequencies , so this unit can provide more coverage
the design is simply the best possible - microphones as close to the ear as possible is a huge design benefit
well , being in a quiet environment works better , but that is not always available
when you are flying , especially if you fly a lot , small incremental increases in comfort really are worth it
these cost me less than a quarter per flight , have lasted years and are still going strong
sound quality was fine
i could head spoken voice programming just fine , and , far as i was concerned , music was enjoyable
airline provided programming was much better than the provided headphones .
i have used the headphones for <NUM> years -- they offer a material reduction in the "droning" noise on airplanes
even when i am ready to sleep and i turn my music off , i leave the headphones on and it reduces the ambient noise
i think you arrive much less fatigued .
i own these and the bose quiet comfort <NUM> ( $250
00 ) and i can honestly tell you the bose phones are not impressively better and certainly not worth $250
00 .
i have owned these for over two years and wore them about <NUM> times , mostly on plane rides
i have a relatively small head , so i keep them at the first expansion level
even so , there is a lot of pressure
after about an hour they start to hurt my ears
i have tried to "stretch" them , but they always return to the same size
i also put extra foam padding in the ear cups , which helped a little
they still have good sound quality , and cut noise- although they are not as effective as when i first bought them
i tried the new bose
they fit better and they do a much better job of eliminating noise , but of course they are much more expensive .
 is out of date these days , but these are just as good a quality as they were when they were the main format
recorded a few things with my old camcorder , no issues .
a very good product .
these tapes worked nicely in my old jvc camcorder
they did make a bit of noise when recording and playing back , though
for some reason other tapes didn not do this
but it was a very faint sound , and i am happy .
i cannot find thm anywhere else ! you all have a good price for them too
i wonder if i may order more ? but first i'd like to find the ones i needed ! you sent them to the wrong place !
havent had chance to use the tapes in camcorder yet
i bet i will use this year welll i hope
i recommend this products but today may concorde not use more but it is good when i have <NUM> years ago
i have only used it one time and so far i am quite satisfied
will order again in the future .
worked just as i needed , i know its old style , but hey this works for me and my older video camera
this tapes came out o
k just like i expected for my camcorder real nice colors and easy to deal with .
these are great tapes and are getting harder to find , i love my old camera and these tapes keep it working for me .
these tpes fit perfectly and have been very reliabl eon my video shoots
i will be purchasing more in the future .
she loves these ! although prime is no longer a <NUM> day process , she still received it in soon enough to take more recordings of her grandchildren .
these maxell <NUM> mm camcorder tapes are a pretty good product
i bought these years ago when i needed to borrow my brother is camcorder that requires <NUM> mm tapes
nowadays , they are getting harder and harder to find , as everything now is digital/hard disk
the picture and sound quality on these tapes isn not quite as good as the more expensive <NUM> mm metal tapes , but it is decent enough to do an adequate job of capturing your moments
i swear , the picture and sound quality on the <NUM> mm camcorders and <NUM> mm metal tapes is sometimes better than some of the hard disk camcorders
i have a hard disk camcorder , but sometimes i wish i had an <NUM> mm camcorder
i recommend these maxell <NUM> mm tapes , but i would try to get the metal kind if you want really good picture and sound quality .
it works for me
that is all it has to do
it was and still is , an interesting idea who is time came and is still with us .
i have had my palm iiix for over a year now , but i am going to have to get another , because i dropped it
the palm didn not fall far -- <NUM> feet or so -- but it is now useless
white lines cover the display , and the digitizer no longer works reliably
i have tried opening up the case and the circuit boards , which fixed most of the problems , but the digitizer is permanently inaccurate
even with of the digitizer using preferences , the location the palm thinks i am hitting with the stylus is wrong , and this makes using the palm impossible
i bought the slimline leather case , but this clearly failed to protect the palm in any way
also , the velcro has now come unstuck , so my palm won not stay in the case
this is a real shame , as my palm iiix is indispensable
i bought intellisync software to syncrhonize it to the calendaring software i have on my pc , and i use it every day to navigate my schedule
combined with the address book for names and phone numbers , i have one place to work out what i am supposed to be doing and whom i am doing it with
i don not use the other applications much
i tried out the application , but it is way too simplistic
i get over <NUM> a day , and i really need folders with automatic filtering to manage that kind of volume
i use eudora , and the palm application doesn not support its folders or filtering
i can not even convince it to just download the messages left in my &quot ; in&quot ; box after all the others have been filtered out
being able to upgrade the operating system on the iiix turned out to be important
version 3
3 of palmos supports sync with a laptop
this is a godsend when i am travelling , and for syncing during long meetings
being able to upgrade easily from palmos 3
1 made it possible
i have also downloaded a few games to while away long plane trips -- pocketchess is my favourite
very easy to play -- just drag 'n' drop the pieces
i have looked at the handspring visor as a replacement , but lack of upgradeabile os is a key sticking point
handspring devices are stuck at palm os 3
1 , and handspring is code seems to have diverged at this point with no hope of picking up any changes 3
long term , this could turn into a real problem assuming palm continues to improve palmos
the springboard expansion slot is a great idea , but there are so few expansion cards available that its utility is a joke
color cases looked cool -- until i saw them in real life vs
a photo on the web
they look kinda cheap &amp ; nasty
so , i will probably buy another palm iiix
the iiie isn not expandable , and i can not see how color is so useful that it justifies the staggering price of the iiic
the palm v looks cool but i am even more worried about its fragility , and the palm vii could be great if it could actually surf the web , rather than use extraordinarily limited &quot ; web clippings&quot ; .
the palm will certainly revolutionize the way you arrange your life
at the touch of a button , you can connect it to your pc and transfer all of its information ( which also means you can input information to your palm from your pc )
there is a myriad of freeware available on the net that will enhance the performance of the palm iiix
the screen is great for viewing
4mb is more than you will ever need ( i have many programs loaded , and thousands of phone numbers and appointments , and i only use 1
3 mb )
the great advantage of the palm iiix is that it uses batteries ( versus the palm v and vx , which are rechargeable ) , which means you don not have to carry your cradle when you travel , and you can get batteries for it anywhere ! small , lightweight , highly efficient
i highly recommend it .
pretty easy to use and down load programs for someone that can spell kompooter <NUM> out of <NUM> times .
having used a paper daytimer for years , i was a little skeptical about going electronic with my datebook and phone listing
boy , have i been converted ! the palm iiix ( my second palm - the first being a iii ) is , for me , a great value
it has enough memory for anyone but the most compulsive , yellow page totin' workaholic among us
( i download an average of <NUM> palm formatted web pages a day and have had no problem with space in memory at all
i also keep about <NUM> phone listings and several hundred appointments in the unit at all times ) it has the improved screen and processor versus the iii
and it has the benefit of the palm community of software developers that is what sets palm devices apart from windows ce ( and other ) devices
i like the cover both for protection and for the star trek communicator look : ) and feel
the backlight takes a little getting used to
it is not useful at all for dim daylight use , but works just fine in dark situations
i really want the palm vx for the sexy size and industrial feel , but i have no real reason to move away from a device that does everything i need and more ( and costs a lot less ) .
i have had my palm iiix for almost <NUM> years now , and it is still working as well as the day i bought it ! i am more than satisfied with palm products , and am currently looking into a tungsten as an upgrade
the windows based palmtops are nice too , but they cannot beat the palm is reliability and ease of use
the software is also very stable and easy to use
this is the only device of its kind i own that has never lost data or become corrupted
reliability goes a long way with me , so i give it <NUM> stars !
the big questions these days is what organizer to get
i will assume you are reading these reviews because you already know that the palm os beats ce any day
so the choice is a palm vx , a palm v , a iiix or a visor
i can not recommend the visor right now due to the horrible problems people are having with handspring
maybe in another year , but not now
the new vx is a good choice , lots of memory and the other advantages of the palm v like a better screen , and rechargeable battery
but the darn thing is still overpriced
if money is no problem though , i'd probably go with the vx
the v is good too , but only <NUM> meg of memory
yuck ! now , <NUM> meg of memory is going to be enough for a lot of people
if all you want to do is the basic appointment/phone book/ stuff , <NUM> meg is more than you will ever need
but that is it
you are stuck with <NUM> meg and can not upgrade ( easily )
if you are interested in using your palm to do internet stuff , grab webpages with avantgo , play games , read books , etc
you are going to find yourself a bit squeezed by <NUM> meg
you can still do quite a bit , but it is a bit more work to manage your space
now , for less money you can get the iiix
you will have twice as much memory , and the ability to upgrade
i personally put on the trg xtra xtra pro board which gave me <NUM> meg more of ram and <NUM> meg more flash
it is like having an <NUM> meg palm ! really great
of course , i bought this before the palm vx came out , today it is not quite as good a deal to do
one other reason i like the palm iiix is that i have a lot of that only work with it
the palm navigator ( compass ) , the weatherguide , landware is govox voice recorder , etc
i don not believe these will fit a palm v
of course , it goes both ways
palm is new 33
6 modem and the new wireless omnisky modem only fit the palm v
i do believe the palm v has a better screen , it doesn not seem to have the streaks that a lot of the palm iiix is have
and there is no doubt it has a certain &quot ; coolness&quot ; factor
most of my friends at work went with the palm v
but they are fairly impressed with the space and the accessories i have for my palm iiix .
i have to say that i have grown very dependent on my iiix
i'd give it a score of <NUM> except for the streaking problem
mine didn not do this right away
it started hapening about <NUM> months after i began to use it
sometimes its there sometimes it isn not
when its there , the streaking ( looks like water was spilled on a sheet of ink writing ) can make the screen totally unreadable
five minutes later , all can be fine
pda need to be dependable
mine isn not always
before i started reading other reviews , i thought mine was just broken
i was considering buying another but not if by luck , i get another &quot ; streaker&quot ;
even though i like the iiix , its reasonably priced ( though still expensive ) , has great software options , i'd be cautious about buying another one
probably wouldn not go with the iiix if i had known about the streaking problem in advance .
i absolutely love my palm iiix
originally , my wife ordered a handspring visor for my birthday
six weeks later , with no indication of when ( if ever ) the visor would be shipping , she cancelled it and ordered the palm iiix for me instead
i have been playing endless with it since
i find , for example , it is easier to write on the pda than on paper in a moving car ; hence , car rides can be much more productive
then i found out about downloading games from the internet
i have been wasting endless amounts of time playing a beloved game from my college days ( &quot ; rogue&quot ; ) .
this is my first dvd after thinking about it for two months
i have only purchased it since dvd is are entering the rental market
with <NUM> lines of resolution ( using the connector cable ) , this system has the same picture quality of any current dvd player ( dont be fooled ! ) , the sound can still be decoded for dolby surround
great buy !
this dvd player is cheap for a reason
you get what you pay for
most of the time this player works fine
but sometimes the picture will cut out and give you just a blue screen
you can sometimes just tap the machine and it comes back on , other times you have to stop the movie and open the tray just to get rid of the blue screen
luckily this doesn not happen that often
if you don not have a lot of money to spend on a dvd player , go for it , but if you can spend more i would recommend something on the higher end of the scale .
i have had the displeasure of owning two rca brand dvd players and neither one made it more than a year before breaking
i had this dvd player and a proscan dvd/divx ( which the salesman at [
] swore was the best that money could buy )
the rca dvd just quit working entirely after <NUM> months ( microprocesor )
my [$] proscan dvd player now displays a "no disc" message seemingly at random , and for no particular reason
sometimes you can put a disc in and it will play the first time , others you have to try it a few times , and on the worst days you may have to try times and it still may not work
in both cases i called rca , sat on hold for some ridiculous amount of time , spoke to someone in technical support who knew nothing about technical support , and was ultimately told it would cost more to repair than to replace
rca is warranty is useless , their technical support line is an exercise in futility , and i personally don not think it is worth the money to repair any of their poorly engineered products
i have learned my lesson with rca and will specifically avoid their products in the future .
gave it to my brother - not because the first one broke ! i have had it for a year now - and not once did it ever give me a problem - watch the matrix regularly
i get rental dvd is ( more scratched - usually &quot ; more difficult to play&quot ; ) about twice a week - and in the last <NUM> months of renting so frequently i have never had a disc that gave me a problem
overall , i think there is no reason to buy a more expensive dvd player - like cd players , they are one and the same unless you are really descriminate about quality or features not detectable to an average consumer .
i was initially concerned about buying the rca 5220p dvd player after several of the reviews i read here
however , i decided to give it a try and am thoroughly glad i did
great picture , great sound ! plenty of features
i have not experienced a single problem with error messages on any of the dvd is i have purchased
this is one great little machine for the price !
not having either a dvd or cd player ( i just feed discs to my imac ) , i found the discounted price on this model to be all the rationale i needed to invest in such a device
it is capable of producing flawless images and sounds--unless it chooses not to acknowledge the presence of a disc in its drive , which happens far too often with my temperamental ( fastidious ? ) machine
i would also advise prospective purchasers to check dimensions , as this model requires extra deep shelves
finally , its remote switch is more likely to be compatible with ge or other rca monitors than with philips , magnavox , or sylvania monitors
( it may be important to remember that a vcr plus dvd assembly requires running the latter in &quot ; auxilliary mode , &quot ; which is hidden away somewhere in my set is menu choices and virtually inaccessible
) in short , the machine has done little to alter my high regard for similar products produced by sony , panasonic , and other japanese manufacturers .
i bought this player about a year and a half ago
it worked great ( for about <NUM> months )
it played all the dvds and cds
unfortunately , it cannot read vcds or /rws
for most people that doesn not matter , i guess
however , only after about <NUM> months of light usage , the player started to
sometimes , it won not read the dvds--the player indicated &quot ; no disc&quot ; in player
i unplugged it and it worked after it <NUM> minute later
then , it doesn not work again , and i repeated the same procedure of unplugging
finally , i sent the player back to rca
since it was still under warranty , all i had to do was pay for shipping
it came back after about a month
it worked , and then i started to see the problem again within a couple of days
i was confused
why does it work sometimes but sometimes it fails to work ? so , i tested it out to see the prob
it appeared that the disc tray motor sounded weak , and being unable to read the disc , i thought , could be due to the fact that rca had provided a weak motor part
i was half right
i removed the plug from the ups/power supply and plugged it directly into the wall
ever since , the player was plugged directly into the wall , it shows no problem
i think i may have found a solution ( for now ) --the difficulty in reading the disc , i concluded , was due to lack of power [believe it or not]
well , if you have the same problem , try unplugging it and have a dedicated power supply for this player
it might work
beside this , the machine is good
it played every single dvds i have ever rented or bought
i have this hooked up to my reciever through toslink ( optical cable )
the sound is excellent--good proportion of sound from center , satellite , rear and subwoofer
it plays cd but it takes a second or <NUM> to skip to songs
basically , don not expect it to play it like a real cd player
it sounded just as good though
the picture quality is excellent
eventhough i don not have an hdtv , i could still clearly see the improvement over the vhs , or betamax tapes
i am getting rid of it now because i want a new and better player that also plays vcds .
this is a simple , no frills , no gimmicks radio
believe it or not , it was hard to find a radio with those qualities
modern radios are , and have tons of &quot ; features&quot ;
i needed this radio for someone who was visually impaired , had severe arthritis , and was well beyond the age of dealing with gadgets
fortunately ( ? ) ge is still in the business of making things &quot ; the old fashioned way&quot ;
to me , the ge brand has always meant &quot ; cheaply made&quot ;
to be fair , it once meant superior quality and innovation , but ge along with general motors and a few other &quot ; super conglomerates&quot ; , took a vacation from quality and innovation in the latter half of the last century
now they are madly playing , and this little radio , even though it is a throwback , is the first sign i have seen that they are making progress
it is a simple am/fm radio
it is a little too bulky , has very nice monoraural sound , and the knobs are a bit too small for arthritic fingers
still , it is just what i needed , and it is the first ge product i have intentionally purchased in over thirty years
either my standards are coming down , or they are actually improving their quality .
this is ok if you just want a cheap , portable radio but the reception leaves a lot to be desired
many am stations that are easy to get on my other radios were on this .
i was looking around for a small radio to have at my desk at work
i figured with a smaller unit , i would save space and not have a very good sound
i was wrong about this unit
i was very pleased to listen to the quality of sound from this unit
<NUM> people that sit near me in my office have enjoyed this radio as well and have ordered one for themselves as well
i highly recommend this product
it is a good price , small , and has a great sound .
i wanted a radio to listen to npr for a few minutes in the morning without putting on the stereo
i did not want a cd or tape player
this is a good little basic radio and i am pleased with it .
i bought this for listening to npr while working on painting and stenciling projects on our backporch
i was pleasantly surprised to discover that it does a good job with music as well as spoken words
i also like the fact that it has a solid , metal antenna instead of one of those thin , whispy wire ones that so interest the feline members of our household ( my husband recently bought a clock radio with one of those antennas -- after two days it was summarily detached and removed to the living room for the <NUM> antenna olympics )
another nice feature is the little compartment in back in which you can store the electrical cord .
this radio might work better if you live in areas with strong radio signals
in the fringe area i live in , it doesn not work at all , whereas the little ten dollar panasonic pocket am / fm radio works quite well .
i needed a cheap radio for background music
all i wanted was decent sound and to receive fm radio
i wasn not interested in playing cds or mp3s
since i do a lot of work around the homestead , i wanted it to be small and easily portable and still have decent sound
this ge radio delivers on all counts
i live rurally but still close enough to town that i can not comment on reception
all i can say is that i get all the radio stations that i want to listen to , the quality of the speaker is plenty good enough for my taste and level of loudness in fm music , and i don not get any frequency drift so that i don not have to constantly fiddle with the tuning knob
it is just a great little radio for a very decent price
the only downside is that the fm antenna is quite flimsy and can be bent if you knock the radio over with the antenna extended .
i bought this radio in order to listen to an am station in my area that is very weak
prior to getting this radio , i couldn not get it to come in on any radio in my house
now , i can get it very strong and clear
the only complaint i have is that the dials on the front for volume , etc
don not seem well made and seems like they could break or come off
since i leave it on the same station and same volume all the time , it probably won not be a problem
it also looks sturdier in the picture than it feels
it is pretty lightweight plastic
but , the only reason i got it was to receive this one station , and it does that job well .
being one of those people that likes to chase am signals , i was convinced that this was a radio i had to have
i was a bit disappointed in some areas , but still see it as something good
this radio is big
once loaded with "d" batteries , it can be used to tone those upper arms during long listening sessions
quality control seems to vary from set to set , but a few things off the bat that i found were awry for my $50 were : 1 ) build quality
the switches and dials seemed on the flimsy side , with the chrome finish easy to rub off
2 ) dial markings
for claiming to be a "dx machine" , both am and fm fequency marks are more for wishful thinking than accuracy
best bet is to find your local stations and the dial with whiteout or tape and the actual frequency by hand
3 ) audio
for using a large woofer , tweeter , and separate bass and treble controls , the audio quality could be better than it is
it still sounds good , but should be better
on the plus side : 1 ) am reception is fantastic
by turning the radio to null signals , i was able to pick up a small local on <NUM> am near rochester , ny , then turn it again to cleanly pick up another station on <NUM> am in salt lake city
the wide/narrow setting helps greatly in picking stations from the weeds2 ) fm reception is quite good
picking up locals and larger 75+ mile stations is no problem for this unit
i didn not realize there were so many fm is around until i purchased this radio3 ) ac power cord
fits neatly in the back of the radio ( albeit a bit cramped ) , and having its own power supply instead of an adaptor eliminates any humming while trying to find faint signals
although not quite as good as its predecessor the superradioii , it does what it is designed to do - allow good reception of am and fm without any bells or whistles to get in the way
if you can find it discounted , then pick one up and listen away
otherwise , there are better choices to be found in this price range .
so great , i bought one for everyone in my family
the ultimate christmas present
great range , clear sound and when plugged in it charges the batteries
incredibly durable too .
for the price , you can not beat this sturdy radio
great sound , and durable
use it in the garage and around the deck and it is got great volumn and clarity
you can not beat the deal that ge is providing
second model owned , had their original model for <NUM> yrs and was so impressed i got a new one .
most radios you can buy have pretty cabinets , nice paint , and will sound pretty good if you are tuned to a station whose radio beams are about strong enough to cook an egg
they are designed to impress you in the big box store , where looks and the sound of the most powerful station in town are all you have to go on
it isn not until you get them home that you find out how miserable they are in performance , trying to pick up that weak station that is the only one carrying the game you want to hear
the ge superadio is a whole 'nother deal
it is just an radio , aggressively avoiding any other features whatsoever
but it is the gold standard of the type
when a radio geek wants to say whether some other set is good on fm and , especially , am , s/he will compare it to the superadio
to give you an idea how good it is ; i live in a area without any really strong am stations
sitting side by side on my couch , a typical 'personal stereo' type radio picks up one am station
a cheap transistor radio picks up three
the superadio picks up 37
i recommend my friends get these as part of their blackout kits
for one thing , it will run about two hours less than forever on its six
for another , this set can pull in am stations at least two , three hundred miles away , in daylight , any time
if your blackout extends farther than this radio is range , you have got more important things to worry about
incidently , it runs off ac also
it switches to ac automatically when you plug it in , switches back to batteries automatically if ac isn not available
sound quality is excellent
it is mono , but it has a good and large speaker and enough audio power to drive it properly
it also has separate treble and bass controls
i give it four stars instead of five for three reasons : 1
some of them don not work
the first one i bought didn not
stations are hard for me to tune toward the upper end of the am band
they are packed very tightly together there , and getting from one to another nearby is fiddly
the "wide" bandwidth is useless to me
there is no radio signal in my area strong enough for it
i have to use the narrow setting , intended for weak and distant stations , for everything
still , it is a heck of a radio for remote areas , for camping trips , or if you want to know how well a radio can work if somebody at the company gives a darn .
a friend of mine had this radio for listening to sports
we live in a small town and have trouble receiving am stations from the city on normal radios
with the superadio , there is no problem
the tuner is sensitive and easy to use , the speaker sounds good , and the dials are tough
i think this radio is a perfect part of anyone is emergency kit
you'd be able to tune in stations from far away in the event of a power outage in your area
so far i have used mostly the batteries for power and they are lasting nicely ( the product instructions say they will last for <NUM> hours of on time )
do yourself a favor and buy this radio , it is a fun toy and a useful tool .
i got this radio to pull in both remote stations , and to have better reception
i also wanted something for emergency purposes in case of power failures/earthquakes , etc
first impression is that this is one big , ugly , heavy radio
that impression never goes away , because it is big , ugly , and heavy
the apparent workmanship , fit and finish , looks like it was put together in the dark , by a monkey , who had lost the instructions
it just looks , frankly , awful
cheap plastic , poorly made ( with all sorts of "color swirls" ) , with chrome paint
about like the interior of a is chevy
it uses no fewer than <NUM> "d" cells
but the radio is so big you hardly notice
most of the size comes from the 6" diameter of the speaker and the enclosure behind it
it probably to about half a barrel of oil to make all the plastic
there is also a very crude perforated metal grate over the speakers
all the knobs and switch *seem* like they will fall of at any moment , and the tuning dial and linear indicator are similarly questionable
it has a handle , and while you can carry it around , it is a "portable" radio in the same sense that the original "beige toaster" 128k macintosh was portable
as far as entertainment products go , this radio is the opposite end of the spectrum from the ipod "nano"
you might think that you will get some pretty great sound from a 6" "woofer" and a about a 3/4" "tweeter
but no - the sound quality , overall , it not very good at all
it always sounds "tinny" and while it is plenty good enough for am voice it is really not much better on fm
but , by golly , it does have absolutely terrific am reception
right away , all the"problem" stations i had before were perfectly clear
with a terk loop antenna , i spent a few late nights trying to see how many of the 50kw "clear channel" stations i could get
with care in tuning the antenna and the radio , i got the hartford , ct , station on the first try
didn not last too long , but i got it
this from *sunnyvale , california*
it is relatively easy to get stations in wyoming and nebraska on good nights
seattle , la , salt lake , no problem anytime , even with the internal antenna
the tuning indicator is nowhere close to accurate and in any case the markings are so crude that you can not reliably set the radio using the existing marks
i just put some paper correction tape on the scale and marked the frequencies with a pencil
one thing that i didn not see in the other reviews , or anywhere else except the instructions , is that the radio is capable of being set to use <NUM> khz bandwidth instead of the usual 10 , meaning you get a lot better sound than normal
the speakers stink , but the reception is better and the incoming information is less compressed
of course you want narrow for listening but if you listen to nearby stations it helps quite a bit
the fm performance is nothing to write home about , hardly any different from any other radio you might buy
it has afc to help control the drift , and it seems to work just fine
but it is a mono radio , and the speaker quality limits the sound quality
it is bad enough that it will wear you out if you listen to music for long
there are tone controls , but no amount of fiddling with the bass and treble will fix it
if you want a fm radio , get the tivoli model one
it is about 3x the price but the sound is about 10x better
it is clear to me that virtually all the price of the ge went into the am receiver part , and the rest of it was compromised to meet the *very low* price
with the huge battery pack , i suspect it will run a very , very long time on one set
of course , it can also use ac
crudity aside , the radio works exactly as advertised , has brilliant am reception , will probably run forever on a set of batteries , and is so inexpensive for the performance that you really can not go too wrong
to clarify , my review is for the *ge* version , not the rca version , which is still big , ugly , and poorly made - and also has terrible performance
the ge version works well , the rca does not
as someone who worked for the ge audio division back when the first superadio was developed , i can attest to the fact that the product was seriously designed as a very high quality piece
the engineers had their ge radio reputations on the line , and the concept of good mono vs
bad stereo obviously had market appeal
over the years , inevitable cost compromise decisions have undoubtedly been made ( i was part of some of these types of discussions as well ) , but when i was looking for a good portable radio , this version was high on the list
we have been satisfied with our recent purchase and would recommend a listen to anyone interested in good reception and sound
one problem is that there are relatively few retail outlets at which to check this out , but that is why we have amazon , right ?
i bought the original version of this radio back in the late 70s
we have had this one for over two years
it is a great basic radio with loud enough sound for shop/work use
we left it in the vegas sun and it melted the case a little
it still works !
this radio does a great job of receiving local channels and picks up am stations from hundred of miles away .
within a couple of hours of unpacking this radio and without an external antenna , i was able to hear and identify five am stations that were each over <NUM> miles away from my home here in mesa arizona : <NUM> in salt lake city , <NUM> miles ; <NUM> in denver , <NUM> miles ; <NUM> in san francisco , <NUM> miles ; and <NUM> in san antonio , <NUM> miles
i should point out that this was in the evening , when radio signals travel best
one station that has always been problematic for me ( kbaq 89
5 fm transmitting from the other side of phoenix ) came in loud and almost perfectly clear
unfortunately , selectivity on this radio is fm band is poor ( ge chose fidelity over selectivity in this case ) , so 90
5 fm in tucson is completely drowned out by 90
3 fm here in phoenix
after opening the unit and replacing the stock if filter with a <NUM> khz filter ( please read the superadio faq on the internet for more information ) , i can now pull in 90
5 as well
thankfully , the radio has a narrow/wide band switch that lets you choose selectivity on the am band : "narrow" for pulling in those stations , and "wide" for getting extra fidelity from closer stations
at $40 , it is hard to go wrong with this radio
the next step up would be a shortwave radio like the grundig s350 ( $100 ) or the sangean ccradio plus ( $150 )
update : i have only <NUM> complaints about this radio : 1
moving the volume control has a big effect on volume at low volume , but a small effect at high volume
because this radio doesn not have a digital pll tuner , it can be difficult to find a specific station when it also picks up so many other stations on the same part of the dial that you weren not looking for .
if you like to listen to am talk radion , sports or news this radio is unbeatable
i have the sony icf sw7600gr and the am section can not hold a candle to the superadio iii
personally i think the tuning and volume pods are smooth and fairly precise compared to what others have found
i am amased that this unit gets the job done for $40
it does what it says
hope this is helpful .
it is very large but does have pretty good sound and reception , i live in an area where some people cannot get half of what i get on this unit
buy again because of performance
buy again
maybe not because of size being so large .
i have owned my ge superadio iii for about <NUM> months now
i'd heard a lot of ( mostly ) favorable things about this legendary series of radios , and had to get one
i am glad i did
here is what i think
strong points : 1 ) great am reception
even during the day it is not difficult to pick up stations up to a couple of hundred miles away
at night , it can be several hundred miles
this radio has an 8" ferrite antenna , and when you hook up an external antenna like the c crane twin ferrite , it really gets good
2 ) very good fm reception ( although i must admit i mostly just listen to am talk radio
) 3 ) big speaker puts out nice , full sound
4 ) separate bass and treble controls
5 ) very long battery life ( 6 ) 6 ) ac cord included ( but not used most of the time
) 7 ) great value
you could easily spend <NUM> or <NUM> times as much to get a radio that doesn not approach this performance
points : 1 ) it is a big radio
it won not fit in your pocket or briefcase , but it is no boombox either
2 ) the analog tuning dial is not very accurate ( as noted by many others
) 3 ) build quality is about middle of the road
( but still good for the price
) 4 ) no presets , no clock , no weather band , no swi currently do not own a c crane radio plus , which i find the superadio iii most often compared to , but it is also 1/3 the price
i own a lot of radios ( more than <NUM> at last count )
i listen to this one almost every day ( for at least part of the day ) , so i think that says something
if you are looking for a relatively inexpensive , but highly appreciated gift for a talk radio fan , this is it
if you are looking for a cool radio for a young person , this probably ain not it
if you are into talk radio , or you want to have some fun with am , then get one for yourself .
this was my third purchase of this model
i had been using these for listening to stations distant to my rural home for several years but this 'new' set didn not have near the range or tone quality of the prior sets that i had purchased over the years
i changed to cc radio plus sets which do what i had wished this ge set would do .
just give me a good am/fm radio that performs
the superadio iii does exactly that ! the am is so potent it is like having am shortwave - so many stations can be found - all over the usa
the first night i ran it through it is capabilities , from nc we were clear receptioned in chicago , miss , cleveland , ny , and other places that didn not identify
great trip
and the fm reception is exceptional too and the sound is clear , rich and full
yes , it is on the bulky side , not many bells and whistles , but for the price , it is a real champ
trying to convince my wife to get another one
when it was suggested she could use that one for outside ; battle won
great radio ! p
if your battery compartment clips on your super superadio <NUM> don not all snap into place , and if you haven not thought of it yet , fold a small piece of paper and wedge it into the 'v' of the offending clip ( s ) and voil&agrave ; , the compartment is closed tightly
now it is a <NUM> star radio !
i purchased this item , then in afterthought read the reviews listed here
so i was prepared for some rickety thing that had parts ready to fall off when you touched it , and a viewfinder that was as accurate as throwing a baseball at the tuner knob
but the promise of awesome reception was all i needed to hear
first off , i work in a building which has a lot of electrical interference
i needed something to get past that
that was my only concern
so it didn not much matter , as long as i could get past the interference
now that you know that , let me tell you about this thing
first of all it is not huge
i am <NUM> right now , so i have seen rickety bulky radio is that would kill if it hit you
this is a nice unit , well sized for the speakers and antenna is in it
second , it is very well built
i tried to pull off the tuner knob to no effect
even the volume , treble and bass buttons nicely placed on the unit can not be removed without some extra tool
the switches are only two function switches , and are well built
granted it doesn not light up , and the tuner bar isn not a lit bar , but who cares , it is very well built
i tried to squeeze the unit to see if i could make it crack , no , it is sturdy
now , for the tuning ability
there is a wide and narrow switch , which can either give you a very narrow tuning area , or a much wider tuning area
a station i listen to at 740am appears on the wide area from <NUM> to about <NUM> on the dial
however on the narrow switch , it only comes in within a few millimeters of where <NUM> is
that explains why people say the tuning was so bad , they had it set to wide
so all things said and done , how did it do against the interference ? now basically i am stuck in an area which is nothing short of several high tower power poles
the improvement was marginal
but to my surprise there are additional am/fm jacks on the back that you can add an additional antenna or signal amplifiers to &lt ; g> i grabbed a power cord , wrapped it around the am port , and between the improvement in tuning , signal grabbing , and the extra antennae , i am getting very decent reception with only a small bit of hissing
this is a very nice radio , well worth every penny i spent on it
hope this review helps
ed williams , colorado springs , co
i have always enjoyed listening to far away am stations at night ( dxing ) and this radio is one of the better ones for that purpose , even compared to much more expensive radios
it is simple to use with a large internal ferrite antenna
i have never connected it to an external antenna ( screws for this are on the back ) or antenna tuner , which i imagine would improve reception
most new radios have digital synthesized tuners and while that adds tuning accuracy , it often adds noise that is bad for dxing
this radio is not the best built and has known quality control issues such as tuning inaccuracies that can be rectified
it isn not tiring to listen to because it has good sound quality due to the large main speaker , tweeter and bass/treble controls
the fm section works very well too
i do not dx fm so can not comment on it is long distance capabilities but it sounds good and holds the stations well
it uses long running d cells but i use the internal ac power supply - the ac cord is permanently attached
there are many reviews of this storied radio on the net you can read so i won not go on and on
it looks like the rca model replaced the ge but i imagine it is the same radio other than the name on the front
i was fortunate to find a superadio ii at a thrift store and enjoy that earlier model as well .
i have owned a ge superadio since 1985
works great
sounds fantastic
pulls in stations from great distance
seems bulletproof
i especially enjoy the old school knobs and dials
they are no- brainers
spin the dial , turn it up
no digging into digital layers .
i have several superadio is , both ii is and iii is
i am not particularly wild about their redesign of the iii is case ( the ii had a tremendous generic radio look to it ) , but the reception and audio quality is about the same
as other reviewers have noted , the dial accuracy is poor , so you have to &quot ; learn&quot ; each superadio is setting , but once you learn where stations are , they stay put
this is a superb radio , with surprisingly good sound and excellent reception
i have one at work , one in the kitchen , and one that i tote around ( to the beach , to the driveway for carwashing , to the court )
versatile , solidly built and nice priced .
i bought this radio in the early nineties to be my night companion
it is showing signs of wear now , doesn not tune like it used to , and the antenna doesn not stand up anymore ( keeps flopping over ) , but the superradio has been more than worth the money , although i don not remember buying it for as much as they want for it here !
if you love am radio and are looking for a radio that has fantastic reception your choice comes down to two radios : the ccradio plus and the ge superadio
these are the best radios on the market for fans of talk , sports , art bell , phil hendrie , etc
which one should you buy ? i have both ( the ge for my office , ccradio for home ) so here is my take on the two
both have nearly equal am reception
at night , you can easily pull in stations from hundreds of miles away ( some say even over a thousand miles away but this depends on where you live )
there the difference ends
the ccradio has a lot of features that i felt i wanted in a radio
it has a sleep timer , accurate digital tuning , automatic timer that turns your favorite show on at a predetermined time , scan buttons , lighted dial , power cord ( not bulky adaptor ) , weather radio ( with auto alert ) , memory buttons , tv audio of the network stations
the only flaw is that it has a grab indentation rather than a full handle
they are a family business and take good care of their customers
the ccradio company loves radio and loves people who share their passion
is it worth the [$$] for the extras ? to me it is
the ge superadio has a rotary - and inaccurate - tuning dial
this will drive you crazy if you do a lot of channel switching
some people tape graph paper to the radio and mark where they found the stations - it is that inaccurate
there is no timer , no alarm , no weather , no tv audio , no lit dial , etc
the sound is better on the ge superadio , though
the ge superadio feels cheaply made and probably won not make it through many beach or camping excursions
the ge superadio is enormously sized - it is the size of a small attache case or tv ! if you only want to pull in one distant station and keep your dial set to that station , get the ge radio
that is all you need
it has great , almost legendary , reception without any bells or whistles
on the other hand , if you love radio , need the extras , change stations a lot , want something sturdily built that will last a lifetime , want to explore the large number of am stations that are out there , go out and order the ccradio with slightly better reception ( see their website to order )
i am a radio person rather than a tv person
i have radio playing all day ( as some people have tv going on all day )
i sleep to radio ( and need that sleep timer )
i would rather listen to a talk show than watch a sit com
i would rather listen to coast to coast , phil hendrie , and rush than watch another rerun of frasier or friends
if you are like me , do yourself a favor and invest in the ccradio
you won not regret it
, the fm reception will be better than you are used to , also
bottom line : the ge superadio is low cost with no extras and big and bulky
the ccradio plus is expensive , has every extra you could want ( except a decent handle ) , more sensitive but does nto sound as good as the ge for music .
the rca superadio is a very sensitive , great sounding radio
it pulls in stations from out of town and out of state , which will expand your listening choices
( and is just darn interesting to boot
) it is a big , heavy unit - more than <NUM> pounds with batteries
not exactly a ipod , but is fine for carting around the house to listen to while you clean up the garage
this isn not a dxing ( long distance radio aficionado ) radio
for that , you would want digital readout and more control over reception characteristics
this is a radio for those those who love the medium , listen a lot , and want a set that doesn not sound cheap and tinny
this can also make a very good home emergency radio
keep it on batteries ( i have easily run it more than <NUM> hours on a set , using it a couple of hours a day ) use it for everyday listening while you get ready for work in the morning or make dinner in the evening
when the power goes out or the alien spaceships land , turn to it to find out what is going on
there are radios that are a skootch above the superadio in reception and sound - the c crane cc radio2 and sangean among them
but the sangean is at least twice as expensive , the cc radio four times so
for less than $50 you can have a radio that will serve you for many years
every household should have one
get it while you can - it seems rca is not making it any more , or have cut back on production - a lot of retailers that stock it are no longer carrying it .
it is my misfortune to live in a "fringe" fm reception area ; the station i regularly listen to is <NUM> miles away
i have tried various combination shortwave/am/fm radios over the past few years and none had better than "" sound on fm
i'd read about this radio for many years and when i saw it on amazon , figured it was worth a try
i have been very pleasantly surprised ! the radio is very large , but has very large speakers that , combined with separate bass and treble controls , produce a very good quality sound
the tuner section is highly sensitive , even on fm
after i loaded the six d cells into it , i have never even plugged it into the wall and it has been used daily for several hours for many months now
the build quality is a little cheesy , but if it weren not it would weigh as much as an anchor
if you want good quality audio and reception at a very reasonable price and don not mind a large portable , this is a winner .
i loved my sriii
solid sound quality , excellent am receptivity ( but only average fm receptivity )
but it wasn not very hardy
i took it camping once , and it was never the same after that
it took several minutes to "warm up" after you turned it on , and then the sound was distorted for several minutes after that
and scratchy sounds came out of the speaker when you adjusted the volume
i figure the radio didn not like the humidity of the day and the dew of the morning .
i bought this radio as a garage/workshop unit for use when tinkering around
i wanted something that had no gimmicks , that plugged into the wall , was analog tuned , so there was no power draw or batteries to worry about when it is off , and so that i know it will last me a long time without an lcd failure or whatnot
this radio definitely delivers
sound quality is awesome , reception is top notch , and it does exactly what i desired it to
not small , trendy or stylish - if youre looking for that , go elsewhere
but for a rugged , quality unit , with good sound from one speaker , you cant do much better .
some products seem to predict their own futures
corning ware was introduced long before anyone even knew what a microwave oven was and it turned out to be the best cookware for the ubiquitous food zapper
now , the ge superadio iii takes its place among such prescient products
your humble communications technician , seeking to hear another human voice while on the job in a computer room , found the superadio iii remarkably well suited to the computer room environment
i had previously brought a grundig yacht boy <NUM> and a sony to work to listen to an am talk radio station , only to find out that what makes them so good for world band ( shortwave ) reception are the very things that meant disaster in the computer room is emi ( interference ) rich atmosphere
being digital receivers , their circuits eagerly plucked from the air the squeals , drones and squawks of the network servers , pcs and pbx system that occupy the room while adding their own synthesizer noise to the weakened signal
i pondered the possibilities for better reception
i could put the radio nearer an exterior wall , crank up the volume loud enough to hear while seated at my desk , and be promptly thrown into the parking lot , since others in the room don not really want to hear the same station
through the interference on the sony came a commercial for the ccradio by c
crane , a tabletop receiver specially designed for long distance reception of am news and talk radio stations ( translation : the speaker ain not so hot for music )
pricey but perhaps worth it
i read a few reviews of the ccradio and another model kept popping up as the undisputed champ of long distance am radio reception , the standard against which other contenders are measured , the one , the only , ladies and gentlemen , let is hear it for the ge superadio iii
wow , i thought , how often i had seen them at walmart and kmart and how often i said to myself , yeah , right , superadio , ha ha
yet , here were some of the sobs who ever twiddled a tuning knob using this radio as the benchmark
i was intrigued
a quick visit to the usual suspects ( best buy , walmart , kmart ) proved fruitless ( &quot ; sorry , if it is not on the shelf , we are out
no , i don not know when we will have more&quot ; )
in desperation , i came to amazon
com , typed &quot ; superadio&quot ; in the search box and there it was in all its &quot ; usually ships in <NUM> hours&quot ; glory , and for less than the best street price
<NUM> ups second day air days later , it was waiting for me at home
i didn not unbox the radio until i was back at work the next day
even before digging into my sausage mcmuffin with egg breakfast , i unpacked the superadio iii , plugged it in and was , indeed , amazed
the interference no longer dominated the signal from los angeles radio station kfi
it was still there , but not as much as on the sony and grundig
the superadio iii is analog tuner is , by its nature , more immune to it
throwing the wide/normal switch to the normal position reduced much of the interference
judicious tuning and adjustment of the separate bass and treble controls brought forth the desired sound while further fading the interference to a tolerable level
thanks to the sound system , the superadio iii delivers more &quot ; presence&quot ; , allowing it to sound louder even though the volume might be lower than on a radio with inferior sound
at the minus end of the scale is the tuning scale itself
the aforementioned station at <NUM> khz appears between the <NUM> and <NUM> markings ( 675 khz ? )
if you do a lot of station hopping , keeping a station list with each is position on the &quot ; log scale&quot ; above the am and fm scales might be a good idea
made in china and imported by thomson consumer electronics , the superadio iii has a feel to its construction and controls
radios do come out of china ( can you say &quot ; grundig&quot ; ? ) but they also cost accordingly
for its price , the ge superadio iii portable am/fm radio does just what you buy it for and will probably continue to do so for many years to come as more and more computer room hermits discover its ability to bring the outside world inside
they can block your access to web radio , but they can not stop you from listening .
i like this radio
pulls in am stations great
has nice sound quality
i have even dropped this on the floor a few times
still works great
very durable
battery life is excellent ! happy with this radio .
it receives and plays mono radio ( am and fm ) exceptionally well
it sounds great , with surprisingly good bass
at 13"x9"x4" , it isn not small
and it it isn not light either , with <NUM> d batteries in it
but i will bet this heft is what makes the bass sound so good
i bought it because i wanted a good , inexpensive , big , portable radio ( i am tired of the huge footprint and squatting look of most boomboxes today )
i wish it had digital tuning , but it doesn not
the analog dial might not be very accurate , but in my experience , analog tuning has *never* been accurate
i have always had to tune by ear rather than eye
features : power switch ( button ) is separate from the volume control
so you won not be wearing out the volume knob every time you turn it on
bass and treble controls
a mono headphone out ( meant for stereo headphones -- you get the same signal in each ear )
easily fills a room with sound
on am , it has an optional "wide" mode which can give you really great sound on some am stations , at the price of selectivity
on fm it has optional automatic frequency control which grabs the nearest strong fm signal ( you may wish to turn off afc for weak fm signals near strong stations )
it has terminals for external fm and am antennas
it has a nice , 36" long fm antenna , and a 20cm internal ferrite rod for am
it has a nice handle on top , the kind that bangs into the fm antenna if the antenna is extended , so be careful
there is no light on the tuning dial
again , you must tune by ear
heavy , however , doesn not necessarily mean hardy
everything is plastic on it except the antenna and the speaker grille
since it is heavy and somewhat tall , i fear the time when it first will fall over
best to treat this radio kindly -- i am not sure how long the switches will last
but for kindly indoor use , assuming you don not like to switch stations often , it is great
what you are paying for here , though , is the reception , which is excellent
the superadio iii is not a tank .
and i bought one for my dad also
the thing i like about it is it pulls in the am stations very well
i listen to a lot of talk radio in the office and the other *cheap* boom box type radios cannot cut through the computer generated rf but this one discriminates and i can hear the stations
also , the large speaker works wonderfully for rich sound better than most stereo boxes
it is also very inexpensive
i would recommend to anyone .
so , if cc crane is listing this along with their awesome collection of mw & sw radios - wouldn not you get it too ? i looked long and hard - crane was ok , but i already had a grundig pe <NUM> and wanted a radio for primarily am reception ( i like to dx from time to time ) ge superradio iii does the trick , and i got it from amazon for 39
00 ! target doesn not even carry it anymore , and sears does for $70
what a ripoff ! thanks to amazon - they paid for the shipping ( got it before christmas ) and came in tight packaging with no problems whatsoever
this is the best radio in the business , i get kgo from sf like a local la station at night - no static like my other units
the ge superadio iii is impossible to beat
long battery life ( 6 d cells ) , superb am sound that can be made even better on strong signals by switching it to &quot ; wide&quot ; bandwidth mode , and sensitivity that allows me to listen to ny and nj am stations during the day at my home in md , using just the superadio is antenna
the only way it could be better would be to have a digital frequency display , but the analog &quot ; dial&quot ; is ok enough once you get used to it
the fm section is no slouch , either
mine picks up a distant station without even extending the antenna
and , the superadio is also one of only two radios i have ever been able to use at home ( near a busy tower ) with no front end overload problems at all
( the other radio is a discontinued model that cost 2
5 times as much--in <NUM> dollars--as the superadio does now
this is , by far , the best radio you can buy for am/fm reception
the am reception is fantastic , with a internal am antenna that can be supplemented with an external antennal for 'dxing
fm reception is so good you don not need the afc function , but is only in monaural
tuning does not drift away from the frequency like so many other tuners
there is also ample room inside the radio to add subcarrier circuits if you are into that sort of thing
the six batteries last for several months and are a boon for snow storms , power outages , and to tune in stations without electrical interference
the power supply is well shielded from noisy power sources
the sound is very rich with a huge range of bass and treble , which is perfect for attenuating static and whine
the speaker is enormous and the radio features a tweeter
the sound quality both on ac and batteries is
the volume and bass/treble knobs on the front are a little too small for outdoor gloved use but that is the only complaint i have
the antenna is easily replaced if damaged
it seems to be impervious to light rain and splashes but is not
i have several of these radios and have given them as gifts
there appears to be some variance in quality between units , such as the maximum volume you can drive the speakers without distortion , but that appears to be due to changing suppliers of the large speaker
some people are bothered by the frequency display not closely tracking the frequency you are tuning , but i don not think anyone really looks at analog frequency gauges anyway
this is an excellent radio and is great when it is on sale
the regular price is excessive , though , even for this level of quality
*edit* in 2010 , this radio is now known as the rca superadio iii
model numbers include rca and rca rp7887
i am listening to the original , reviewed item right now , and i am glad to see the line is still being produced even if it is under the throwback rca brand .
yeah , it is made of plastic
don not throw it down the stairs then
just put it where you want it and enjoy it
now that i have got mine set up where it can pick up stations and i have got the volume and tone set the way i want , all i do with the controls is switch between the same two stations on occasion
so i suspect this radio will last a while
these radios are especially useful if your home office is partially or completely below ground , like in a finished basement
or , if you work in a metal framed office building and you want to listen to talk radio
am signals are directional
you need to find the location of the transmitting tower for the station you want to listen to , and then point the radio toward the tower
that is what i did and i can listen to radio in a place where nobody else can
it is also a good general purpose portable radio for sitting out on your deck listening to the game or music or whatever
it is not as bulky as a "boom box" but it is got better speakers than most portable radios , so it just sounds better in return for a slightly higher price
postscript : in all fairness to those who comment on the build quality , i will say that my radio stays in one place tuned to one channel and maybe tuned to a second channel on occasion
i hardly adjust the controls at all
so , maybe those who are complaining about the construction quality have a point
i am just not using this radio in a way that involves moving it or manipulating the controls much
it has a very easy life .
good sound , good options
a bit larger than you might think from the picture
sound is good , as is reception
i have it on the back corner of the desk as background music .
it is big , it is bulky , and you can not carry it while you are roller blading , but the ge superradio has the best am and fm reception of just about any portable radio on the market , short of a $500 lowe
it is especially valued for its sensitive am reception ( it is a favorite of am broadcast band &quot ; dxers&quot ; chasing distant stations ) but the fm reception is nearly as good
spend some time listening to it in the evening and you willbe amazed how many am stations are out there that you never suspected existed
after i loaned mine to a builder friend working on my house , he ran out and bought one ; his old job site radio just couldn not get his favorite stations
he listens to it at home now , too
for the money there is just nothing else that even comes close .
i have been a radio buff for years , am/fm/shortwave , have tried receivers from level to the $1000+ digital jobs , and can not tell you the number of times i have responded to another radio by thinking "pretty good am receiver , but not quite up to the old superadio iii"if you want the best am reception possible and demand the convenience of digital tuning , get a ccradio for about $150-$165
if you listen in an area that gets poor reception , like a basement , you may need a more expensive receiver that can accept an external antenna
but if all you want is the best am reception and great fm sound at a reasonable price , the matter is simple and clear - get a superadio iii
and by all means run it on batteries - the d cells give the unit a wonderful heft that keeps it stable and even seems to improve the sound somewhat , and are remarkably
hope that helps .
the superradio iii is a one of a kind radio that will get you far better am reception than even the legendary grundig s350
its fm is equal to the grundig s350 and its speaker is even bigger and fuller
i can not overemphasize this speaker
it can fill an entire house
it is the biggest speaker of any radio i own , including my grundig s350
the superradio iii is am is leaps and bounds beyond any radio you can buy
no comparison
and the reason is plain : other radios have a conventional internal ferrite am antenna
the superradio is ferrite antenna is in contrast eight inches
weak points ? well , the cheap build quality and you have to suffer with a less than precise spin dial
also some don not like its huge size
but for the price i can not fault the radio
for strong am/fm reception with a big full speaker than can fill a huge room , look no further
buy a superradio iii for the cost of radios that won not give you as much bang for your buck
at this price point , the superradio iii blows away the competition .
this baby is about the size of a couple of laptops stacked and turned on edge
it is hard to miss almost anywhere you put it , and probably too big to look ok on your desk
but the sound is huge and there is much less am buzzing ( pretty much none ! ) than i have experienced with the other radios i have tried in my house over the years
i listen to just two am stations , so tuning has not been a problem for me
the superadio has a plug coiled out of the way in the battery compartment , so you have it if you need it
and since this is no walkman , you may find yourself able to plug it in more often than you might expect .
really excellent reception
very good sound quality
separate treble and bass controls
i was surprised by the good reception
highly recommended .
i recently recieved this item
the reception is about the same as my grundig s350
i took off <NUM> star because on fm i cant get <NUM> cleary but my grundig can get it better
is it because the antena is too small ? or is it that i need to modify it ? the am reception is good
the sound is better than the grundig s350 ! over all the radio is good .
very sensitive radio on am , widely considered the best buy for the money by far
very popular in prisons because of its daytime distance performance
sound is top rate
dial calibration is poor but you can get used to it
it is exactly as sensitive as the ccradio at $160 with much better sound than the ccradio
lacks only the ccradio is digital tuning
sorry , art bell .
i have spent the last <NUM> weeks trying to get decent fm radio reception in the middle of an office building with significant emi ( electromagnetic interference )
i tried three radios , including the radio shack ( rs ) portable am/fm radio with extended am range , cat# , which is modeled after the ge superadio
( the superadio and the rs / are often compared out on various pages on the internet and have the exact same features
) my goal was to receive my favorite fm station , which is a weaker station sandwiched between two strong stations
the superadio , with the help of a c
crane fm reflect antenna found at
was the only radio/antenna combo that would bring it in for me
( i also tried <NUM> other antennas , including <NUM> amplified antennas ) another nice item is that i get excellent fm reception on almost every channel now
the ability to turn off the auto frequency control seems to make all the difference for my needs
the rs had the same switch , but i didn not notice a significant difference when i turned it on or off , like i do with the superadio
the only thing the rs had going for it was it is sturdier case , but it was more , even on sale
i haven not done much with am , so i can not comment on that
i hope this is helpful .
i only use superadio iii for fm
plusses : ( 1 ) selectivity and sensitivity are excellent , and comparable to the tivoli pal ( which costs over $100 )
( 2 ) the sound quality for the spoken word is quite adequate
minuses : note that to me the only significant minus is <HASHTAG>
( 1 ) the iii is reproduction of music is
i have even tried playing music through up to eight iiis ( yes , eight ! ) to see if the lack of musical sound quality was due to simple lack of amplification ; it is not
( 2 ) both iiis that have stopped working for me did so because the ( silver ) button while appearing to be in the position in fact wasn not low enough to turn the iii on
fortunately one can solve this problem by wedging a dime between the button and the case
( 3 ) should you try to tune to the same station using multiple iiis at the same time ( as i do ) , there is a noticeable variation between iiis in where on the dial that same station appears
considerations : ( 1 ) sounds best when both bass and treble are at halfway on ( that is , if the control were numbered from <NUM> to 10 , it would be at 5 )
( 2 ) the bass control adds more distortion that bass
( 3 ) the headphone jack takes a stereo ( mini ) plug ( even though not surprisingly the sound through the headphones is monaural ) , which i consider to preferable to a monaural jack , because effectively all headphones have stereo plugs
( 4 ) according the the user is manual , that button works only on am , not fm .
if you love a place , you accept it warts and all
the biggest wart i have had to live with is that while i live in a pretty civilized and tech savvy area , santa clara valley , i also live in the crotch of foothills and at the bottom of said holler
for years tv reception was horrible until we got cable
but , radio reception never improved
we went through a half dozen radios attempting to find something that could grab a specific pbs station we enjoyed most , kqed from san francisco
can you imagine hearing garrison keillor over a crystal set ? things changed for the better only after we followed a recommendation in amazon to this ge portable
somehow , i think it is a tuner knob that is a precise as a laser knife and a tuning band that seems a foot and a half wide , we can nail the signal
after that it is a matter of playing with afc , bass , treble and a view other variables to pull in a signal that is not only there but pretty good
the only real drawbacks come from sun spots : when they flaired we could could hear them
and oh , for a while we heard a neighbor use her cordless phone , which was odd and entertaining for a couple of saturdays until we figured it out and knocked on some doors
the only circumstance that changed our way of life with the ge came with internet radio
when the internet has gone down ( it has ) , out comes the ge
if you live without cable or the internet in some fringe reception hell as did we , get this radio
good listening .
this radio compares favorably to my two ccradios
it has a slide rule tuning system , and you can more accurately tune into a specific station
at night , the selectivity switch really shines , as you can tune in distant stations easily , or eliminate the interference
it is a different radio , and i like both this one and the ccradios
for the money , unbeatable
the tuning dial is not at all accurate , but that is no big deal , once you know where the stations are that you want to tune in
i also like the advertised battery life , although i have not tested the longevity of the batteries yet
so i say get one of these even if you are going to get a ccradio
they are both pretty much the best am radios going .
being a former ham radio operator in the 60 is , i appreciate the features ge put back in their "superradio" that used to be standard
the best is the tuned rf stage that pulls in distance stations with ease
second is the dual power feature : a line cord comes built in , and in battery mode , it takes <NUM> "d" cells so they last a very long time
third , two loudspeakers give amazing soundquality and volume
it is hard to believe you can buy this for under $50
00 ! this is a great radio and i will be buying more forchristmas presents .
this is the best sounding radio ever , especially for it is size ! you can adjust the bass &amp ; treble to your liking ! i have the first one i purchased many years ago , it still works perfectly ! i have recently purchased an additional one , it is just as good as the original
it is easy to bring in stations on this radio that don not come in clearly on other radios
this is a solid , sturdy radio , like the ones from years ago
the radio has a full , rich warm sound , from its large speaker
it is hard to believe a radio so compact can sound so big and wonderful !
i bought this a while back for the garage and was fairly disappointed
it uses old tuning technology and the station would continually drift
the sound was ok , but a little bassy
i am guessing a lot of people buy it for nostalgic reasons
i ended up selling it .
first of all , this is a fine radio for am radio reception
but , the radio that i received is bad
intermittently , the volume goes down to nothing
i can hear it only humming
a one year warranty comes with it and i bought mine about two months ago
it is going back but i am afraid that since the problem is intermittent , it won not be fixed
been there , done that
never the less , it is a great radio as far as reception
guess what ? i bought another one today
one for work , one for home use
i am sure i will have to do without the original for a while it is being repaired though
i rate this radio very high for sound quality and reception ( design ) yet very low for quality of the build
, they do have a year warranty unlike most consumer products which generally are <NUM> days
keep the reciept .
this is just a fantastic product
i have owned two for fifteen years and hope they never stop making this model in case i want another
the sound is great , the reception is great , the price ( was ) great ; the durability is great and the battery usage is great
it is all great
it is certainly not "feature rich" but who needs all that nonsense for am and fm radio ? more feature would just get in my way
tip : the radio has a ground screw on the back which i am guessing most people don not use
after hooking up a long wire outdoor antenna , i noticed that what really helped am dx reception was the ground ! i bought a grounding rod from radio shack to isolate the radio from the noisy house wiring system
( i pounded in the rod in the ground outside the house
) that really helped ! so much so , that i removed the wire antenna and now only use the ground .
i ordered one of these right here on amazon back in jan 2004 , my specimen was probably manufactured in 2003
i should use it more than i have , but it still works very well
of all my other radios , only the old panasonic &<HASHTAG> ; &<HASHTAG> ; model ( ? ) can shade it on am , and the difference is *very* small , at best
on fm , the extra long whip antenna really helps here in the , and it does very well , if not quite up to my little grundig g8 with dsp
sound from the big speaker is excellent
recently i have begun using it late on sat nights to listen to <NUM> am from st
louis- a long way from ne texas ! fades in/out a bit less than my best smaller radios on that
mine even has a fairly accurate tuning scale- tunes <NUM> wsm with the needle centered on the &<HASHTAG> ; 6&<HASHTAG> ; of &<HASHTAG> ; 650&<HASHTAG> ; , <NUM> woai with needle on the &<HASHTAG> ; 2&<HASHTAG> ; of &<HASHTAG> ; 1200&<HASHTAG> ; - certainly too close to try & modify
battery life is looong , too- manual states about <NUM> hrs on <NUM> alkaline
want to use ac instead ? power cord & transformer are , no wall wart to get lost
warts ? power switch seems a little fragile , no light for the dial
some will miss a tuning led lamp , and though it will handle headphones , no fm stereo through 'phones
best testimony i have seen was from someone near new orleans who had no power for weeks after katrina , all local radio stations were knocked , he used one of these as his primary radio to get news & info over am stations
i have read lots of reviews stating that the later versions sold under the rca name are problematic
maybe so- but if you can find one of the ge models at a reasonable price somewhere- and you like radios- my advice is get it quick before someone else does !
i just purchased this radio
it has an excellent reception comparable to portable radios that cost over [price] , and the quality of sound is very good
pros : - reception quality on both am and fm bands ; - has a power cord , may use batteries as well
- attractive price for the quality you get
cons : - a bit heavy , i assume primarily due to speakers ( it has two , one of which is quite large ) and power adapter ; - cavity in the back to hide the thick power cord can barely accommodate the cord ; i managed to back it back after several tries
- vernier ( ) tuning and no ability to stations ; at the same apparently due to excellent reception , dial range for stations is very large , so tuning to a station is not a problem at all
- power adapter makes a constant humming noise that at lower volume levels can be heard within ft form the radio ; i assume this is not a problem when using batteries .
i am not going to repeat all previous reviewers on excellency of am and fm receiving
it is all true
but quality of product is just horrible
look , i formerly lived in ukraine and soviet union and to tell you the truth i haven not seen such horrible finish and quality in soviet portable radios
quality or a lack of it is just appalling
the tuning knob will fell off very soon
there is no soft material under battery battery rattle ( i put some paper inside it cured rattle )
i understand this product made in china , but look you can buy sony , grundig , or any other quality product and they are made wonderfully in china , as a matter of fact , almost everything nowdays made in china
it is not a question whether or not something made in china it is a matter how good it made there
this radio is obviously was made in garage in china
just tell me why , but why there is no light on tuning scale , how hard it was to put simple connection to simple bulb
ge seems not to care about quality of their product at all
i wouldn not ever buy this product for looks
it looks awful , but reception on am is excellent , yes it is .
it is sensitive and because of it range , you can tweek in stuff from far away , and then flick a switch and pow even more range
had a halicrafters <NUM> band radio beck when i was a kid , it had range with the external antenna , but this is a very good radio , under battery power or plugged in
good buy for the price !
that is right - excellent am radio
good for news and talk radio , good for music of the 70 is also , a true of the 70 is impression
: - ) for am programming , this is my choice
however , for fm and concert music , i go with trevolie model one , it is simply amazing and inspiring
and for an all around portable radio , the grundig s350 is my choice , it is much more refined and functional
all three are keeper in my book
in my search of a portable radio , i bought all three within two month time frame and am very happy with the flexibility and quality i get
follow up to my initial review back to august 2004 , my superadio is still on the first set of battery and working nicely , no trouble whatsoever
so far , i am convinced if it does not pick up the signal ( both am and fm ) , pretty much that is it ; the station is out of range
i use it mostly for am , yet , fm reception is just as good
by itself and tuned at a moderate leve , the sound quality is ok
overall , a nice radio and well worth the money .
work well for signing things
this stylus is metal with a high quality plastic tip , thus giving it some needed weight and smoothness when compared to palm is pure plastic &quot ; cheapo&quot ; stylus
the end unscrews and reveals a pin to reset your palm in the rare case it crashes
a small purchase that makes a big difference .
why are you even reading the reviews ? they get lost easily , they get easily left at the office , and they are inexpensive
go get some more .
these stylus' are much better than the generic plastic one that comes with the palm iiixe
these stylus' are much more rugged , and reliable and are built to last
you should definately replace mr
default stylus
the reason being that these new metal stylus' will improve your grafitti skills ! another convenient feature of this stylus is that the top unscrews to reveal a reset tip
( much better than hunting around for a paper clip to reset your device ) pick up these stylus' if you haven not already , they are really good ! certainly worth replacing the plastic one considering the price
plus you get <NUM> of them in case you ever lose one .
exactly what i needed to use the touch screen on a alpha dc power rectifier
also works with a jdsu 8000 .
i am not one to complain much but i hate old products that get mixed in with the new
this is one i should have returned but missed my chance due to events happening
this was ordered by mistake
i am sure it works just not for any of my devices .
my new iiixe came with a flimsy plastic stylus which was not particularly easy to grip or manipulate
these replacement styli are plastic and brushed metal , prividing a much better grip and improved heft .
so you have got a palm , and you consider yourself a decent graffiti artist , a whiz with the stylus ? not if you are still using the cheap stylus that likely came with your palm
these replacements ( a set of three ) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand , making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable
the hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset ( and the horror of the hard reset ) again
it is a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one , as i found when i left one at the office , gave one to my girlfriend , and lost the one i had in my case
argh ! you will never willingly go back to the stylus again
the price is right , so buy one , buy two , buy one for the dog ( not really )
don not tap without it !
the original stylus that comes with the palm iiixe is a simple lightweight plastic device that you will want to replace immediately
simply put , this stylus is a bargain , and should be the first accessory item you add to a palm iiixe purchase
these have a metal barrel that makes it feel like a real writing instrument and not a toy
put one in your iiixe , one in your briefcase or purse , and maybe one in your car , and you will always be covered
read the other reviews here and you will see that most of the owners agree - get this and you won not be sorry .
the black molded plastic stylus that came with my palm iiixe was lightweight , functional
and scratched my screen rather quickly , thanks to some excess flashing near the tip
these metal styli don not exhibit that problem
the extra weight also &quot ; feels better&quot ; in a way i can not describe otherwise
( it is not that much heavier , but it does feel more comfortable in your hand
) the best feature , though , is that unscrewing the top gets you to a reset tool
unfortunately , especially with software , you will need to reset your palm on occasion , and having a handy reset tool saves on batteries .
you never know when you are going to need it
a good traveler always knows where his towel , err , stylus is at all times !
not the same as the original
fits too small so had to put tape around it to make it fit .
if you have a palm , you are going to lose the stylus
if you are like me , you are going to lose one about every four months
so you are going to need replacements
if you haven not lost your original stylus yet , wait--you will
or , better yet , toss the original stylus in favor of one of the replacement stylii
the cheap metal stylus that comes with the palm iii is hard to use because it is too light
( i have carpal tunnel syndrome and found the original equipment stylus aggravated it because of how hard i ended up gripping the stylus
) these replacement stylii are a heavier metal , which is easier to hold and considerably more accurate
highly recommended .
trust me it does not work
i have tried it on all rooms , anddoes not transmit
waste of money
if you want an item that does work i have found the sbc wireless to be the best and you can buy it at amazon or walmart .
i bought this a few years ago and works well for the phone connection that my dvr is require
i have had no problems with this unit .
i purchased this product to provide phone connection to my dss receiver
i do not have a phone line in that area and this seemed like a nice solution to the problem
this is a low data rate application and voice quality is clearly not of concern
the product was easy to install and worked perfectly for this application .
i got this for a friend to use on his dial up modem , and it works flawlessley
great buy .
used a panasonic 2
4ghz phones as the extension and it would not get a dial tone
plugged in a simple corded phone and it worked just fine
so , beware , the operation of the unit is uncertain .
these worked ok for a while , then they died
reset button and repeated attempts to connect failed
not recommended .
this device did not work for me
they use the electrical wiring in your home to send and receive the sound signal
that electrical wiring can also carry a lot of noise from electrical appliances and even from light dimmers
in an apartment the noise is increased by all the electrical devices used by the neighbours , so in my case it was very noisy making this adapters a total waist of money
i found a similar device that uses 2
4ghz and it works great for me
but the device called dualjack could potentially interfere with other 2
4ghz signals like a computer wireless land or even wireless phones , so far i have not had any interference
you have to try them and see what works for you

if you need to add a phone extension without cables or need to hook up a fax machine this product is ok , but for modems and internet connections , your speed will go dooooooown to <NUM> or even less .
despite several attempts ( including changing locations ) i was unable to get a strong enough dial tone for my fax
i have seen that a real wireless 2
4 mgh phone extension system is available in europe but not in the us , where i only find powerline systems .
i purchased this to add an extension phone line into my bedroom
because of old wiring in the house , the phone jacks in my bedroom stopped working and no dial tone was available
while i use a cordless phone with the main base in the other room , i needed a phone jack so my tivo could dial out and get programming information
when set up , the two units would be in separate rooms with a hallway between them
i purchased this unit from a store after the clerk assured me the range and quality was good enough that i could use it almost anywhere in my house
after a lot of effort , i find the unit to be nearly worthless
the range is very limited
i made sure that the only obstructions between the transmitter and base were the two walls between the two rooms and nothing else ( furniture , electronics , etc
) were in the way , yet there was no dial tone
i moved the receiver so that only a single wall was between the two units , and i did get a dial tone , but had such a bad signal that voice calls would be painful to listen to
i couldn not imagine using it with an electronic device ( like a modem or tivo ) that sends data
i got the best signal when both devices were in the same room and within <NUM> to <NUM> feet of each other
needless to say , with that kind of configuration , it is easier and cheaper to just run a long phone cord along the baseboard .
the headline on this review says it all
i am not mechanically gifted in the least but this rca wireless phone jack did not test my technical acumen
( thank goodness )
it is easy to set up , just click in a couple of leads , plug it in the wall and voila ! , instant dial tone , good to go and bob is your uncle .
i installed this product and tried several a/c outlets , but the phone always produced backgound hiss and static
within a week it quit working and i could not get the transmitter light to come on after that so returned the unit for a refund
i got a different brand that does not have the background noise
i hope it lasts .
i use the rc926 to add an extra phone jack for my directivos and standalone directv receiver
all three receivers are split off from the extension jack and i have never had a problem with the units making the required service data call
edit : i also have dsl but use 2wire filters ( not the generic filters provided by verizon ) for greater clarity
a filter has to be placed between the jack and the wireless base unit for the wireless extension unit to function properly with dsl
note : tivos and directivos do have modems so rios' title header is somewhat misleading
but the facts in the body of the review are correct
per page <NUM> of rca is manual ( which is available on their website ) : "note : the maximum baud rate for the wireless phone jack is 14 , 400
best results , however , will be experienced at 9 , 600
" this limitation is why i knocked off a star
so yes , i would not recommend that you attempt to surf the internet using this jack or use it for any purpose where a high baud rate is important
but the phone jack is perfectly fine for voice , fax , and satellite receiver use .
i used to have a second phone line in an upstairs room that i used primarily for faxing and occasional phone calls
when i got rid of that line , i bought this wireless phone jack so that i could use my main phone line in the upstairs room without paying the phone company the considerable cost of running new wires
the product does work even though the base station is connected to a phone jack in a room that is not only downstairs , but is also separated by multiple doors and walls from my upstairs room , which is in another part of the house
this unit has enabled me to use my phone/fax machine to send and receive faxes without any problems
making phone calls is a different story
although there is always some "noise" on the line , sometimes it is so minimal that i can easily make a phone call and carry on a conversation
but other times the "noise" is so loud that it is not possible to use the phone to call someone
bottom line : faxing is always possible , but voice conversations sometimes are not
you need to decide what your priorities are before you buy this .
this is only the 2nd item i have returned in yrs of buying on amazon
it just doesn not work well enough to keep
you can make an outgoing call on it , but it will not ring for an incoming call
no caller id , no ring , no nothing
outgoing call sound quality is terrible--static and clicking noises
i tried several different jacks , outlets and locations
i wanted to make sure the units weren not too close , nor too far from each other
tried different jacks , plugs , etc
made sure it was plugged directly into an outlet
nothing made any difference
outgoing call quality was poor , incoming would never work nor ring
returned item .
this product does not have caller id and makes a hissing sound that is irritating
i bought it from buyaccessories , who weregreat with customer service and refunded my purchase
i will buy from them again
it is not their fault the product is mediocre .
this little gizmo works fine for most phones but it does not work with phones with caller id
keep that in mind when you are considering a purchase
works great with the others
overall a nifty little device .
i bought this a few years ago and works well for the phone connection that my dvr is require
i have had no problems with this unit
this was an expansion for rca rc926 .
these rca wireless connectors are okay for basic phone conversation over short distances
don not bother trying to use them for data such as with tivo or a computer
they simply won not work
they use a fairly old technology and even basic phone conversation can result in interference from other devices in the house .
i thought i ordered both receiver and transmitter , had to by phone
they told me they would send me a r
by email and i never got it now i am stuck with two orders .
this device did not work for me
they use the electrical wiring in your home to send and receive the sound signal
that electrical wiring can also carry a lot of noise from electrical appliances and even from light dimmers
in an apartment the noise is increased by all the electrical devices used by the neighbours , so in my case it was very noisy making the rca adapters a total waist of money
i found a similar device that uses 2
4ghz and it works great for me
but the device called dualjack could potentially interfere with other 2
4ghz signals like a computer wireless land or even wireless phones , so far i have not had any interference
you have to try them and see what works for you .
i bought this product to connect my directv line
there is 25ft
between sender and receiver
all i get on my phone is static
i have tried several locations in the room
i have tried to contact rca ( thomson inc
) all you get is a recording , you can not get a live person
you can not even talk to a technical support
don not waste your money !
this product does not work with my base unit at all , even though they are both the same brand
sales rep was very courteous and stated that it was a defective unit
however , is rca quality control bad enough to where they get units that absolutely don not work ? very inconvenient for customers
it also seems to me that they have a huge compatability issue w/ base units and extensions from the amazon reviews i have read
do your homework and i would advise that anyone looking for a wireless phone jack save up a little more money and buy a better brand .
this extension requires one of the following wireless phone jack systems : rca rc 926 , ge ge926 or d916
( per packaging )
it does not work with the rca rc 930 , which amazon is bundling with it
don not buy it with the rc 930 !
excellent product while it lasts
i have yet to have one of these last for more than four months
i usually purchase a few at time so that i always have a spare for when ever it no longer works
because the telephone is so uncomfortable to hold , a handset is a necessity and this is the best one to have
unfortunately , it does not last for too long .
i have owned several of these items and all were inferior and really useless
this unit fits well and the sound quality i hear is superb
i have asked those i have talked with how they hear me and they say it is also loud and clear
guess i'd have to give it a total of five stars .
i used it once and my sister long distance couldn not even tell
i have used plantronics plastic microphones at work and the sound quality was better the sister said
it was weird to have a very lightweight headset on my head -- instead of a phone clenched between my head and shoulder
but ! i knew it was something i could learn to love quickly
the mike was not quite long enough however
call me a big mouth ! it didn not reach around in front of my face
it was very much to the side
just in the peripheral vision
again something i was sure i could get accustomed to
the next time i plugged it in , if i touched the cord or the phone or moved there was massive crackling
i gave up after a few more tries
i should of sent it back ( amazon is super about replacing items ) but didn not really think about it until the warranty had expired
i am ready to try again
but this time will read all the reviews before purchasing .
there appears to be an engineering flaw in the plug connection for the microphone wire
i have two of these units where you can hear the caller but they cant hear you
this is too bad because the sound quality is very good for the price .
the only thing it was missing is the volume slider with mute button
i had it on the previous uniden headset
otherwise it works great and i am happy with the <NUM> i bought .
headset is comfortable and works well
i can still get things done around the house while talking on the phone and this is a great help
only drawback is that microphone is mounted on plastic mouth piece and this limits adjustability for the distance from mouth to microphone .
this is a great headset
the volume is just a little lower than i would have expected but overall i am very happy with this headset and i would buy another if i had the need .
i decided i wanted a headset so that i could talk on the phone while doing work or cooking around my house
i looked at both this uniden headset and the at&amp ; t one that is also sold on amazon
even though i read the reviews on here that said this headset can easily break i went ahead and bought one for cheap off the amazon
com outlet
i used it for a few months and was pretty happy with it
it was comfortable on my head , easy to adjust , sounded good , and i never got any complaints from people i was talking to
then it broke
so now i am about to shell out some more money for the at&amp ; t headset and i figured i'd share my new found wisdom with everyone else .
i purchased this for my wife to use when she speaks to a certain someone each night and puts the phone on the speaker system
the only probem is that my wife wears one of these all day and was not happy to wear this at home
i used it a few time when i work on my computer and need help
sound quality is fine
if i had to do over , i might have looked into a wireless
don not get me wrong , it works fine
it is that i don not really need it with my speaker phones .
this is the worst headset i have ever owned
i bought so many of them over the years i don not remember anymore how many went bad
at least 10
the reason i keep buying them is because all other manufacturer headsets don not work well with a uniden cordless phone
uniden requires a specific impedance , otherwise voice quality is not good
calling uniden is worthless
they are of no help
i actually think they design the tip of the connector to break because each one has stopped working properly where the wire connects to the 2
5mm plug
i am not buying anymore uniden phones or headsets .
this is the 5th wireless phone jack i have purchased
it worked for maybe <NUM> months then died
tried to reset but it would not connect
do not buy this product
used this for all of about <NUM> minutes
couldn not connect at all
gave one star only because i couldn not give 0 .
unfortunately this wireless modem jack had a substantial amount of line noise
i was able to connect to the internet at 1/10th the normal speed due to the insufficient connection
i will give this to another family member to try in a newer house .
i read the reviews about how there is too much static when used on a phone line
i wouldn not know
i only bought this thing to get a credit on my dish network bill
( they don not tell you they charge per month if you don not have it plugged into a phone line , just that you get a credit each month if you do
) for one year , it doesn not pay , but for a contract , it pays itself off after the first year
so , since i didn not have any phone lines anywhere near by , this thing works just fine for what i need .
this worked well to transfer a caller id signal to an area where i have a cable box and tv
this was very good for my needs , but i did listen to the line and it was noisy when using some outlets
i also had a tough time finding two different outlets that would "talk" to each other and transfer the caller id signal ; but after a lot of trial and error it seems to work flawlessly .
i have used the rca rc930 wireless modem jacks to create a poor man is wireless network in my home
it works ! and i love it ! i can now sit in any chair of my house , surf the web , and print ( across the room ) to my wireless hp <NUM> bluetooth printer
my system consists of two sets of rca wireless modem jacks ( a sender and receiver unit in each set ) -- one set for the upstairs and one set for the downstairs ( which appear to be on separate circuits and are not connected ) ; a 3com bluetooth pc card for my laptop ; and a hp <NUM> bluetooth printer
i now use my laptop in the following manner : first , i plug the rca receiving unit into the wall outlet nearest where i want to sit ; then i turn on the printer ; and finally , i extend the little blue antenna ( how cute ! ) on the laptop is pc card -- and i am all set to go ! the rca modem jack is good up to 56k , which is ok since i don not have internet cable or dsl service in my area
but i will gladly mobility for speed any day
here is why
my desktop computers ( old and new ) are in my upstairs bedrooms -- where i can not use them when my family is sleeping
they are also far away from where my family spends most of its time -- and that is downstairs by the tv is
with the rca wireless modem jacks , i can now access the internet --- while watching tv with my family ; and i can surf the net long after everyone has gone to sleep -- when internet speeds are fastest
the connection is fairly clean ( free of static ) ; and the transfer speed is nearly as fast as if i had accessed the phone jack directly
i have gotten very used to sitting in my favorite chair and surfing the net
when cable or dsl eventually come to my neighborhood , i guess i will have to set up a wireless network in my home ( for a lot more money ) -- in order to maintain my mobility
until then , i will use the next best thing -- rca is wireless modem jacks
they are great !
the people who rated this highly only used it for tivo
i have vonage and i wanted this to put my telephone in a place different than where my vonage router is in my apartment and it works horribly
i spent over an hour trying multiple different connections and distances and came to the conclution that the only way it works is if they receiver is in the same jack as the sending device
so disappointed ! i got it for $35 so im not that mad , but still i paid for something i should not have bought in the first place .
had a small setup problem ( i needed to do the security setup before it would let me hear a dialtone ) , otherwise i use it on my tivo and it works just fine ( so far )
update ( several years later )
this unit is really lousy
i called tivo for an unrelated issue one day , and the guy on the phone said "you are using one of those wireless modem things aren not you" - he could tell because my dialup pattern was an abbatoir
i didn not know because the tivo managed to mask the failures , but after trying several online tivo updates , i got to finding out how much this really doesn not work
i have a series <NUM> tivo now and am using an 802
11 network which is infinitely better and faster .
it was difficult to set up , and it does not work with the rc920 extension that amazon is combining with it , but it does ultimately work .
i made the mistake of buying the rca wireless phone jack to connect my tivo downstairs in the living room where i don not have a jack
it did not work
once i finally what i needed , i bought the rca wireless modem jack
it works perfectly and i haven not had any problems .
i bought this for a spare bedroom where we did not have a telephone jack
installation was a snap and it works great
sound quality is awesome and in addition you can use it to connect an access point router to expand the reach of your network .
the wireless modem/phone jack idea is a great one , but it rarely works the way it is intended
whether it is interference from other electronics , old house wiring , or any number of things , it tends to have a poor signal resulting in a bad connection
if you are using this for either a modem , security system that requires a phone line , or a telephone jack , it is likely not going to give you the results you want
my recommendation would be to go ahead and have a phone drop and jack installed and call it a day
it may be a more expensive option , but it is by far the best one .
i tried this to use a fax two floors above my vonage phone modem with fax outlet and performance was very spotty
sometimes it worked , but many times i'd get a "poor line condition" error message when i tried to fax
i finally broke down and ran telephone wire to that room through the walls
it was a pain , but i finally got my fax to work all the time .
i have used this wireless phone jack system to connect a directv receiver for over <NUM> months ( and for three months , a tivo ) without a problem
the stations are about <NUM> feet apart with a wall and furniture in between , but i have not had connectivity issues
i have two wireless networks ( b and g ) in the same area and have not had the interference problems others have mentioned
that said , my parents tried using the same system in their home and got lots of static and dropped modem connections over a <NUM> ft
installation with no other wireless networks , so the system seems to be somewhat picky .
i am shopping around for wireless speakers to use in a conference room at work so that i can pull in a few folks attending by teleconference
i am sorry , but i just don not think there is any way i could set this up on my conference table without some of my colleagues having to work very hard to conceal a grin , or even a snicker
the problem , to put it delicately , is that the antenna is , well , er , it is um , kinda
well , just look at it ! a possible distraction .
works ok
not worth the price tag new
i purchased refurb for half the price of new
sounds is not cd quality
sound is similar to fm radio as the device broadcasts over a fm signal
i live in a condo and placed <NUM> speaker in each bedroom and hooked the unit up to my stereo in the living room
now i can listen to my comcast music choice and cds thru out my home .
i purchased these speakers about a year ago
if you'd like to know what your likely useable time is with these speakers feel free to use this example
i am on amazon right now buying replacements ( another brand ) for these that have completely failed
they worked fine at first , then got fuzzier
one quit completely tonight , no power
the other still "works" with lots of fuzz
i find myself the signal a lot
time for a replacement
if you intent to use wireless speakers spend some extra bones and get a different brand
i am trying the acoustic research now
they supposedly have better range
don not settle for cheap unless you have to
you will probably be replacing them in a year if your patience lasts that long ! don not say we didn not warn you !
i got these for christmas one year and had a really difficult getting good sound out of them
i wanted to use them for my pc to play music around the house
at first i would get very soft sound and sometimes no sound at all
i shelved them for a while and then decided to try them on my pc again with a soundblaster <NUM> sound card
excellent sound
these speakers are not for the impatient person
i do have the transmitter sitting on the top floor on a high shelf so that it can get go transmission
the transmitter can not be surrounded by anything
i can get a good <NUM> ft out of the speakers
then i start losing signal
there are times that i get a beeping sound of them
for some reason that does subside
i do recommend them for the price
beware it might take some time to find the right niche for them .
i bought two and use them in different parts of the house to listen to my sirius satelite radio
i can walk around the house and listen to either howard or the rolling stones channel through out , using one boom box
there are a few things to keep in mind if you want to get full use of these
* a ) * set the volume going into the transmiter higher
2 ) low volume in will cause popping and fading
very low volume in will for some reason cause the transmitter to shut down
2 ) higher volume in will allow you to lower the preamp volume on the speakers and play with less distortion and lower noise level
when you increase the volume on the speakers , you are amplifying the noise as well as the music
makes sense , right ? b ) the power cord is also part of the antenna , so its location and position can be adjusted to improve reception
i used little plastic wire ties to afix the cord to speaker stands
the cord runs straight down like a verticle antenna
c ) the speaker is still a radio reciever and subject to interferrence
you can adjust the frequency on the transmitter and on the recievers ( speakers )
fine tune them for the best reception in your location
this may take a few adjustsments
remember , cellphones , wifi etc can all interfere ! i tried plugging the transmitter into my stereo is headset jack , but it didn not work well , because the output was too low
i am going to cut the plugs off of the y adapter or make an adapter with bare wires and try using them as the rear ( effects ) channel of my home theater
i love these speakers and use them everyday
they could be a little better , but i still love them ! i'd give them <NUM> stars if they were a little louder , a little better tone wise and the reception range was a little better
you'd get 150' in an open feild or gymnasium , not my odd shaped house
but for the money , they are a great value ! my house is made concrete & steel and has metalic tinted glass all over , so wireless stuff doesn not work the greatest
with my windows closed & the tranmitter on my patio , i get about 30' with occaisional drift
your house might be better
i am going to buy another pair because i see that they are discontinued and these sound better than the newer ones
i am also concerned that the new ones may have differnt frequencies , which is a good thing if you want to use more than one pair at a time , connected to different inputs
better hurry up and buy now , before i get buy all !
liked the reception of this vs
the garmin unit i had previously
but soon learned that maps are the way to go
i upgraded to a map330 soon after trying the 315 .
having spent <NUM> hours with the magellan <NUM> on a camping weekend in arizona is mountains , i can say that the unit is all that is advertised
the manual is cryptic , but once you get used to the customizing menus and <NUM> available navigation screens , the rest is pretty intuitive
i was able to create a waypoint , walk half a mile away in the woods and return to within <NUM> feet
it works surprisingly well even in a rather heavy forest
it was showing an estimated rms positional error of only <NUM> feet at one point ! routes are given in 1
foot increments when you are within
1 miles of your waypoint ( with the updated software you can download from the magellan website ) ! as long as you keep moving , the compass feature is quite good
it even displays the sun and moon locations versus the compass dial
nice screen , plenty of options and quite accurate
when used in your car , it tracks your speed to
1 mph , with updates given each second
if you are a hiker or hunter or fisherman or gizmo lover , this is a nice addition
i suspect on an open lake , this would be super for locating favorite fishing spots .
i have had my gps for about a year now , and love it , but i have <NUM> problems with it , the interface is very difficult to use and tedious to search for a city or road
by the time i find the place im trying to get ive passed it and gone another <NUM> miles
also , mine was working fine when suddenly one day i turned it on and it said it had no maps and i needed a upload
so i downloaded the latest patch for it , and tried uploading with no success
i have gotten a number from magellan to return it , but lost the number ( actually my dad did ) so im returning it : ( but i must say it was great while it worked , and the tech support is fast and reliable .
this is my first gps unit and i could not be more pleased
it is simple to use and easy to carry
i have used it to mark civil war battle sites and to find bench marks
it takes me right to the bench marks
if you are looking for a good unit , the <NUM> is the one you are looking for .
screen small
hard to read while driving
battery eater
i use the dc adapter , however
no maps
not enough contrast on screen
with sunglasses while driving , can not see screen
tiny print on &quot ; goto&quot ; destination
impossible to read while driving
good , quick operation once you learn it
does everything it says it will
i like it except for the above things .
i purchased the gps <NUM> in december after using another brand for five years
the gps315 represents a big improvement with better , quicker satelite acquistion , a compass screen that is ingenious allowing the user to use the sun or moon to correct bearing
this way the user is not having to pull out a compass to check bearing
additional pluses are its small size and light weight using only two aa batteries lasting up to <NUM> hours
if weight is a concern , that is big
my previous unit used four and lasted five hours
problems : the manual is as sorry as it can get
it barely covers trackroute , track history , backtrack , and reverse route
these are major important features left to the user to figure out
i have yet to figure them out consistently
with track history there seems to be an ability to set a scale , but what scale ? nothing tells me
is it how often it records a waypoint in history ? i have emailed the company with questions twice , called once ( had to leave a voice mail because they were not taking calls ) , faxed once
heard nothing from their customer
i wrote them yesterday to give them my thoughts
oh yes , my gps <NUM> crashed and had to be replaced last week after it was three weeks old
glad i wasn not in the middle of 40 , 000 acres
you can not zoom in on a waypoint if it is very far away from your current location
actually to do so but you have to set a scale of
1 or
2 and pan &amp ; scan to it
if is is <NUM> miles away , you can imagine how long that could take .
this kit is absolutely horrible
first off , the cloths it comes with aren not at all
they totally scratch the cd
the "step 1 : scratch removal" is not scratch removal at all
it is supposed to sit for <NUM> minutes , then you wipe it
i let it sit overnite once and the scratch was still there
after you apply that junk , the instructions say to apply "step 2 : cleaner , polisher , and sealer"
this stuff is practically water
it doesn not work at all
after you do that the cd should be like new
i don not think so ! the holder that you put the cd on while you are cleaning it is too flimsy
the only good thing that i use the "scratch remover" for is small scratches on my digital camera , cell phone , psp , and other electronics
do not buy this unless you like ruining cd is
last word : i hate maxell .
after reading the reviews on here i was hesitant to use the product i had just purchased
but i figured what could i lose - it was already skipping and if this didn not work , i'd just buy a new copy
well i am here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important , forget it
the cd was left with more scratches than before ( the "protective" pad actually makes scratches worse than a paper towel
) and it is just a horrible product
i followed the directions to a t
thanks maxell for wasting my money and my time .
i have a couple dvds that had relatively small scratches on them , but deep enough to stop playback and i was able to get them to work correctly
it did take a couple applications , but the sections where the dvd would stop and shut off , now play continuously through
make sure to follow the directions and wipe as the instructions say and the disc will work fine after everything dries .
i bought this repair kit so i could watch a rental movie
it had quite a few scratches and was skipping during the early parts
after i was done , i had even more scratches and the movie skipped in the exact spot it did before .
i bought <NUM> of these kits hoping they would work
i have found them absolutely useless at $10+ per kit
i will continue to search for a product/system that really works .
been using this stuff for a couple years
works great for me
i use it different than the instruction
find a flat surface , lay a bundle of tissue on it , place the disk scratched face up
place a couple drops of <HASHTAG> abrasive on the disk and immediately start wiping with some pressure radially outward ( you don not have to wait <NUM> minutes )
keep working your way around the disk until the solution is dry ( about <NUM> minutes )
spray once with <HASHTAG> , and using a clean tissue , continue wiping very gently radially outward until <HASHTAG> dries
try the disk
if it doesn not work , repeat all the above until it does
this really does work , but it can take some elbow grease and repeated tries depending on the severity of the scratches
i have had a lot of scratched disks , and i haven not found one yet that i couldn not fix with this .
this product is crap
i followed the instructions to the tiniest detail ( i am a very methodical person ) and it didn not remove the scratch that my dvd has and it added several more
i read other reviews of people who had a good experience by twisting the instructions , but i am not willing to do that ; the manufacturer should know better how to make this product work
following the instructions , it ruins your cd or dvd even further
don not wast you time , money and your cd / dvd and take it somewhere where they can buff it .
bought these for a long airplane ride
they worked pretty well for a few days but then the right side went out
that seems to be pretty common with this set
also the battery compartment is in the cord and in a really awkward position where it hangs free and pulls on the headphones on one side .
i bought <NUM> prs of these about <NUM> years ago for an extended trip
<NUM> plane rides later , we were all happy with the purchase
i don not think the stewardesses were happy that we didn not have to buy headphones though
but , they worked well and we were able to hear the movie and the movies on our portable dvd players
<NUM> stars because they are a little flimsy and some of them broke with more rugged use when we got home
however , two pair are still functioning quite well
saw these at this reduced price and i just bought <NUM> more pair for some travelling this summer
i don not get into all the techie stuff that others do
i just say if it works well , great .
i got these headphones long time ago and still enjoy them ! they are so good - you just listen to your music and nothing else outside
they have few jacks to fit to different systems , so it can be universal to many audio electronics
also it stratches somewhat , so it can fit to different sizes of head .
i really like these and they do cut out the noise , only one thing i don not care for id the piece that hangs on the cord
it holds batteries in it so the batteries of your player can last longer in energy
nice idea but awkward in use
it is heavy in weight and in a bad spot
this little box should have been higher up towards the head instead of the middle of the cord
however it is a nice headphone and studioquality .
these were great at first purchase , but they did not hold up very well
they were used only inside the home and handled carefully
one side speaker went and then a few months later , the other one stopped as well
they lasted less than one year
don not waste your money
we opted instead for phillips o'neill sho9561/28
these are extremely comfortable around your head , , fab sound .
very nice
i used them as wireless headphones for quite some time before finding myself in a situation where i needed a headset and microphone combination
i remembered that these had that feature - it was not one i could figure out on my own though , i did need to reference the directions as to where to plug everything in at , but maybe that is just me
anyway , once they were all set , they functioned wonderfully !
while these are ok sounding , they have a feature that makes them one i use often
i bought these cheap
they offer pretty decent noise cancelling , for cutting the lawn
also , they come in handy for when i am at workcounting beats and mixing , these headphones with the noise reduction , make it so much better to dial in
as everyday headphones the sound and it is delicate wired nature , may turn some people off
they are somewhat comfortable , battery life is great , and comes with a carrying bad
no quarter inch adapter , not too many people need it anymore
all in all , a bit delicate , wires can become weak at junctions
they do what i want them to do , so i buy a couple and keep a pair as backup for gig
i own grado , too bright , beyerdynamic , my favorite set , and briefly had bose , way too pricey , and nowhere near neutral in sound
if they were more durable , i would rate them higher
if you are careful with them and want cheap noise cancelling headphones , they are worth it .
there is a slight reduction in regular , noise as in air travel , but these are not nearly as effective as bose or .
i had these for only a few weeks and they have quit working entirely
fiddling with the cord doesn not help
for $50 , i expected much better quality
i am sadly disappointed and will not buy any headphone that says "maxell" again - you can not trust anybody these days , they have all gone for cheap and to heck with quality .
i previously had a pair of sony
the big downfall of the maxells are the battery pack
it is about down the cord
if you use them at a desk and move much , you will constantly pull the pack off of the desk and it will fall with a sharp jerk to your headphones
the sonys only used a single aaa battery but the maxells use two
so , sony was able to put it in a compartment on the headphone band with no aggravation
oddly , the sonys seem to have much better battery life for me
the maxells do enclose the ears much better to help block sounds , but they do start to hurt your ears after prolonged use
if you wear them for hours at a time , the similarly priced sonys are easier on the ear
i am not wild about the way the maxells fold up , either
the sonys kind of spin in and make for much flatter storage
another problem with the maxells is a loud creaking sound from the plastic
often just moving your jaw seems to produce a loud noise that comes through quite loud
with a slight , maxell could have a nice set of headphones
wait until then or try another brand .
this is an awesome laptop for its price
only one complaint , as others have mentioned , problems with the power jack
within a month , it got loose and had to keep jiggling it to get it charging
took it back to the store i got it , and they gave me a brand new one one the spot
but , several months later , the new one had the same problem
brought it back again
this time i had to wait <NUM> weeks to get it repaired
two months later , same problem
another <NUM> week repair
i am striving to not move it at all while it is plugged in , but heck , it is a laptop ! anyway , if it happens a fourth time , my warranty says they have to give me a new one .
the sound quality is good , the fit comfy and the cups make for good sound isolation even without the nr on
when you turn on the nr , though , you will hear that annoying jet engine hiss disappear into a faint background hum
i don not even listen to music with these
i put them on , turn them on and then just sleep for the flight
awesome .
these headphones were disappointing
i bought them to use in a computer room that has a refrigerator size disk drive and an even bigger ac unit
these headphones do a good job of reducing the noise but most of the high frequency stuff comes right through
as a result the noise reduction for me was about <NUM> - <PERCENT> of the total
i also tried them with a leaf blower and had the same results
they do seem to work well at taking out low rumbling humming noises like you would find in air travel but not for anything that has high pitched fan noise like ac units or vacuums .
ive had the maxell nc ii over a couple of years & they are still holding up well
i now use these headphones primarily at home to relax in the recliner while listening to music or taking an undisturbed nap
i originally got them because i was a long haul truck driver & the engine & wind noise was just wearing me out not to mention having to turn the radio up too loud just to hear it
these headphones helped to stop that
the noise canceling feature is effective in reducing the ambient noise around me creating a much more relaxed , stress free environment
at the end of the day i wasnt nearly as tired as when i didnt use the headphones
im not an audiophile so i cant give you stats & freq <HASHTAG> but i enjoy my music , books on tape & movies more using these headphones
i also like the collapsible , over the ear design
they are comfortable & i havent had any problems with them getting hot after wearing them over an extended time
the battery life is very good , the electrical cord is a good length & the on/off switch is sturdy with a small green light when on
im going to upgrade to the nc iv for home & keep my nc ii for in the car .
i got these headphones in june
by august the sound in one ear was cutting out
i could move the wire and get it back temporarily
fine , if you don not move your head
now it is october and the sound in that ear is gone for good
that good price for noise cancelling headphones , isn not so great for only <NUM> months
guess they are meant to be disposable
don not waste your money !
i purchased these headphones before traveling to europe for a couple weeks and the headphones worked great
the sound quality of the phones was good quality and the comfort was very nice
the battery powered noise cancellation was also a bonus and it worked very well on the airplane as well as on trains
i used it on both flights with great relaxation and i also used it on the chunnel and some subways with continued satisfaction
the weight , length of cord , and fold up feature all made these headphones ideal for traveling
unfortunately they just are not sturdy or durable
they are made of plastic and feel very fragile
i was always very worried of breaking them in my bag or when putting them in the storage pouch
but worse than their structural durability is that the wiring used is exposed to stress when folded up
in other words the cord is pinched when the phones are folded up and this is a terrible design
after only about a month , one of the wires split and i lost the right headphone completely
and forget about trying to fix it as it is virtually impossible to remove and repair the wire without destroying the casing
i am very disappointed in the lifespan of these headphones and will not be buying from this company again
if not for the poor design these would have been great headphones for the price .
i have never felt a need for noise cancellation headphones , but i received these as a gift
fortunately , no one spent a lot of money on them , because they really seem cheap to me
the construction is flimsy , and they are bulky
maxell might as well have included a paper sack to carry them in , as the bag that comes with them is not much more than that
it offers no protection to the headphones at all
i just can not see packing this kind of bulk in my scarce space
i don not see any payoff for the bulk in terms of the sound that you get : these simply sound quite mediocre with the noise cancellation off
with noise cancellation on , the sound is even worse
it is flat and lifeless
i had recently purchased a pair of sennheiser
they sound vastly better for the money
they fold down into a case and even cost a few bucks less
i don not know about the expensive headphones , but i would rather have a better pair of regular headphones for this price .
i am not an audiophile , but i do care about the sound i hear
i bought this headset last week mainly for the time i spend removing snow in winter
i wanted a headset that covers my ears well , while sounding ok
i thought this noise cancelling phone would be a great choice , especially because my snowblower is terribly loud
well , it does cover my ears comfortably well , but unfortunately thats all that is good about this headset
it isnt particularly great sounding , and the biggest disappointment was noise cancellation - rather the lack of it
it is hard to perceive much difference between nc being on or off ! it does suppress some , so i know it is on , but it can hardly suppress anything real
i quickly gave up any hope about its use with snowblower , but i then found it cant do much about the sound of my home is furnace as well - which is barely audible even without a headset
i have a sony that i have been using for the past <NUM> years or so
it still works great , just that it doesnt have a cupped headset to cover my ear
if that is not one of your criteria , i highly recommend it
it sounds way better , is cheaper ( at least now it is ) , noise cancellation works great too
see my review there .
these cassette tapes work well for my needs
i use them for lectures and not for music
i am happy that they are still available .
i have used maxell cassettes for over <NUM> years and never have been disappointed
if you ar an audio purist , don not purchase this , go for the higher bias
for normal folk like me with ears , this product carries audio to near perfection and at a real bargain price , whether that price is retail or sale .
it is funny to appreciate a source for these tapes , but i do
i may be old fashioned , but i still like using my cassette player and tapes .
i immediately passed this link to friends still using magnetic cassette tapes
they are getting harder to locate and this brand , length and packaging are excellent
arrived on time and in perfect condition
i might add that the box looked like it had a hard shipping experience
no damage to tapes , or their plastic cases .
i ordered micro cassettes and got these , i was angered by the miscommunication and went with another seller , got exactly what i wanted so i am happy
i did not try these out
i don not have a standard cassette recorder .
maxell manufactures excellent <NUM> minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording
as long as you have the right kind of equipment , these tapes record the sounds of record albums , radio shows , , people talking and more
these tapes have <NUM> minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are <NUM> blank minutes for recording on each side
the features of this tape , as one reviewer correctly notes , make it good for recording lectures and music using standard , less expensive home stereo equipment
the tape playback will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your car
if you pay the amazon price of $6
75 for the you spend roughly <NUM> cents per tape and that is very inexpensive
the tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times ; and they take up very little room so they are easy to carry around with you
unfortunately , these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you
this means that if , hypothetically , you were to copy a onto another instead of a maxell cassette tape , the quality of the sound on the copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a maxell cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you
maxell also manufactures higher quality cassette tapes including the maxell ; but it is still not the same as a digitized recording
moreover , cassette tapes can break if not handled with care
they can also break if used a few too many times , too
therefore , i recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup
these shortcomings frustrate me and therefore i will have to take off one star to make this a four star review
the tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible
if you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole
the cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording
overall , maxell makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music , the radio , people talking or anything you wish to record
i have used this brand for decades and i cannot think of any major complaints
i highly recommend maxell normal bias <NUM> minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape .
so i acutally bought these tapes for an art project and i am not going to be "using" these at all
i don not even have a tape player anymore
both projects are lamps made out of either just the cassette tapes or the tapes in their cases
thought i would give both a try and see which i liked better
i really like the first one better , i bought different kinds of lights to try out inside the base
i have also seen people spray paint these neon colors and hang them from string in rooms , put on walls
fun art to remember a cool time when you rewound tapes with pencils so you didn not waste batteries
: p
i needed to buy cassettes elsewhere than where i was buying them from
they were getting more expensive each and every year
luckily i thought about looking here
i found cassettes at a price from a period of many years ago
it literally brought back childhood memories , well not really , but it was very inexpensive
i still like recording on my old cassette player but found many stores not carrying cassettes on their shelves
and when they did , the prices were high
i highly recommend purchasing cassettes here on amazon , they have many different brands to chose from .
all right , i did not time the recording to make sure i actually got <NUM> minutes on each side , but the tape snapped into place securely , and i recorded from one end to the other without it tangling inside the recorder
when i played it back , it played back smoothly with no skips or tangles
i have used three or four of them without a hitch , but then i generally do rely on maxell for my taping needs so i was not surprised
i will buy more again when i need more .
i always order these cassettes online
although people now use cd is , i give a taped session to my clients as a courtesy so i don not have to deal with burning cd is
buying online is less expensive and easier to find
saves me the trouble of locating a store that still carries them
usually one walgreen is that i know of has them but its hit or miss .
recently found a really great onkyo , cassette deck for playing my old cassettes from years ago - for low dollars
this is the best price i have seen on good normal bias tapes - the chrome ( high bias , type ii ) are just too pricey - but these sound just fine for all my music , whether rock , jazz , country or classical
getcha some before the type i prices get stupid , too
and enjoy some george jones singing along with a beethoven tune while david sanborn blows his sax and jimmy page picks his axe .
if you love to record music from cd is or the radio , & dont want to pay an arm & a leg for good quality tapes , these are for you ! i have bought <NUM> '15' count packages of them so far
im very happy
i intend to buy more .
so far , i have been able to use these cassettes over and over again with no problems in the quality of sound produced by them , i really enjoy the blank tapes as i am able to do what i need to get done , no problems .
i just wrote a review on <NUM> maxell tapes ( 3 pack )
this <NUM> pack of <NUM> minute is a good buy of fine quality reliable blank tapes .
two relatives still have multiple vcrs and they tape a lot of stuff
tapes wear out over time so i buy them new tapes once a year or so
these tapes are a very good price and last for a long time even though my mom and aunt tape over them maybe hundreds of times in a year
i have never gotten a "bad" tape or had tapes break .
if you have an old vcr that still works and you enjoy taping your tv shows you now know how hard it is to find tapes
this will more than likely become even harder
we located these on amazon
they are a great buy and are becoming very difficult to find
these maxwell takes are of very good quality and the prices if fantastic .
the package arrived in about <NUM> days and in the advertised condition
i have bought maxell products in the past ( especially cassette audio tapes and vhs tapes ) and have never been disappointed
the color and sound are both exceptional on these tapes
i know that the trend is changing and these tapes are going the way of the ( and i am trying to slowly make the change over to digital media ) but in the meanwhile
i can highly recommend this maxell for your vcr recording needs
vendor appears to be a fine one .
i needed some new vhs tapes and these fit the bill perfectly
they have been working well and i am very pleased with them
amazon has really good prices on everything anyway so i knew i would find a really good deal and i did !
there is not much choice for vhs tapes now , i am happy i can still find them on amazon
i would give this a better rating if one of the tapes hadn not had a broken piece internally , i could hear it rattling and when i took the tape apart there was a piece snapped off
but they were cheap enough that i didn not bother to return the package .
these are really nice tapes , they record well the first time and over and over
still have a vcr to record tv occasionally and these work well
i have used these vhs tapes before and the quality is great each time
i will buy these the next time for making copies
if you still use a vcr , these maxell video tapes are a good quality
i have used them both for everyday recording of television shows and a use for recording a movie i want to keep .
great price and delivery
we cannot often stay up later to watch a favorite show , so we tape it and are able to watch it later
maxell makes a good product that lasts .
i have used maxwell for some time
i liked the price and having used these in the past , you can retape over them many , many times
i use them to tape television shows on air after my bedtime
you get good , clear pictures even after several months of taping
i would reorder these again
also , there are few , if any , places locally to purchase any brand of vhs tapes .
practical and affordable , as usual
that is the &<HASHTAG> ; maxell&<HASHTAG> ; brand
it still gives you quality & integrity with each and every product .
i use these tapes because unfortunately i still live in the 20th century , and still enjoy taping movies
one day , i will order a dvr , but for the time being , these tapes are great !
it is nice to know the possibility is there to find them
with them and vcr players ( next thng i , ll be looking for .
we bought a vcr for nostalgic reasons
we , like everyone else , got rid of our vcr back when we made the transition to dvd , but in the last couple years we longed for a bit of nostalgia , so we bought a vcr , some tapes and these blank tapes to what it was like watching vhs as kids
these are good tapes
they play well .
vhs tapes , got them for my grandma , i am sure they allow her to record the price is right without any trouble .
of course this is a great , great buy
you don not have to pay a lot for quality vhs tapes anymore so we didn not
we got a bargain .
they are hard to find these days
i still prefer my vcr to dvd because i simply do not want to keep <PERCENT> of what i record and vcr is still the best way to go
dvds are too expensive and i do not use cable or satellite or things like that
i get over <NUM> digital channels with my rabbit ears and have very little time to actually watch tv , so i still rely on my good old vcr/dvd recorder to help me eventually view shows i want to see -- when i get the time .
currently i am moving some family memories from older vhs tapes to and ripping them to a digital format on my pc
since these are important memories , i want to have as many backups as possible so rerecording them back onto 'fresh' vhs tapes is something important to me
comparing these tapes to local price , the price here on amazon is very competitive
after recording older footage onto these vhs tapes , i am quite satisfied with the quality of these tapes on the sp record setting
not much has changed in the vhs tape since it has become such a dinosaur , but it is great to be able to get this product when you need it , for a reasonable price .
i still use videotapes for easy , uncomplicated recording of things i don not plan on keeping indefinitely
i have used two tapes from the pack i bought and they are just fine
no problems so far
am rating <NUM> rather than <NUM> only because i haven not been using them long , and i haven not done much , which is something else i do
i may buy more before it becomes impossible to buy them !
the answer is me hahayup i am living in the 80 is
i have three vcr is that and still enjoy watching or buying discount vcr movies or old ones i have filmed
and yes , guilty as charged , i still use them to tape shows i have missed
this is a good value for the <NUM> pack and i tape over them after watching whatever i have taped and so far no issues
i think you can tape over about <NUM> times before the quality starts dropping
this was fantastic , you see my husband and i have a unit that requires vcr tape and we tape our soap operas and this is the only way we can get them
stores just don not have what we are looking for
i admit i still use a vcr , & probably will forever , just seems to work better for me
these are hard to find these days , so glad you can get here & the price is good
it is a quality item as i use these over & over & they never give me problems .
years ago i would be able to buy vhs tapes in just about every store
not they are harder to find , and when you do find them they are expensive
here i was able to buy vhs tapes for under $2
not only did i find my type of vhs tapes , but found other types as well such as pro tapes , etc
i plan on purchasing other types of cassettes in the near future , only because it is affordable and convenient to buy
i also like the fact that they are delivered to your home at no extra cost
i highly recommend buying vhs tapes here , i have purchased over <NUM> tapes so far and all recorded perfectly .
these do the job expected
no problems with recording or playing
it seems vhs tapes are being phased out , at least i can not find them in local stores anymore
these do at least as well as what i have used in the past .
the price was right and the quality is what you'd expect on a vhs
i am using these to record films and would recommend
maxell is a well trusted brand that has quality products
bought these because i still use a video recorder
have never had any problems with them and am sorry to see them go .
a couple of the tapes required break in and i suggest a fast forward and rewind before you start recording
i have dmrs and record tv shows on ep mode
both sound and video are good even on a 60&<HASHTAG> ; plasma and 350w sound system .
very happy with this product
it arrived in record time and the tapes work well with my vcr is
would recommend to otheres that are still using vcr is .
i like to tape a lot on my vcr and this is a quite reliable product
i will continue to purchase these .
these vhs tapes are good but after i got them i realized that i needed more time but this was no fault of the manufacturer and since they are no longer available it does not matter now
i have found them at another website with more hours
now i just have to remember how to use them to my advantage .
excellent of tapes
been buying maxwell for years now and never have had any problem is or been unhappy at all !
had them shipped directly to my brother on the other side of the state
he is a little &<HASHTAG> ; old fashion&<HASHTAG> ; and still records on tape
he tells me that the quality of his recorded material plays back great , especially the football games .
i bought these to use with my vcr little did i know my hdtv will not accept my on air vcr lol so now even though its a great buy
im going to use this some other time i am glad i bought it though .
good tapes that can be recorded many times and are easy to remove from box
if you still use tapes , use these !
use in older security systems , works fine , life expectancy used <NUM> night a week about years , getting hard to find now that everything is digitaledit 3/10/2013some of the tapes refues to rewidn completely , one after only a few days use , some kind of internal binding ? one screeches liek a banshee on rewind but works fine , <NUM> broke
so far <NUM> of <NUM> work ok , <NUM> works poorly , <NUM> fights rewind , 1trashed in can
lower review to a <NUM>
i have found maxell to be one of the reliable vhs tapes
( sony and tdk i have always found good too
) for those who don not know , the <NUM> minute uses thinner tape in order to get it on the same reel as a 120
when tape is thinner there is more possibility for the layers to stick to each other by static electricity
therefore i don not recommend <NUM> for repeated reusing but for some long thing , or somethings adding up to <NUM> hours ( at sp ) to save and watch sometime
the 120s i use and reuse a lot , and keep a lot too
: - ) long may the vcr is survive
oooops ! made an error above
i said <NUM> hrs
at sp
of course , we all know sp is the fastest
lp or slp - whichever your vcr has as slowest is what i meant
fast speed recording is considered best by some
pause at sp gives a jerky picture
at slp you can pause and get a quite steady look at a particular shot , and the overall clarity and quality of the recording i consider quite ok .
these are wonderful for recording anything you like if you still have a vcr ! i will use them and order more !
i bought this pack specifically because each tape is <NUM> hrs long
this length is useful for recording sports programs especially that tend to run pretty long
the quality of the picture is still pretty good even at <NUM> hrs
so far i have had no problems with these tapes
i suggest cleaning the tape deck once in awhile to prevent your recordings from having that annoying picture noise
i got these at a good price ( just under seven bucks ) on amazon
vhs tapes are difficult to find nowadays in a regular store so i am glad i can still purchase these on amazon .
if you still use blank vhs vcs like i do , this three pack is really handy
i know that most of us are using dvds now , but i still find a use at times for an eight or nine hour vc and this fills the bill
this tape stands up pretty well to being used over and over and i would surely suggested it if tape is what you need .
these tapes are oustanding
brillant picture
no tracking problems
i used to buy another name brand <NUM> hour , to many tracking problems
first time buyer for maxell very happy with the product excellent price and quality
believe me i have gone through tapes since vcr ; s first came out still have the original ge vcr
cannot go wrong with the maxell .
i gave these tapes an ok rating because they were ok for recording only one time on them but if you had to on them they were no good and unfortunately i found this out the hard way
i would only recommend these tapes to someone who is only going to use them one time .
great product that performs exactly as needed
great look to it and could not be more pleased
i live in the absolute boondocks , <NUM> miles from the nearest walmart , <NUM> miles from even a mcdonalds burger stand
i absolutely count on amazon
com to order things i need , they are nicely delivered by mail , ups or fedex and spare me the need to travel long expensive miles for some of the simplest things
com rocks !
my maxell <NUM> vhs t160 standard grade - <NUM> pack arrived on time and in good condition
it is very hard to find vhs in retail stores , but i am glad these tapes can be found here at amazon and other websites as well
these can record up to <NUM> hours
i have a vhs tape eraser , which is a giant magnet , so when after viewing my recorded program i erase them to record another program
very durable
can be reused over and over again , best when you erase with the tape eraser , otherwise you will see your old program under your new program
i recommend this product
i rate this a <NUM> star .
my husband was very please with these vhs tapes and he was excited about the price
he would definitely purchase more at a later date .
perfect for people like my daughter who like to record their favorite shows to watch after work at night
with up to <NUM> hours on a tape , you can get quite a few shows on one tape ( of course i don not recommend recording on slow speeds if you want to keep a quality recording
) a perfect solution for those who don not want the expense of tivo or similar devices .
item is for those of us dinosaurs who still use vhs tapes ( i have six working in the house ( as well as many others in various states of [dis]repair ) , plus dvd recorders/players
however , i can not say much about the packaging from amazon
the enclosure was open ( yes , open ! ) at two ends and no paperwork was enclosed
i am hoping someone at amazon reads this and corrects their quality assurance procedures
although the tapes are , i am giving this order a rating because of the packaging .
i use these at work , and the sound is great and the cord frees me from my desk
( i often have to travel around the building
) i work with computers andi wasn not sure how it would work with all of the electrically noisy equipment around us but it works great ! highly recommended !
[december 2000]i really like these headphones
i also tried the sony , which is in a comparable price range
what i liked about sony : longer battery life ( 15 hr instead of <NUM> hr ) ; there is a stand on which you can hang your headphones ; there is an auto feature that saves battery life
what i didn not like about sony : you have to take the batteries out and put them into a recharger unit ( i was expecting to just hang the headphones on the stand and have them recharge , like the palm pilots do in their cradles ) ; when i tilt my head forward ( at my desk , since i use these at work ) , they slide off
what i like about advent : the sound is slightly better ; the battery recharging is easy ( plug it in and it recharges ) ; they are more comfortable than the sonys
what i didn not like about advent : there is no recharging stand ; the tuning knob is in a really bad place ( where you'd put your hands when you are putting the headphones on )
i didn not really care about the range , because i am really only using them in the same room
one thing to be aware of : the advent instruction manual ( which nobody reads ) says you should plug them into the line out and not the speaker out port
the line out has a much stronger signal ( unless you turn up the volume on the sound source )
there is also an adjustment knob you are supposed to use to get the signal strength up to the right level
before i did these two things , i got a lot of noise
after i read the instructions and set up a strong signal , i had almost no noise
overall i really love them
i can listen to music really loud without bothering my officemate , and they are comfortable enough to wear all day without trouble
[december 2003]i no longer use these headphones for day to day use
after about six months , i got too annoyed with the sound fading in and out , the increasing amount of hiss , and the random loss of stereo signal
i am back to using regular wired headphones , this time spending only $18 on an aiwa pair that i like
i still use the advent wireless headphones for occasional tv viewing ( where sound quality is not so important ) , but i wouldn not recommend them .
not the highest fidelity you will ever hear in a headphone , but if you aren not in a recording studio , and are just listening to music while sitting at home or cleaning , or watching the tv and want headphones so as not to disturb the neighbors , these are perfect
they have more than enough range - i can even go well outside , and still hear the music just fine
they are not quite five stars , though , due to not being fully 'fi' , so to speak , and for the annoying need to use another plug cord to recharge the batteries
as far as some other reviewers talking about complications with tuning , maybe i just lucked out , but i had these things tuned in about three seconds
i have also never lost a signal randomly , or had the tuning slowly go out of phase as some others complained
i will say , though , that the tuning knob on the headphones is right next to the volume knob , and it is very easy to accidentally bump the tuning knob when adjusting the headphones , or when one wants to adjust the volume
but this is a minor complaint ( though i would like to see advent begin to put the tuning knob on the side opposite the volume , or in some other less easily accesible spot )
the lows are good , the highs are good , and the ear cushions are very comfy , even for my large head , for extended periods
the cushions i find to hold in heat from my ears and cause sweating ( sorry if that is gross , but you need to know this stuff to be informed )
i have always had that problem with all cushioned headphones since many , many ages ago , and so is not a problem with just these headphones , but the advents cause it sooner than others i have owned - they make a very airtight seal around your ears
for the price , and for the rechargable batteries , these are an excellent deal in my opinion , and i have enjoyed having them and using them , and have just ordered another pair so that my partner and i both can use them to watch movies with explosions and/or loud orchestral soundtracks late at night .
fine sound , good reception over a decent range ( looks like i can get around the yard without them making any big complaints ) , comfortable
i would say that the fidelity is only slightly less than the earbuds i am used to
and the separation is better than i expected
there is a fair amount of hiss if no music is on , but i am pretty picky and i think its totally tolerable .
overall very pleased with the product
the phones are lightweight , comfortable , and the sound quality is good anywhere in our house &amp ; yard
the quality of construction of the phones and the base unit is good
there is an ample supply of cables &amp ; adapters , i
, for plugging into a computer soundcard .
i am not brutal with equipment , but in a few short weeks , the flimsy plastic part that holds the ear pieces to the headset broke on one side
within a month or two the other side went as well forcing me to use office paper clamps to hold the whole thing together
i use them in bed late at night when the household is asleep
a second convenient bedside charger would be nice
i tend to put them down on the bedside table before i doze off rather than get up and walk across the room hook it up for recharge
if you are a late night tv watcher , you too might call this justifiable laziness
too many times i put them on the next night and find the battery is down
i honestly think that before i replace them with another wireless , i'd find a way to sneak an extension wire across the room through attic or basement space and go with a standard wired headphone .
terrific value for the money
sound is very clear and warm
upper range and midrange as good as very expensive corded phones and speaker systems
the bass is not muddy , but it is less pronounced than with good speakers or corded phones
but the overall sound is still excellent
requires a good deal of adjustment and fiddling to get the best sound and longest transmition range out of it
don not set the level on the transmitter too high
you will get speaker overload
you can listen throughout your home , patio , and garage
but you generally get some bursts of static as you walk
none of these drawbacks bothers me
best for listening to cd is
sounds great with lp is too , but it transmits more groove wall noise and static than you are probably used to hearing from the riaa jacks that your turntable is connected to .
these headphones are a decent wirless solution but are a tale of two realities
reality <NUM> - when charged and properly tuned , they sound great ; rich bass and full mid range with good highs
their range is excellent - i have listened to music for hours about <NUM> feet from the base
they are adjustable and accomodate different size heads easily
reality <NUM> - the challenge of keeping them tuned and charged is not always easily accomplished
the battery setup and charging arrangement could have been done significantly better
also unless you want to be adjusting the levels alot you need a fixed level signal
additionally since the frequency reception is quite contingent upon battery strength , if you don not have the time or means to keep the battery charged to certain levels your performance suffers
since i am a bit of a techno geek being mindful of charging and frequency adjustment is not a big deal , but others ( like my wife ) will find it a hassle .
when i dropped them a day after getting them home , the right earpiece shattered , revealing the inside of a very cheap product
. the description doesn not tell you that you have to tune the transmitter , then tune the headset until the signals coincide
that takes a little doing to get it right , and i find that the two parts lose each others' signal several times over the course of a couple of hours
i have to the base and the headset each time they lose each other
it also has an annoying whine most of the time also
since last xmas , it seems like this is the only wireless headphone product in the retail stores , which is a shame because it is so bad .
used it as directed on a polkaudio cd player , and it did not improve the machine
cannot say for sure that the product didn not work , or the machine is just broken
machine started to not recognize certain cds that it played before
using the cleaner did not improve the machines performance .
works very well
used on <NUM> different cd players that were starting to skip , and took care of the problem
easy to follow audio directions .
for quite a long time i believed that the cd player in my truck was broken
then i thought , hey , why not for just a few bucks try this cleaner and maybe it will work
it did ! the cleaner is extremely easy to use
you insert the cleaner disk into your cd player and follow the directions , which are said aloud to you , and in no time the cleaning is done
after it is done cleaning , the disk plays some nice classical music for you , too
i ejected the cleaning disk , inserted one of my cds and voila ! it was working again !
i purchasd a used original xbox really cheap and it wud only play a few games and those that did play wud freeze up
i orderd this lens cleaner and the transformation was instant , plays all my games w no freeze
i also hav a few high end dvd units , one an expensive samsung dvd recorder that stopped recording and playing discs and a toshiba upconversion dvd player that stopped reconizing and playing discs
i popped the lens cleaner in and their both working beautiful now , i was going to throw them out
a great product , and i can use it over and over if i hav any other devices that stop reading and playing discs .
i purchased this from amazon <NUM> years ago and here it is <NUM> years later and it still works perfectly
i had to write a review on such a great product
it is a definite inconvenience when any of your electronic pieces hit the road
your television , cd player , receiver , computer , etc
these are all necessities and if any of them break down they must be replaced immediately regardless of budget
i live in a highrise apartment right in downtown boston and there is much dust
when a cd player starts acting up you don not know what is going on at first
if its dead , its dead
but if cds are skipping or playing errartically what do you do ? is it the player itself ? first you clean the cds
maybe its a simple problem
well , my cd player was having a field day at the time - cds jumping and skipping all over
i purchased this product , used it correctly and voila - the cd player worked perfectly
all the problems cleared up
now , whenever it starts to skip i know it is from dust or something in the player and it just needs a simple clean
bottom line , this product is inexpensive and it works to perfection
i have had it <NUM> years and it is still going strong
i highly recommend this product
finally , something that actually does what it says it does .
i have a modern warfare <NUM> edition xbox 360
it is not that old , but here in west texas , we get a lot of dust
my console pretty much stopped reading discs
i would have to eject a disc , and put it back in at least <NUM> times before it would read it
i ordered this based on the reviews
i figured that it may not read the cleaner disc right away , since it didn not read my games
so i put it in , it would spin up , and then would say no disc
this only happened once ! the next time i ran it , it read the disc ! to be safe , i ran the disc <NUM> times
i put in a game it would not read , and it read it on the first try ! i highly recommend this product .
this product is a wast of money , it is not thing but a cd disc with some soft brushes on it for to spinning around trying to clean the cd player laser eye and this cd disc thing can not clean the laser eye at all
most portable cd player this day are lid open anyway
you properly can clean the laser eye with a cotton swab with a dip of a little rubbing alcohol
that what i used this product for .
my car is <NUM> cd changer was intermittently losing and skipping sound in the left channel
because the right channel remained ok i did not think it might be a dirt or cleaning issue
i figured both left and right channels should be affected
i lamented over my player for weeks because i could whatever the cost might have been to even have a tech check out a fancy bose cd player embedded in the dashboard of a car
i gradually listened to my player less and less because knowing the sound problem just made me more sensitive to the imperfections when they occurred
finally i figured , what have i got to lose just to find out if this is a "dirt" problem ? $8 bucks compared to all other alternatives was a small price to pay
hola macarola
i will be darned if this disc didn not cure my player immediately ! i wish i had given this thing a shot a lot sooner
technically there was problem though
the instructions say the cd has sound
it is supposed to alert you when it is done cleaning or whatever
my product produced no sound at any time
i inserted it into my player and my dash display simply blinked indicating a playing disc
it ran , and ran , and ran
it never alerted me in any way that the process was over nor did it stop running on its own
i simply had to eject it
i deducted one star only because of this "technicality" .
i have the boston acoustics player ( no longer made , sadly )
it is a great cd player and radio , with all of the features i wanted
( it looks and functions like the bose model
but i hate bose with such a passion , i would have paid more to not buy their product
) the ba unit kept returning an error message , "cd ? " after one was inserted
this cleaner , used one time , fixed the problem
problem hasn not occurred again , in more than a year
i was hesitant to try it
some reviews and advice said it could ruin the system
but i was going to not use the system anyway
so i took a chance
turned out to be a good decision , but i don not know enough about why it works to say it would be safe for every unit .
dont waste the money
used multiple times on two different units , did nothing to either
don not bother .
i thought my expensive old sony cd player was finished - it skipped and sound was not as good
allsop restored the player to original good quality
i highly recommend this product .
i can not say with any certainty that it is the end all laser cleaner
it is ingeneous approach does seem clever though
consumers buy this product when their cd player starts skipping
i did too
if you are lucky enough that the problem is a dirty laser , you are in luck
one cannot expect this humble product to fix a mechanical or lubrication problem
good luck , it is definitely worth a try .
this cd cleaner has more brushes to do a little more cleaning to a cd player , but it is not advanced enough for a car cd player .
over the course of the last few months my cd player had gone from the occasional skip to eventually not being able to play a cd at all
<NUM> minutes after my package arrived with this cd cleaner in it and i was playing cds again
i can also play cdrs now , something my stereo hasn not been able to do for six months .
i purchased item for my pc/laptop/boombox/dvd player
just for maintenance to keep eye lens clear of any dirt/dust after using it on all of items their was a coat of dust/dirt on disc
wow what a surprise i try to keep my electronics clean & dust free every months but dust/dirt seem to find it is way inside electronics .
this product really does make a difference
i had an older cd player that was doing a lot of skipping , and sometimes it would not function at all
i ran the cleaning disc through it once , and now it is working just fine
great item to have around even if you only need to use it once a year
certainly beats having to buy a new cd or dvd player !
i have only used it once and it cleared the skipping problem
it has an interesting method to the way it works by playing a piece of classical music while the lens cleaner cleans the lens .
tried this on our <NUM> toyota highlander
the cd player wouldn not even read the disk
tried several times
don not waste your money .
can not say enough good things about this
it took less than a minute to clean my very dirty car cd player
i was shocked that it worked so fast ! just listen to the voice and switch to track 3 , then after the music on the cleaning disk stops , remove the disk and your done
unless they came out with a better product , i don not know why they stopped selling this one !
the cd player in my car went haywire
cd is were skipping and others wouldn not play at all
thought maybe it may need a "clean up
" wow ! put this in the cd player
ran it twice
that is all it took
and to think , i was ready to pay to have a new one installed
have to agree with others
don not buy a new cd player before trying this
besides , the music on the cd isn not so bad either
there is music on the cd cleaner .
my professional cd players have always performed well
they are &<HASHTAG> ; broadcast quality&<HASHTAG> ; units and it is just not acceptable to have them skip or not read a disc
one of my players recently began to do just that and i was hoping to just get the lens cleaned with a cleaner
this particular product did the job and so far the unit reads better and does not skip anymore .
when the cd drive on my toshiba laptop refused to write to cd is i was convinced i was in for a big bill
then i decided to try the allsop cd cleaner
it cured my problem in less than <NUM> minutes
so , if the problems you are experiencing are the result of dirt or dust this is a simple and effective solution
but , don not expect it to cure mechanical or other problems
if your cd drive is giving you problems , this is worth a try
if it doesn not work you are not out much and you know the problem isn not dirt on the lens
my only complaint is that it is not clear when it is through cleaning , so i cleaned the lens <NUM> times before i was convinced it was done .
this cleaner works well for what we intended to use it for , it helps to eliminate dust from our cds .
i was looking for an economical cleaning solution for my dvds so took a chance on these and ordered them from amazon
i don not know what they are made of but they work great
they clean as well as regular dvds without a bit of scuffing or scatching
i followed the instructions and wiped the discs from the centre toward the outside edge
for fingerprints , i found it also helps to breathe on the disc before wiping
the nice thing about these is that they are until they get dirty .
i was expecting to buy a cleaning system that has at least a liquid solution , and of course those fancy ones with a machine that rotates the discs ! but ended up trying this out because of it is cheap price and it is "fastwipe" title , but still a bit skeptical without any wet solution
i am pleasantly surprised that the dry fabric actually removed finger print and dusts rather easily with push of a thumb from center of the disc outward
the discs are cleaned within a matter of <NUM> to <NUM> seconds for a thorough job
i find myself having fun wiping the entire collection of cds , dvds , and discs .
these are good cd cleaning wipes for cleaning fingerprints , stain , and other marks on a cd to avoid going to a dvd store to get it cleaned
good additions for cd protections .
i used this on a disk i was having problems with
after i used this the disk played fine
the instructions told me to wipe on the side with no printing
i was always wiping on top .
i down load a lot of cd is and need to keep them nice and clean
i will use these wisely and keep all my music cd is clean from finger prints and dust
thank you so much
had old movies that we were unable to view because they kept skipping
gave them a good cleaning and all were view able .
i have a netflix subscription and receive dvds in the mail
there are a high number of these discs that have scratches and smudges on them
rather than send it back because it won not play correctly i give them a quick wipe with these cloths and have had success with almost every dvd .
there is really not much you can say about a clean wipe
the product does clean fingerprints on the dvd
i am very satisfied with the product
if it had come with a small bottle of a cleaning solution it would be even better .
these cd or dvd wipes are good for removing surface lint or smudges on disks but dont expect them to remove serious glitches or hang ups
they are dry thats the first hing so they cant really be expected to remove any ingrained glitches but cetainly for the maintenance of disks and keeping them dust free these are very good
i was looking for somthing that would really help to illiminate some hang ups and getting stuck type glitches that i had so in fact i ended up just buying a new dvd of the same recording
but its a good product for maintenance
i guess the lesson i learnt is not to leave the disk in the player when not being used
also the method to wipe off a disk is so important not to use a circular motion say like you would on an old lp recording
so i did in fact also learn something from the instructions as well .
you can use a clean piece of cloth to clean your disk
it did not remove the scratches from my disk
waste of money .
pretty simple product
there are about <NUM> or so sheets in a package
take one out and wipe in a circular motion
gets rid of the smudges and makes the disc shine
however , if your kids touch it with grimy fingers it will struggle to remove those types of stains .
these are indespenisible around our house
out grandchilden find then and play with them
i have witnessed them trying to get our wee dog , nola , to catch as one would catch a frisbee
thankully , we have only totally lost a few cd is
easily replacable !
i use these wipes all the times on my electronics
they are lintless and have many uses besides wiping clean cds and dvds
i use them from time to time to clean vcr heads too
i just cut a small section and saturate it in alcohol
it works a treat
i highly recommend them .
very handy
and reusable
well ,
now i have to provide more words
handy , handy , handy ! i just need to remember to use , especially on rental dvds .
this was the first time i have used such a product and was pleased with the results
works great for a fast clean before playing
i got these to clean dirty dvd and bluerays that i got from netflix
works great
saves a lot of frustration when a movie stops or skips because of crud on the disk .
i purchased this allsop cd and dvd fastwipes , and cannot complain about the product for the cost and how they work , especially when picking up dvds or cd is from the library to watch or listen to that have smudges that can break up the signal , and freeze the visual
they do work but don not expect miracles for nicked or the surface film damaged dvd is that need to be tossed
recommend this product for a fast and time saving cleanup of your dvd or cd , i am definitely going to order another pack before i run out .
i use these to clean every movie i receive from netflix
i repurchase these wipes every couple of months to clean rented movies , wii , and ps3 games
i prefer to see the dirt i am removing
make sure you wipe back and forth , away and towards the center of the disc , instead of wiping in circles , as stated in the directions .
i just needed a product to quickly wipe down my rented movies , or used dvds and cds i purchase online or at garage sales , etc
so far it appears to work well
nice price .
good price but they don not work as good as a mild detergent and warm water
these still leave fingerprints on the disc
good for a quick wipe but not a through cleaning .
in order to read on the package instructions that the cleaning cloths may scratch your discs
but instructions say don not worry it won not affect the playing
i ordered these wipe to clean the discs without risks of scratching them
so i was totally horrified by this information
i currently use a lens cleaning cloth for glasses from my optician
no problem with scratches but more expensive
i returned this product because i was afraid as the package warns that i could scratch my discs
i would not have ordered if anyone had mentioned this information on the website so i could evaluate the risks and make a wise buying decision .
these wipes did get the job done but the fabric doesn not hold up long but for a quick cleaning its good just to have around when u are on the go .
i have looking around for this item for some time
i had some trouble fined them
it work really good .
i have usually used wet cleaners for my discs but have run into quality control problems with the units
i decided to try these , not expecting much
surprise , they work great ! i had purchased some discs with excessive fingerprints and the like , these cleaned the discs right up
as noted in the item description some small scratches or scuffing can be caused by the wipes , not a major problem if care is taken
i will definitely buy again when my supply is gone !
at first i thought it was little bit expensive price , but when i get it and use it , it is not , definately worth the money
this cd & dvd wipes really cleans
the wipes is good quality cleaning materials , cleans the dirts and finger prints off the dvds very well
i definately recommend to give this a try , worth your money , it does the job good
thanks amazon !
i had a dvd that kept on not playing every other disc l got from netflix
it would say the disc was dirty or scratched
i gave any one that didn not play a good clean with these wipes but rearly got any to work
maybe if you had dusty cd is but l never got any sense that this was "cleaning"
more of a light polish
didn not work for me .
did not clean my cds as good as it says
they were still scatched
would not recommend this products to anyone
dvd fastwipes clean my cd is and dvd is and make them extremely clean it wipes of dust and dirt and does a great job !
i just bought my second pack of these wipes
i bought the first pack late last year and am finally running out of them
i was totally surprised that these wipes work so well
i have had dvd is that skipped and could see that there was junk on the surface
taking one of these wipers and wiping the surface from the center to the edge ( across the grooves ) seems to get the job done
today , my grandson managed to put part of his dinner on the bottom of a dvd he handed to me
when i put it in the player it skipped and then stopped
i pulled it out and saw the crud
i used a fresh wiper and voila ! the dvd played without a hitch
i know i am probably not supposed to do this , but sometimes there is a minor bit of stuff on a dvd and i use a wiper and put it back in the package for another use or two
i haven not seen a downside
i truly think they are amazing .
i have small children who often put fingerprints on our kiddie dvds
typically , i clean them by "breathing" on the dirty dvd and using the inside of my to wipe clean these dvds
however , i began to look for another solution that didn not involve my
this product
the allsop cd and dvd looked like a possible solution , so i ordered a pack
after giving them a try , i find they work well
they don not get the worst of the fingerprints off without a little extra help ( or in my case , a "breath" on the dvd ) , but they get about <NUM> percent of the fingerprints off quickly and easily
the material is lint free and works as advertised
<NUM> cd/dvd shaped wipes come per pack
being shaped like a dvd is just a gimmick
i usually fold them in half or quarters before wiping , so if they were ( and thus had a little more material ) it might actually be more helpful than being shaped like a circle
the instructions say that each wipe can be until it becomes visably dirty or worn , so you can clean multiple dvds per wipe
overall , these are a good buy and work well at a reasonable price
four stars .
i have purchased many of these belkin velcro cable ties over the past few years
they are well made and very useful .
i love these things , in fact i use them in my backpack to manage the cables i travel with
power adapters for tablets , phones , chargers and computers , with all that i carry a bunch of cables
so its nice to have these !
if you have cords that you want to identify or cords that you need to pack away then these are excellent
i use them on my laptop power cords , headphone cords , etc .
my stereo system was a jungle of wires once i used these cable times i tamed that jungle
i love that i can remove the cables that i no longer need and add new cables without cutting cable ties .
these work and look exactly as expected
easy to use
what more can i say about velcro strips ? evidently i need to say more to meet the minimum word requirement to post this review .
this are great
they are high quality
nothing more to say really except that they work
i use it for all the cables on my computer .
cable ties works as they are promised to
was able to organize the cables behind the tv , looks much better
preferred to use these over the smaller ties , the larger velcro straps allow multiple larger cables to be bundled together .
they work as i expected they would without too much extra material left over and here are my last words .
quick , reusable , and color coded
these velco cable ties are a fast and effective way to cable management
easy and reusable , unlike zipties .
i definitely prefer the radio shack ties because you can adjust the tie to the size of the tie to the cable , and the whole strip is velcro so no extra cable hangs off of the bundle
but these are a little cheaper and work most of the time too .
good product and different colors come in handy for using a certain color for a specific device , they are priced right so like me i bought <NUM> packs that way i have <NUM> ties of the same color .
these are ok for wrapping cables behind your desk or something like that , but they do not attach to cables
if you are putting them on cables that you wrap and unwrap on a regular basis these are not so good
seemed to be designed for semi permanent installations , not for daily work
for no more than they cost , i would recommend these to everyone
yes the colors are rather primary and boring , but they are dirt cheap and have withstood daily use and abuse
these travel around in my flight case and camera bags all the time and still work great
i am ordering more as soon as i finish typing this review
seriously , stop reading and just buy them already !
as others have noted , there is only a small amount of velcro to hold
also , i like the type of ties that you can wrap first around the cable ( so you don not lose the tie ) and then around the bundle
with the way these work , you can not do that
if you want ties in different colors and you won not be using them much ( e
wrapping up a cable and storing it in a drawer until you need it ) then these might be ok
but for the road warrior trying to keep all his cables organized , pick something else .
these were purchased as an &<HASHTAG> ; add on&<HASHTAG> ; item and must say that they fit the bill in our house
we use them as a tie on the cords for equipment that we move around the house
easy to wrap and unwrap
thanks , amazon !
as someone with far to many computers anything that helps me tame the mess of wires is welcome
this fit the bill well and i like the tab that makes them easy to remove .
these are great
that the hooks of the velcro only occupy a small strip on the band isn not a big deal
they hold well , they are colorful , and good quality
my strips from eight years ago still work .
i use these every day for keeping cords neat since i have a lot of computer equipment , ipad accessories , power cords , etc .
these little cable ties may not be of the highest quality , but they do work , and you sure get a great deal considering the price
there is only velcro on part of the strip , so i don not know how long the tie would last if you were tying and untying it all the time
what i have found , is that if i just tie something up and leave the cable types alone , these work great
i am happy with them .
i travel with cpap machine and this works great for my hose , power cord and extension cord
highly recommended , a+++
i use these all the time to organize my cables and power cords
they are long enough to do a great job ( nlike some that are too short to wrap the entire cable )
i recommend them .
this is cool and all , but i was a little upset when i found out i could buy it at the dollar store for about half the price .
i have been using these for a few years as i use belkin a/v pure cables a lot
the colored ones are nice , think i will use them to color code cables .
a simple little product that is a great help in keeping control cords used on a video jib
i like having them in various colors so as to be able to keep track better of several different cords
these are well made .
i love this things
i use them to keep wires contained and out of the way , and i use them to keep things organized and handy
they can be reused over and over , and the colors help to organize and mark things .
they are simple and easy to use
the eight inch length will wrap around a fairly large bundle
i bought them to use on earbud cables and charger cables for which i trim them to about <NUM> inches in length .
strong velcro grip , long enough to wrap a bunch of cables together , short enough to still be convenient when just wrapping one
good product .
these ties are just what i expected from the photo and description
they are 8" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily
the colors are identical to the product photo , and the quality is high
i use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job
the only improvement i might suggest is make the tag white so i can write notes on it with a sharpie , like pr for printer or st for stereo
other than that they are perfect .
these straps are great for the general purpose of organizing entertainment center cords , computer system cords
my intended use for these straps was to manage cords for medical equipment during travel
the worn straps these were to replace looped onto a cord before wrapping allowing it to stay in place when the cords are released
unfortunately , these are missing that same basic design feature making them more likely to get lost as you need to secure it everytime you release the cord , whereas other velcro straps remain secure at all times
not a big deal if you just want to organize cords of stationary electronics , but then again for that purpose you may as well save a few dollars and buy a bag of classic zip ties .
i hate having long cords gather up in a pile and look ugly
these ties do the job and make it look more organized .
this is a great set of reusable color codes cable ties for medium to large wires
they are a bit to big for smaller wires and you need to get at least a thumb full of wire to secure them properly ( picture sizing out spagetti for two people big )
if you need it for a few small wires it won not work as well
these are also a bit hard to use inside a computer case because of the excess material
i see the appication for these more like using them to bind togther cords from a home entertainment system , or the mess of cords coming from the back of the computer .
performs as expected from any cable tie
i like that it is velcro and reusable unlike the stiff plastic ties
i used it to clean up the wires under my desk in my tiny cubicle at work , so that i am not constantly kicking or stepping on wires .
belkin has never let me down
i had order <NUM> of these packages and used them all - and am ordering more
i am also ordering a longer length version .
it ; s so much easier to wrap a long cord and put a velcro tie to hold the cable in a shorter , bundle than having several feet of all the cords .
they were only a buck as an add on item and work as expected
honestly , it is easier to use a small plastic rubber band if it is a cord you are going to constantly use .
boo , hiss , buy the <NUM> count one in my other review
for some reason these are short and they are not designed to stay on a cable like the other ones i reviewed .
i was looking for velcro ties that had the loop that i could slide the many ipad/iphone cables i carry through
these ties will keep your cables bundled individually but i would prefer an additional loop or eye for the cable than i would wrap the excess around .
i have been using these allot latley and these work great ! don not tear or come apart and the velcro is enough for office use
not recomended for giging musicians or roadies , these are not strong enough for road use but great in the office .
short , sweet , and colorful
everything you could want in velcro ties
=]i am not sure how else to rate these
they are as advertised
for me , it was hard to find short sizes , and they were close enough
the colors are an added bonus
they are , sturdy , and lock together well .
i love the fact that they work well , don not separate and can hold alot of cords at the same tome
my husband hates seeing cables all mess - i always have a spare set for him
all the cables are color coordinated at are place and these are the reason why
this product is very good : high quality , good service , and fast ship
it is sutable with my think before i got it .
these work for just about anything that you might need them for
there are only six in the package so you don not get very many .
if you are looking for something to bundle your cords together or if you have mess behind your tv and/or computer i would suggest these to help you get the cords organized .
these are the typical hook and loop solution
they are mostly loop , and towards the end there is a 1&<HASHTAG> ; piece of loop sewn on
i found this to be rather stiff and didn not readily bend to conform to the cables i was wrapping
8&<HASHTAG> ; is a nice length , but much longer than what i needed , so i ended up wrapping around a few times before trying to close it
you could probably cut an end off , but i like longer ties , as it seems i am constantly moving things around and i get very frustrated when i find something a few inches short
if the 1&<HASHTAG> ; hook part were not as stiff i'd give it the extra star .
fine little velcro ties
the ties lack a tie to the cable ( i use them for extension cords )
if they had a small slot to double them back through it in order to fasten them to the cable then i would rate <NUM> stars .
theres belkin velcro cable ties ( 8 inch ) are excellent
with the color pattern i am able to label both ends of my cables making it a cinch to locate the one i am looking for
all of my cables are bound together with the monster cable management system also sold on amazon
needed some wire wraps ( instead of wire ties ) to keep my bass guitar amp power cord and equipment cord ( s ) in place while not in use
i tried some other brands and was more of a &<HASHTAG> ; pain&<HASHTAG> ; than help
seen this at amazon and it couldn not work better
easy to put on and easy to remove and keeps the cables nicely tied when needed
get price too even if it is an &<HASHTAG> ; item&<HASHTAG> ;
thanks : )
don not spend a lot of money
buy these easy to use velcro cable tie wraps that allow you to use and reuse over and over again comes in multiple color pack ( for that color coding you want to do )
remember these aren not just for cables
i have used them to hold shelves together for extra support ! these really stay stuck together ! i have chained a few together for a bigger project i needed help together
a must have in any household .
i carry these in my tool box and found them handy to use , especaily with the different colors to chose
i have used them to temporarily hold something in place while i am trying to drill it in place
i have even connected severl together for larger items .
these ties are perfect for managing cords
i like that they are reusable and can your electronics
i use the colors based on sound cords
for example : black/silver for hdmi and red/green/blue for composite
i would recommend getting two packages though , you will probably need more than you think .
one inch of the eight is the name tag ( belkin ) , another inch is the hook portion of velcro
if there is any movement in the cable bundle you wrapped , it all comes undone , ( except that 1" of valcro ) what a waste of money
buy something else , i am having to .
pros : - does what it is suppose to do with excellence
- the multiple colors help a lot in organizing which cord go with what or which cord are what
- velcro is effective and sturdy- great pricecons : - only bad thing about this , is i wish it came with more ties , but i don not really think thats a good enough reason not to buy itoverall : excellent choice if you don not want to get the highly expensive cable shields and very reliable
great choice and great buy !
great wire ties
easy to use , release and reuse
the colors make it easy to identify different cords
highly recommend .
i first got these because i needed just over <NUM> cents to get free shipping on an order
in that aspect these little things are great ! there isn not much to say about a cable tie , but for that extra nudge to get free shipping , these are a must ! bump to get free , and multi more crazy wires ! fell off of one , but for under <NUM> bucks , not that big a short for anything other than cables , again not a real con but it would be great to see a similar product with more length
i bought <NUM> packs of these so far and as long as i still have cables , i will slowly get more with each amazon purchase : )
i have used a couple of types of velcro cable ties in the past
the best ones have hooks all along one side and fuzz all along the other with a slot in the top , so you can loop it around the cable at one end so it stays attached even when the cable is unwrapped
these have hooks only on about an inch or two at one end of the tie
you have to wrap it carefully ( and not particularly tightly ) around the cable bunch until you get to then end with the hooks
if you unwrap the cable the tie falls off
these a just considerably more annoying to use than the type i first described
one other review mentioned these work best in more permanent installations where you aren not going to be undoing them regularly
true , but plastic zip ties and twist ties also work for this at a fraction of the cost .
well , they are velco so they work
they do get lost easily though , kind of wish i had bought a different kind .
seriously ? $1
63 for these ? these cable ties are really good quality , have a nice long strap with a tight velcro to secure them all
different colors makes it easier ( kind of ) to keep things organized , but at the very least it adds a bit of color to the jungle of cables you have .
i don not have much to compare these to except for the heavy duty version that i use for power cables and extension cords in the garage
these are obviously light duty
works great for computer and game cables
they are atrong enough to hold my hdmi switch box strapped to the pole of my computer desk to make it easily accessible .
the only thing i wish these had was some means to loop through , so that they could be attached securely to one end of the cable
otherwise i just wrap one end around the cable and staple the two ends together , and now it is &<HASHTAG> ; permanently&<HASHTAG> ; tethered to one end
i guess the only other downside might be that the option to purchase a single colour was not available
what if you want to have only one colour for your cables , so that they don not end up being in your partner is case ? and i suppose the colours could have been brighter
but they do look nice , and there is plenty of length to handle just about any normal length of cable being wrapped up .
it is belkin product so it is of high quality
it does the job it was marketed for
i would recommend purchasing the cable ties .
you can never have enough velcro cable ties
i use them for everything
i also have plenty around
never know when you need one .
i have used these velcro straps , and similar velcro straps from other manufacturers , for several years now to secure cables for computer systems , networking systems , and entertainment systems in my home
before i discovered the velcro cable ties , i was using the plastic cable ties where you feed one end through a hole in the other end , pull until tight , and cut off the "tail"
but the thing i didn not like about the plastic cable ties is they can not be and you have to cut them to remove them
that is not a problem if you rarely mess with your equipment and cables , but in my case i seem to be upgrading something , moving something , repairing something , or throwing something away on a regular basis
that meant i was regularly cutting a bunch of plastic cable ties , getting new ones , and everything , which i sort of began to dread and then loath
the velcro cable ties make it alot easier
there is is a somewhat peculiar skill involved in learning how to wrap these things around a bundle of cables and getting them tight , but once you figure it out , it is very simple and you can get them very tight if you want
i have never had one come lose on its own , so they are also very reliable
basically i'd recommend this type of cable tie to anyone , and this particular product from belkin has worked well for me .
green ones for hard drive , red ones for ,
blue cable tie to help with fans and wires
worth every cent
every pc enthusiast should have some sort of advanced system in place .
these ties are great for something you repeatedly bundle and unbundle like a laptop power cord
they are slightly expensive per strap but are worth it in my opinion .
you can buy the same thing at the dollar store
save yourself the five dollars , but if you want color coding , this will work well for quick visual id .
i will never understand why cable ties are so expensive , or so unavailable
these belkins are really for permanent stereo or computer installation
and even for that purpose , i don not care for their design
if you are a musician looking to tie up microphone , speaker or instrument cables , these are not suitable .
easy to use , i needed them to organize all the cables in my desk , they work but i would rather to get the <NUM> of them in one single color .
these are so much better than using ! n they are easy to see , and - more important - much easier to remove ! how many times have you needed to remove a and you had to find something sharp , then hope you didn not cut through whatever you had bundled together ? ! these are great for the job !
nice for small cable bundling , but not enough velcro for large bundles
works great in computer cases for cable dressing .
same review from me as for the case logic cable ties
these are fine , but because they are only grippy on about an inch at the end , they really only work well on larger cables , like power cords and ethernet cables , etc
i wanted them to wrap up all the little headphone and micro usb cables that i have cluttering my backpack
and these definitely are not good for those size cables
the colors are nice and will help you corral cables at your desk .
easy to use velcro fasteners to keep wiring tidy and neat with a belkin labeled pull take to easy undo the fastener
it works .
i use these to hold my kitchen appliance cords
they work great , i use to use twist ties , which worked , but these are just so much nicer
the entire strip is velcro and then the one end has the sticky part
they come in multi colors .
got these to help tame the mess behind my entertainment center
in essence , they work
they are simply velcro ties you can wrap around several cords , holding them in one , neat bundle
they aren not really meant for identifying cables , but for holding several in a bundle
because they work great , i can not give them less than <NUM> stars
$3 and change is pretty cheap , but if you wanted , you could do the same job with much cheaper products , which is why i didn not give it <NUM> stars
summary : works great
cheap , but cheaper options available .
they are little velcro straps
not much to say here , they work exactly as you'd think they would and do a great job of keeping cables organized .
the product works great but after doing a little more research i found that you can get <NUM> velcro cable ties for about $7
with these , you are basically paying for the little belkin label that is sewn on
just do an amazon search for velcro reusable cable ties
i don not recommend this product unless you absolutely only need <NUM> of them and want a brand name sewn on
they did work great but just not worth it to me compared to other options on amazon .
if you have got any devices that have cables , this is the best system for keeping the cables controlled
whether you are traveling or simply want to gather cables together so they are not hanging or lying all over the place , these &<HASHTAG> ; ties&<HASHTAG> ; do the job .
those are exceptionally well made
i used &<HASHTAG> ; cheapo&<HASHTAG> ; -products before but these are really nice quality and come with a sling on one end that allow you to slide it onto a wire , provided the plug on either side is not too large , so it does not fall off when untied .
the whole tie velcro to it self only at the end of it is there the opposite type of velcro .
i absolutely love these ties and purchased <NUM> sets
i am a guitarist and constantly having to wrap up chords and wires is annoying , especially when i try to take them out again only to find them a tangled mess ! ties are a perfect solution to this problem
i wrap them up and stack them , then when i use them again they are still nicely placed
they look exactly as they do in the picture and function as well as you would think
they are velcro and they hold very well
i have had no problems with them yet
i have been using them heavily ( taking them off and putting them back on again ) for months and haven not noticed much wear at all
sometimes the soft side of velcro frays and becomes useless over time but i have noticed almost none of this with the belkin product
my only complaint would be that they are a little pricey for something that just holds stuff together but you definitely get what you pay for .
this is just a high speed usb cable and is of belkin is normal good quality
it does what it is suppose to do and the price is excellent .
i had a printer i needed to connect to and this was great for doing that and the price was great for what i needed it for .
i had to buy a printer cable for my epson 890
when i priced around , this could not be beat
will not work with parallel port only computers for the person that had a previous review , this is a cable that will only work on a printer that has a usb outlet
this is not for printers that are strictly parallel port hook ups
ends for printer and computer different the usb end that is for the printer if you look in the photo , is the small end to the left
it is only about 3/16&quot ; wide and shorter than that
the usb end for the computer is the big end to the right in the picture ( about 3/8&quot ; wide and shorter than that )
many usb printers have both usb and parallel port connections many usb printers have both a parallel port cable connection as well
that is one of those huge flat type ones ( roughly 2&quot ; wide )
this may sound simple for all you computer experts out there , but with the plentitude of this type of cable or that , it can get very confusing
great buy .
i had no idea what this cable was because i found it in my drawer one day , i thought it was the vcr cable and i tried to hook it up to the tv and vcr one day and nothing happened except the reception on my tv went bland and empty .
i had no idea what this cable was because i found it in my drawer one day , i thought it was the vcr cable and i tried to hook it up to the tv and vcr one day and nothing happened except the reception on my tv went bland and empty .
you did a great job sending this printer cable to me ! i got it really fast too ! thank you !
bought it on sale
cheapest i found , no problems .
i purchased this cable for my wireless printer after it didn not work so wirelessly after all
i leave the cable attached to the printer , and simply plug the usb into my laptop when i needed to print a document
the cable has worked great over the past several months
i did check my local electronic superstore before purchasing a cable via amazon , but i found that comparable cables a ran a high dime
for its quality , you can not beat the price .
i have been using this cable with my samsung laster printer for over <NUM> years now and couldn not be happier with the no problem performance
its long enough to be used as a printer cable ( which is important ) and it works
what more can you ask for from a usb cable ? much nicer setup than the bulky parallel port setup .
this cord does what it says , dont waste your money on "" cords they sell at best buy or other palces
they all do the same thing !
excellent cable
very reliable
now if only my operating system is the same way .
clean connections and flexible cable
no reason topay 2x or more for any other cable that does justthe same .
there is not much to say ! the belkin usb cable works and is priced right on amazon when compared to the "big box" stores
if you have a need for this item , get it
you can not go wrong .
it works great to run a cable from the computer to the photo printer
the cable works great , love how long it is .
what can i say about belikin ? belkin makes great products which makes me satisfied with this cable !
please price this belkin usb pro series 2
0 cable at your local office supply store
i did
it is over $20
another amazing amazon deal
we have three in use
stocking up on a couple of extra at $4
95 each with free shipping is a good idea
quality printer cables will only increase in the future
and the hits just keep on coming .
these are excellent quality usb cables that will allow you to connect any usb device ( printer etc
) to your pc or other usb device .
its always good to have extra usb cables floating around
<NUM> for home <NUM> for work and <NUM> for the laptop/spare .
i decided to purchase this cable after noticing that dell computers offers it online at its online store , which it often bundles together with other data transfer hardware
so i decided that if this cable is sufficiently for dell to offer it at its online store , then it is one i had to consider seriously as a usb cable linking my laptop computer with a brand new laser printer
without question , i made the right decision
i am quite impressed with its excellent data transfer speed , superb workmanship and ease of use
it is an excellent product which i highly recommend to others seeking a well made high speed usb cable .
i bought this cable to use with my new printer
i have had it for about <NUM> months now and it is working fine .
i have always seen products from belkin , and this one is no exception
it is a usb cable at a great price , by a leading computer accessory company
an extra bonus is the lifetime warranty !
there is no reason at all to buy misc
electronic usb cables anywhere except through amazon ! prices at the ishacks'
and the less'es - usually will cost you more than double for the same electronic items found on amazon
so let your motto always be "caveat emptor" i
, buyer beware !
i really like belkin products and this cord works great from my pc to the printer and could not ask for it to do more
hooked it up between my printer and my pc and printed about <NUM> pages with it
works fine
not as quite as cheep as monoprice but the super saver shipping will make up for that if you are ordering more stuff .
does the job intended , good value , good quality
not a bad product for the price
there are better products out there , but not at this price point .
it might be a little short but seems to be a fine cord ( don not know what else to say )
my 'amazon verified purchase' badge for this cable dates all the way back to september 23 , <NUM> according to my instant order update
ironically the cable is in the other room connected to a printer and still transmitting flawlessly
the moral is this is one well constructed cable and has returned my investment many times over
the connectors still mate and disengage smoothly like the first day i used it , and i am pretty sure that the beefy strain reliefs on each end are responsible for keeping the conductors inside the thick insulator intact
indeed , as i inspected this cable before writing this review i marveled at the construction and materials
both are first rate
this cable has traveled extensively - it was part of my travel kit when i was a road warrior consultant , and served me well in many us states as well as the middle east on long and short assignments
back to the strain reliefs : i would hastily pack and literally ball this cable up and throw it in my laptop case , yet the ends never damaged , which i attribute - in part - to the strain reliefs that kept crimps from breaking or fraying the conductors
bottom line - this model is now usb 2
0 compatible and is built to last
in other words , you cannot go wrong .
this is a good usb cable
it is compatible with both usb 1
0 and 2
0 ports
it is long enough to give great flexibility with arraging whatever it needs to be connected to
the price is extremely good ( even though amazon
com changes it every now and then ) for this cable
it is way more expensive in stores
and getting a belkin product for such a low price is excellent
this is totally worth the money , and is a great buy if you need a usb cable .
i was looking for a usb2 cable to hook up my printer , i found this and i don not regret it , the build quality is excellent , i recommend it .
considering all the products on themarket , this cable does the job perfectly and theprice is great
thanks amazon .
this is a reliable brand and does exactly what it is supposed to do
great product for the price
i only needed one , but was tempted to purchase more just because it was a great value
i would buy again .
package was recieved barely <NUM> days after i orderd it i am extremely happy would that all packages arrived aspromptly as this one
okay , since most of the printers don not come with cables any longer , you always need to purchase one separately
a &quot ; regular&quot ; printer cable can cost around $20 and it can be difficult to plug and unplug correctly without breaking one or more of those tiny prongs
so a usb cable is a great solution
it costs less and it is easy to plug and unplug , especially if your computer has usb ports
i bought this one for my new hp laserjet <NUM> printer and it works just fine
for this price , it is a great bargain .
i purchase a new printer from a very well known computer store
i wonder who that might be
hehe ! but getting back to the review
as most of you know , a lot of usb devices don not come with a usb cable
the same thing applied when i purchased my new printer
the clerk who sold me the printer suggested i purchase a usb cable along with my printer
the asking price : $29
95 for a <NUM> foot long cable
i told him &quot ; no&quot ;
then purchased this cable on amazon for $10
95 which included shipping
the only thing that got to me about this deal was that the shipping cost more than i paid for the usb cable
oh well ! i bought some sushi with the <NUM> bucks that i saved !
basically needed a longer cord for my usb hub
the stock cable that came with it was so short
didn not want to spend a ton of $$ but still needed something with good connectors and decent speed
this did the job without breaking the bank
would recommend !
extremely low price at a high quality made
the cost of it is only a small fraction of any cables price at stores .
i am not sure how this can be advertised as a belkin product
the cord that was sent to me is clear with two bright blue leds on the ends
it works , just bring some sunglasses .
when i bought a new printer for the computer i use , i needed a usb cable to connect the printer to the hard drive
i ended up purchasing this usb cable from belkin
it works great and i have never had any problems with it
even though the cable is a 2
0 device , it is apparently backwards compatible and will work with most 1
0 devices , too .
absolute dependability , no matter the device they connect .
ran a local networked computer on this wire and had no issues whatsoever
good quality and no speed issues whatsoever
update : still using the wire for networking with zero issues .
the item arrived in a timely matter and works great !
not much to say since it is just a usb cable
i ordered it , it arrived , and it works
i plugged one end into my computer and the other end into my printer and lo & behold i can now print things from my computer , just as you might expect
it does what it is supposed to do with no problems , so five stars
too bad everything can not be that simple .
this cable is very good i recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend it
this makes it much easier to plug and unplug usb devices
also allows me to play on my device while it remains plugged in
i measured it to be sure and it is <NUM> feet and an inch - so they did not short me on the length at all
i recommend this quality product .
it works
i use it to plug portable hard drives into
the through put seems pretty good
it works fine .
a good quality cable at a reasonable price
works as advertised .
this cable works well and is a good quality product , unlike other cheap cables which sometimes affect the usb transport
i recommend it .
great does whats described sorry cant think of anything else to say except i hate that we have to do this in twenty or more words totally excessive
it is an extension
kind of hard to say more than that
it is a belkin cable , so it is good quality
the ends have molded strain reliefs
this is a usb 1
1 cable , however , so data transfer speeds will be slower
but if you are using it only to charge something , it won not affect it .
instead of the pictured belkin cable , i got a flimsy generic cable
total and complete rip off .
this simple usb extension cable seems to be very well made
it has heavy molded connectors and a flexible insulation on the cable
extended my tablet charging cable and works just as it is supposed to do .
great usb cable , durable made very well
i use this cable to add a extra usb port on my desk so i don not have to bend over and plug in flash sticks or other usb devices .
i use a mac , and everyone knows mac lovers keep their keyboards
the one thing is that if you use a mac keyboard , they have the shortest cord ever
so i got this and it worked like a charm , giving me that extra distance between my mac and my keyboard on my desk ; keeping the wires off the top of my desk .
i needed an extension for my wired mouse and this extension was the answer , works great , plug in and go !
with the popularity of flash drives and the inconvient usb connections on most computers ( in the back or in the front that requires lying on the floor to make the proper connection ) , a usb extension makes a lot of sense
this one fills the need splendidly .
this is a staple that you must have on hand
it has so many uses
it is a good product .
good cable , no drawbacks , works fine , clamps on firmly , not much to add here
this is the best deal you are going to find for these extention cables , great quality .
this is a great accessory to use with a webcam on a laptop computer
my webcam would not attach and sit securely atop my laptop screen that i use
because of this i had to position it on a nearby flat surface , but the cord was too short for my needs
with this extension cable i an place cam on suitable site and use the laptop without worrying about the cam falling off , or having to constantly be repositioned
the cable can also be utilized with other peripheral devices that hook into usb connectors
very useful device !
it is a cable , what does one say about a product like this
i wanted one and i now have it
a <NUM> meter usb extension cable for this price from a reputed maker is a surprise
works well .
ii needed this to expand the reach from my laptop that i have connected to the flat screen to the marble mouse and worked fine
price was good and product is belkin
the cord worked great
i needed a longer cable for my logitec mouse
the cord fit on there prefectly .
i had a <NUM> pc that i needed to run
it booted up and ran the display
unfortunately i did not have a <NUM> keyboard
this adapter filled my need .
perfect if you have an older type keyboard plug and need to use a type keyboard with it .
item that arrived was opposite gender from what is pictured , both ends
in addition , one of the pins was badly bent--something easily fixable , but not in condition to sell .
use with an opposed adapter to monitor a server with an old rack mount terminal
worked as expected
<NUM> star because you can fined these .
it does what it was supposed to do
it works well for the computer it was bought for
thank you .
great if you need to work on an old school computer tower and don not have an adapter plug for your minidin6 plug
as most of the old school users will remember , these adapters came with every keyboard and computer system until the motherboard manufacturers finally switched over the standard input type
it was a welcome change too ! these plugs are very handy to have especially if you do any computer work such as repairs , mods or upgrades
it is a tool you will suffer without if you don not keep it in your toolbox .
the package arrived in a timely fashion and in good shape
the adapter is exactly what i wanted and makes the connection i needed .
if you want to use your newly purchased <NUM> ibm model m keyboard with a modern computer using a ps/2 interface
: p
perfect , worked exactly as expected
needed this to attach my model m keyboard to a kvm switch
so happy , typing on it now !
affordable and works for us keyboard nerds who love the old style keyboards
i even use this attached to about <NUM> more adapters and i have no keystroke loss or anything .
my favorite uncle , now in his 90s , hangs on to an old <NUM> pc running dos even after i bought him a new pc
he uses both
but he has also hung on to old keyboards he loves , including a pair of keyboards so old that they have the old pc/at style keyboard connector
he wanted to use one of them with his new pc that has usb inputs only ( i had previously bought him a ps/2 keyboard to usb adapter so he could use his *other* beloved , only slightly newer , keyboard
) he called me asking if i could find a way to get his old "big round plug" keyboard with the new pc
this belkin f2n017 adapter was just what he needed ( combined with the aforementioned ps/ adapter )
i had it sent to him and he called me a few days later , with delight , saying that the adapter worked perfectly , adding that he was astonished anyone still made components for devices as old as he was using .
it is a good cord
simply packaged
nicely priced
there is not much more to say about a simple cord .
not really much to tell
i needed a replacement power cord for a computer ( puppies chewed the old one ) , bought this one from amazon
com , plugged it in , the computer works
as jerry pournelle has said before about belkin products , it just works
and the price is right .
i needed a replacement cord for my computer and this one works great ! very easy to hook up and at a great price !
not really much to say other than it being exactly as expected
lost the cord to my tv ( moved it around a lot ) and this fit perfectly
cord doesn not get hot at the connections and fits sturdy into the plugs on each end .
cables either work or they don not
belkin works great ; it is now my brand of choice , and i don not look at any other cable other than an amazon brand cable .
this extension cord is a waste of money and i feel like a tool for ordering it
i should have ordered a cheap one instead
i guess i bought the brand name instead lol fml
i just built a new pc when it dawned on me that i didn not have a power cable
i borrowed my printers and bought this one right away
cheap and it works
what more could you want ?
a friend of mine gave me an old computer of hers , but the computer lacked a power cord
low and behold , belkin comes to the rescue
the power cord was perfect for the old pc , but would be good for a new one as well
it never hurts to have extras on hand when it comes of cords and cable for any computer
great product from a reliable company .
for such a low price it is great ! it is true to belkin price high quality product ; can not be beat
somehow in my piles of cables and connectors i managed to lose one of these
i bought this as a replacement for my thecus n4100pro server but also tried it on my ps3 and samsung 26" lcd tv
it worked fine on all of them .
this power cord fit the monitor and the outlet
what more could i ask for ? worth the $ if you need one of these .
if its wire , i perfer belkin
in my opinion its a quality cord
this cord is being used on a monitor and i like the way it lays
it doesn not have a mind of its own
it stays where you put it .
works great ! i plugged it in to my acer monitor and image is as it should be
no cut outs and good quality .
i needed another power cord because i forgot to bring it with me on a trip , so i ordered one from amazon and got it in two days ( amazon prime )
this belkin cord has a higher quality than the one that originally came with my pc , and the price is very reasonable
i recommend it highly .
purchased these for the two hp monitors we picked up at the local goodwill
cheaper on amazon than buying at the electronics store and works just fine .
>seriously , this is a great product to have around when something "gives out" or stops working ! or to leave plugged in at difficult to reach receptacles where you might use some type of pluggable device ( burner , printer , or even a small desk top cpu or a monitor that you occasionally move around ! )
belkin quality here , even at this price ! my power cord came from "techused" company ( though that name is a misnomer because the cord was brand new , in original packaging ! ) --shipping included
it arrived quickly , ahead of schedule , nicely wrapped , [other companies compete on this item , literally different by a penny--i thought that "techused" did well for me , and some other companies might not do as well with this or other items
just saying ; from experience
]>this cord did not warm up or soften at the ends when used with even "old" ( crt ) monitors and computers ( addressing concerns seen concerning other similar power cords )
[if you need a longer , cord , then look at the belkin cord ( "belkin ac male to female replacement power cord" , by belkin , sold by amazon ) --that longer one being available here at amazon for a little more than twice this one is price
] since you never know when you might need that extra length--buy both .
high quality material and brand
you can buy this product to replace any cable if you broke the original or if you want to use a diferent male to avoid using an adapter .
this item did not work for both an led monitor or for my desktop pc
for the price , i am just going to throw it away
although the plug has the right shape , it fits loosly in the socket of the device .
good quality , its sort of hard to write allot about a cable but i would buy this one again
thanks jp
we needed a replacement power cord for a lcd tv
did a bit of looking around , all of the ones we found were $10 and up , for a power cord ! not only did i find this belkin power cord on amazon for much less , it is a name branded , ul listed , and just a higher quality cord
after getting it out of it is package it didn not retain it is bent/wadded up form either ! pros : cheap ! ul listed ( far too many companies are using cheaper certifications )
has a good memory , i
doesn not stay coiled up from being packaged
cons : doesn not magically lower my electric bill
lol : )
works just like any power cord should , no issues at all , bought as a replacement for one that was ran over with a sweeper .
does what it says , says what it does
you'd have to work to screw up a power cord imo though .
i needed this cord to supply a desktop with ac voltage
it works perfectly
i have no complaints with it .
works like it should , and cheap as well
worth it in my opinion , and i definitely recommend it if you need a power cord .
i don not know what else to say about this product , but it is exactly what i expected and works for me
i am glad i could find one at this price
any electronic store would sell this for $18
good snug fit on both ends
no overheating of cord with my computer hard drive and screen
works perfectly
good sized cord , which is average for <NUM> foot cord length
( had lost my <NUM> previous cords )
belkin makes a good product .
this is the power cable i needed to use with my desktop pc and it worked wonderfully
the fit on both ends was snug and secure
i didn not experience any loose connections that others have mentioned at all
it plugged into my power supply with just the right amount of force and it will never detach itself unintentionally
pc powered up immediately on first try - which really doesn not need to be said
the bonus - it is really cheap !
looks nice , considering it is a cable
it works well too
my only issue is that i find it a bit short , it is the correct size but for my preferences <NUM> feet isn not that big for cables in general
regardless , did it is job well
i am satisfied with it
bought <NUM>
had enough to make it possible to get this cord
very happy with it ; belkin makes a good line of products , at least so far as i have found .
well known make to me always rated
used a few times and no issues yet
hopefully will last a number of years .
this is what i used to replace my monitor power cable that i also lost
this way i was able to turn on my monitor .
belkin is a good brand , so i did not hesitate in purchasing this power cord
anyway , there is not much science in a power cord
this one fit perfectly .
this is one of those products that either works or it does
in my case it worked
i used it to power a crt monitor .
product came in belkin packaging and was the same quality as power cords that come with computers and printers
worked perfectly with my lcd tv .
it works , it is long , it is tough , it is high quality material , my chiwawa is not going to be chewing through this
if your looking for a power cord that just does its job , then get this one
you can not find a better ac adapter power cord .
this is a basic pc cable it works on most computers and monitors and some printers
this is way cheaper here than in walmart or another store so if you can wait for it in the mail do it will save you some extra $$$
i needed a power cord for a cisco switch i bought recently
this cord was cheap and got the job done
i will be buying another one if i ever need it
i used to have a ton of these lying around and got rid of them
isn not that the way it always is ? : )
this thing is more then up to the task
this is as good as the cord that come with any computer , printer , or tv
it is a great replacement part for a good price .
when , after moving a treadmill , i couldn not find the power cord , my first efforts were devoted to locating the manufacturer is website , phone number , mailing address , all the while wringing my hands in despair that my costly , indispensable machine had been rendered worthless due to the loss of a mere power cord , which certainly had to be to fit the opening designed for it by the makers of this aristocratic device ( 30 years ago i viewed all owners of treadmills as elitists )
but while waiting for a company representative to answer one of my phone calls , it suddenly occurred to me that my father had once purchased a power cord for an old tv set at a hardware store , and with no regard even toward the make of tv
so i looked on amazon , instantly found something that looked promising ( the description "universal" was admittedly encouraging ) , and in two days both the treadmill and i were back up and running
the pedestrian exchange ( in both senses of the word ) would no doubt have proven satisfying to anyone of any age , generation , class , ethnicity or gender , amounting to no less than the discovery of one is autonomy in a world of experts and "gotcha" specialists
moreover , how reassuring it is whenever one discovers and comes into possession of the knowledge that previously had no doubt belonged to everyone but your own isolated , " , " lonely self
i hesitate to say whether the cord was more empowering to me or the treadmill
but don not be shocked if the product delivers what it promises--twice over
[since writing the above , i have discovered a company ( essential sounds products , inc
) claiming its power cord is "amazing , " "innovative , " "revolutionary"--that after using it to supply power to , for example , an amplifier , the cord is owner will settle for nothing less ( "one listen , and nothing else will do" )
this possibility sort of blows my tribute to the universality of the common power cord , but i remain to be sold on the new , revolutionary product
if it converts my television set to "" ( for those of you old enough to remember ) or my kitchen toaster to a forge suitable for alchemy experiments , i will be persuaded
return for updates
the esp ( the acronym for the manufacturer ) power cord begins at well over a hundred and the power strip at five hundred
i smell exploitation of musicians ( and gearheads ) who , like athletes , are sometimes willing to try anything for that winning edge
better to buy this belkin and , if it bothers you , paint it some other color and put an exorbitant price tag on it so people will think it is one of those elitist a
i recently acquired an old desktop from a friend that didn not come with a power cord
this arrived quickly and works well ( at least for the week or so that i have been using it )
i don not foresee any problems .
ive got a rabbit and she decided to
worst part is it sat there for a while and i didnt know it
one weekend i decided to pratcticeeat my power cord for my amplifier was chewed up
what did i do ? i hopped on amazon and bingo i found a new one that was a good deal ( 6bucks with shipping ) and i ordered a new one
two days later i was back in business
all i can say is &<HASHTAG> ; that is what i
m talkin about
nothing special here , we needed a few spare power cables for some pc is and monitors that went missing and these fit the bill perfectly
no issues , cheap , and work great for various 23&<HASHTAG> ; lcd is and xps <NUM> dell systems .
exactly what i needed to get my lcd monitor working again
for buyers , this is interchangeable with many desktop computers and other monitors , so buy it with confidence .
we bought a couple of these to replace our cords to our monitors because we had european cords
anyways , these are just as good quality as the originals and dirt cheap here on amazon , so it was a no brainer
perfect .
bought it to use as an extender but it wasnt for that and even so i kept it because it will be used for something
this cord is amazing
it feels great and fits into most monitors
it is also made by belkin which means a lifetime warranty and quality product
and its cheap !
extension cord was needed to make my computer monitor stretch farther to my desktop unit
fast shipping and works great
no problems after <NUM> months .
these work great when chaining lighting and speakers
i found these in red , blue , and yellow on amazon , they are different colors and legnths
i wish they made in colors
that would be great
having the color allows you to know how long you are grabbing !
simple need and this product delivered
great quality too and very heavy duty
connections are solid with no worry of accidental disconnect .
when i rearranged my office i discovered the power cord from my computer monitor would no long reach my battery backup
an extension cord was needed
i have used belkin products before and have always been satisfied so i didn not hesitate to order this online
i received it in only a few days and it worked perfectly
the plug ends fit snuggly and the picture on the monitor is as good as it was before i added the extension cord
and at a great price , too .
some belkin branded products are overpriced imho but this cable in particular is a steal
hard to find in stores and if you do find it expect to pay times the price .
choose this product from a reputable mfg
to try and extend my computer reach before making a permanent installation in my home .
it is an ethernet cable
it is fifty feet long
it works
need more ? well , i like that the plastic molding at the connectors doesn not slide down the cable
still need more ? buy it if you need it .
it is an ethernet cable
what is there to be said ? it is cheap , and it works fine .
it fits
it works
it was priced right
i bought it
what more can i say about it ? still need <NUM> more words
sheesh .
great value if you just need a regular <NUM> ft
ethernet cable , and you don not care about the color , etc .
i saw the same exact cable at off ( oh i mean bestbuy ) and it was <NUM> bucks more
buy here , be confident , the wire is just as quality than the one you will get at best buy
im am extremely happy with this deal
i paid <NUM> bucks for a 40+ cable , doesnt get better than that .
this is a great buy if you need to run the wire from one room to another
the brand is good and the quality is there .
i ordered this cable from sewell direct
i received the cable in generic form
it was not packaged by belkin
it did not say belkin on the cable itself
it came in a plain plastic bag
my cable at home has belkin imprinted on it , enclosed in belkin packaging
i returned it to sewell
they promptly refunded my full purchase total plus the return shipping costs
they should specify this generic or bulk packaging , so that i do not waste my time ordering from them .
cable was delivered promptly , product was as described
used it to connect a second computer to a router
connections worked with no problems
connector ends appear to be sturdy enough that i have no concerns about connecting and disconnecting this cable over time
considering the price , this is a good value .
i bought this exact same cable in the <NUM> foot length a couple years ago and was very pleased with it , and needed a longer length for my new setup
so i went to look for a <NUM> foot length of the same brand , same model ( as it were )
found it ( this one )
ordered it
received it
opened it
and then it hit me
the stench ! the cable i got reeked of chemical , plasticy , rubbery odor that was highly unpleasant
this wasn not the case with my <NUM> foot cable ! perhaps they cheaped out on the jacket ? or just simply changed suppliers ? i have no idea
but , if you have a sense of smell at all , avoid this cable
i ended up buying a dynex 50' cat 5e ethernet cable from best buy for too much money
what can i say , i needed it right then
something very similar is sold on amazon for a lot less , but it doesn not look exactly the same ( although it probably is )
if it is the same , then i can tell you that the dynex cable does not smell at all and is a very nice and flexible cable which feels like it has some kind of high quality jacket material
buyer beware .
what can i say ? it was a great price on a <NUM> ft network cable and it works great ! will buy again if needed .
the cable is of good quality and had worked without problem
the terminations are easy to plug in and remove
there have been no performance issues with this cable .
i received this item in record time i dont know how these guys do the item for such a low price
why buy unknown makes names when you can get the real thing for less
thank you and i will surely buy again and reccomend
wish you every success
i have the tools needed to make my own ethernet patch cables , but for $12 , i opted to just buy this 50' cable and be done with it
the cable is high quality and the connectors are strong and molded in
so for less than <NUM> cents a foot , i have just what i needed .
after receiving this cable i immediately plugged it into my router and my <NUM> and was up and running
just what we neede for xbox live
seems to be a high quality cable .
it is a cable , what does one say about a product like this
i wanted one and i now have it .
i have an old pc in the basement that runs as a file server ; instead of buying a wireless card , i picked up this cable and ran it from my router up into the rafters and down into the front half of the basement - with cable to spare
it does just what it claims to do - gives you <NUM> feet of cat 5e cabling glory
: )
this cable performed perfectly
the data transmission speeds were every bit as fast as i had hoped , and the cable was not bothered by being in direct sunlight .
its a 50' ethernet cable that i got for so low a price it bugged me for a bit
i got over it
this cable is well made and works as described
now the seller , on the hand , was incredible ! i got the item in three days brand new .
there is nothing to it
the belkin network cable worked well right out the box
its solid construction produces good signal conduction
so far i have used it to download firmware to my bd player
great product
worth every penny .
the cable connected my computer with the blue ray dvd player to give me access to netflix
it worked flawlessly .
don not go to best buy and pay that <PERCENT>
these cables are just as good , if not better
you won not be disappointed by the quality , and the length available here for a fraction of the retail price makes them a bargain
frankly , the big box stores should be ashamed that they mark up items like this so much
the real quality and bargains are found online , with items like this one .
i needed to connect a blu ray play to a wireless across the room
50ft belkin cable worked out great for this task and now i get all my bd live stuff .
i set this up and have been using it for a while now
excellent quality and was able to run it throught the floor boards to my ps3 for a faster network connection .
a regular long ethernet cord that shows no signs of wear
however , it does not catch in ethernet slots ( it sometimes slips out ) .
belkin rj45 cat 5e snagless molded patch cable worked great for my computer , without any problems
we have a wireless internet/connection in the house now , but i keep belkin 5e snagless molded patch cable .
what can one say about an ethernet cable ? this is well made and works properly when plugged in
reasonable value and i will order belkin cables again
rarely do you find such a good deal on such a typically overpriced commodity
why should a simple cable that is used by billions of people be so unreasonably expense usually ? well , the answer is because they can get away from it
in this case i felt like i paid what i should pay
good price and the product was everything i needed
shippiing was pretty darned fast too
this belkin quality cat5 is well worth the super almost rediculous low price
if your wired and need length , this is the product for you
eat crow radio shack !
not much to say- works as needed ; cheap
will buy again if need
recommend .
i just needed it to work ( connecting ps3 and router ) , and it does , <NUM> stars .
this is the 2nd time i have used belkin cat5 is , i have some shorter ones and needed to change my router placement
i have also used belkin hdmi cables and i think fiber optic cable as well
i have never had any problem with their cables so far and their prices are reasonable .
i like the snagless feature and easy coiling for storage of this cable
i get it out when using my portable in a wired network and then coil it up and stow it in the case .
usually it is better than average , but this one is not as good as i bought before
i have quiet few belkin is items and i like /trust this brand
everything would be fine if not for the cheap plastic plugs
if ur intend to unplug/ it often , than i recommend other screwed up on this one ; ) thought it is not like it in the garbage
; ) ) )
the pink cable was like $1 when i bought it , so you really can not beat the price
its a pretty standard cable and it works just fine
the connectors are pretty good , the only negative i have is the little plastic guards that protect the tab on the connector are fragile ; if you push them sideways very much they come right off
but honestly you don not need those ( they can even be annoying in tight spaces ) , and for $1 the quality can not be beat !
some days it is better to just buy a good cable like this instead of putting your own ends on a bulk cable
very reasonably priced and a quality product .
this was exactly what i needed
thanks for great product and great price
the product is sturdy and works well .
i ordered this as a spare so i have not used it yet
it does appear to be of good quality .
it works as i expect an item from belkin to work
i needed a few extra cables to connect some home theater components to the switch box for the router , these do the job quite well .
shipped immediately to me , this patch cable is worth way more than i paid
very good quality
excellent customer service as well
excellent value and product
these cables rock , i got a bunch for my dorm room , and they work perfectly and do what i need them to do .
i am pleased at how well this cable works
i use it to hook up my xbox to my router in order to get greater speeds for streaming video and it doesn not disappoint .
i have no complaints pertaining to this cable
i particularly like the molded connector feature
it is always a personal fear of mine that my wires and cables will fail at the connector due to cheap construction
i doubt that will be the case with this cable from belkin
i also give kudos to the pricing
i simply cannot argue with $3 for a <NUM> foot cat5 .
secure snug fit great colors price is definetly right ! get what you order at your door with minimal time usually <NUM> days
i bought this cable and it worked well
i would recommend it to anyone who is looking for products sold by belkins .
great quality cable
what i mean to say is it is well made and has decent insulation tonot disturb the flow of information between that and your modem
2nd finally able to color match some of your cables so they actually add to the look of your rig or ambiancei would reccomendthese cables
works very well ! it has a nice length to it
for it to have been so cheap , it really gets the job done
it doesn not fall in and out of the ethernet slot
it stays right in place .
don not care about color the cords are hidden
just like the high priced store cables
great packaging
why go to bb when you can get these .
these belkin network cables are , and they do the job
of all the colors available , the gray is the least expensive , and blends in well .
i got this cord for under $5 and it lasted almost a year before the plastic ends broke
i unplugged and replugged it in one or more time a day and was satisfied with it for how much abuse i put it through .
what can i say- it is a cat 5e cable and it works exactly as described- no problems
for people who can not deal with making our own cables- like me .
this item worked as expected and the price was lower than other suppliers
i have had no problems with this item thus far .
it is not the prettiest cable in the world , but it is and it does what it is supposed to do
i can not really ask for more .
its a patch cable
i hooked my xbox and dvd player to my router and can now access the internet on both .
these belkin category 5e cables are well made
they are a good overall gauge thickness and the snag less ends are very beneficial
you may have experienced the problem of untangling a phone cord , only to have the clip on the end bend over or worse yet snap off
the next time you use that cord it doesn not have anything to keep it in the wall
well what belkin did with these snag less cables was put twin ridges made out of a rubbery plastic , that puts the snap in clip in a valley down below the ridges
so if you are untangling , those ridges prevent other wires from snagging the clip
that is a great idea
that is not enough to make you want to buy the cable , if it weren not for the fact that it is overall a great cable
the length is good for a small patch area , like when connecting your modem to a router , or when your cable or dsl modem and/or router are right next to your computer
the other nice thing is the price here at amazon on these cables
i went into the local nationally famous office supply , and they were half again as much money
so overall it is a very nice combination
they also don not slow down your connection at all
i get the same exact connection speed when using the online speed tests when i use the , or the
highly recommended
buy it here at amazon and save the money .
i am using the cable to connect a router to a desktop
it works fine
good quality cable
i used it to hook my hdtv to my router and have had no issues
would buy again .
the is an extremely cheap and one of the fastest commercial cables you can get
totally worth the money
look no where else .
this was just the right length , color , and price for us , came in retail packaging and works fine for us
the quality of this cable from belkin seems to be good
they fit my router and are easy to install and remove
i have had trouble with some ethernet cables in the past so i bought <NUM> different sizes of belkin and they all worked great
i even tested the cable and it was fine
i will definitely buy these again in the future .
i used this cable to hook up my bluray player to a ethernet switch
it was inexpensive and works great
would recommend it .
i needed a few of these for various internet enabled bits of kit and a few of these did the job and weren not overpriced for what it is
works fine !
good enough price , nice ends , good sheathing .
i returned it because the network adapter which i purchased in conjunction with your product didn not function well with my hdtv and my modem
i would have kept it had i had another use for it .
you can not beat the price , but if i were to buy one in the future , i would get a <NUM> or 15ft
i bought it for my bedroom and 7ft is pretty short to reach everywhere i want .
"" would be more accurate : a pair of flexible plastic "ears" guard the release lever that is the bane of normal cables , but those ears can bend down so that the lever is unprotected
otherwise , it is fine , and the price was right
i will buy more of these when needed .
this cable was exactly what i needed , and the quality , price , and speed of shipment was terrific ! the type of cable was the perfect speed , and complimented the rest of my system very well ! all i can say is thanks !
what can you say about a patch cable ? i chose the belkin product because i have used belkin for many years with no failures of any of their products
the products are reasonably prices and belkin has always maintained a high level of quality .
it is cat <NUM> cable with an on each end
what else is there to say ? it is portable and works .
what can i say , it is a ethernet cable , nothing special except for maybe the snagless ends
cable is from a reputable brand at an unbelievable price
great connection , doesn not come loose from my router ( or the wall )
also comes with a lifetime warranty so if anything goes wrong you are covered .
fast ethernet cable built to last
bought this as an extra cable in case i needed it
works like a charm and is a great asset to have
you can never have too many cables .
connects my pc , and my xbox to the internet
i cant think of anything negative to wright works well for what it is .
good cable
it is nothing special , but does everything i need it to .
they sent a different product
does not say that is made by belkin anywhere on it
they sent me a rj45 cable made by foxxconn <HASHTAG>
this does not have the protected cover isnagless' over the release lever , as shown in the picture/item description
i am not happy ; i do not plan to buy from this company again .
pros : cheaper than any brick and mortar
snagless design is nice
let is me get on the interwebz
cons : hasn not made me a blt
belkin should incorporate this into their next cat 5e design
tl ; dr : buy it
cat 5e cables are cat 5e cables , for the most part
but quality does show when you compare the lowest quality products to the highest ones
this cable has solid sheathing and well built ends which will probably last for many years even in somewhat abusive situations .
i got <NUM> of these cables in pink , since amazon was offering them as an add on item for a discounted price
i chose pink because it was less expensive than any other color by at least a dollar
so far they have been working perfectly , as most cables do .
i needed cable for specific purpose and and specific length and color
this was perfect and i would recommend to everyone
works great
 <NUM> feet , just to warn you all , unless you know for sure that the things you are connecting are gonna be close , could be a little tight , especially if you are going around a desk or something
looking for cables ? go with belkin , go with snagless
you will save yourself a lot of grief .
i can not complain too much -- it is cat5 cable , what is there to say ? it is a good price , and i like being able to get various colors because it helps with cable management
but this cable had a different sort of plastic sheath on the connector head than i am used to and i do not like that at all
in order to press the plastic release for the connector , you have to fit your finger between two raised edges
clearly this is to protect the release from the common breakage problem , and i appreciate the attempt
but this was too hard to use : couldn not release it with my thumb , had to use my index finger
plus you can not do it from the side , you have to have your finger at the correct angle , which can be a problem when you are under a desk with your hand snaked around behind your router or what have you .
there were needed in my computer/tv setup
they arrived on time
and they seem sturdy and well made
note that they are a full long .
came on time as expected - thank you amazon
works as expected - thank you belkin
what more is there ? plug it in !
once you see the price of these in stores you will appreciate the great prices here
ordered two of these and they work great and the snagless feature is a real plus
ordered two more to keep for back up
the different colors are nice also for identifying different computers or whatever you are using .
it works and it is <NUM> foot long
what more do you want from a <NUM> foot ethernet cable
wifi is great , but there is no substitute for in when i am playing starcraft ii .
not much to say about ethernet cables
i wanted a mix of different sizes as i rearranged my office , and it was easy to find on amazon
com .
needed a shorter cable to hook things up around the tv to a router
cable is good quality and works perfectly fine .
they are inexpensive , flexible , and work just fine
i am just using them in mundane applications
don not know how they'd work in high speed applications .
it is a cable , it transfers data
not much else to say about it
the price was right for the length that it was and connects my new desktop to the router .
simple , made sturdy and hooks up my mac and ps 3
would recommend to anyone and inexpensive
great buy all around .
it does what it is supposed to do
and well
i bought the pink 7ft cable and really like it
i took it to a workshop where no wireless signals were permitted ( radio telescope workshop
obvious reasons for that necessity ) , and everyone had ethernet cables and it was just a mess with all the cables and trying to figure out which went with which laptop , etc
but , thanks to this distinctive cable , i didn not have to be concerned with any of those issues--or with my cable magically disappearing ! ( which seemed to be the fate for a few of the many , many mundane blue ones ) .
i cannot recognoze well how long because i am japanese and the peoples other than us use metric unit
it doesn not wrok for my intension because too short !
belkin products are usually a good bet
this isn not complicated , it works fine and is what i expected it to be .
used the patch cord to connect my modem to a switch then from the switch to two rokus
good price and fast shipment .
i am so sick of most local stores overcharging for cables
i always try to buy my cables online
sometimes you don not really know what you are getting though
this one worked perfect and i would not hesitate to buy again
good cable , good price !
this ethernet cable works great and is cheap ! i think this is a good size for most purposes
it is not too long where it gets tangled up , but not so short you can not use it
i like the way it latches in ; this is a nice feature compared to other cables i own .
it is a good cable
the only thing i would change on it is to make the snagless attachment more like what is on the cables to go 27150
it is just a better design , but this one still does the job .
we bought two of these , basically because they were the cheapest <NUM> foot cable i could find on amazon
we have got other belkin equipment , and have been happy with it
but , to be honest i didn not expect much for that price
i figured it would be cheaply made , toothpick size cable , or the end locks would break right away
they were actually a pleasant surprise , especially for how cheap they were being sold
can not complain a bit .
great cable
no problems or issues
does what it needs to do
not expensive
i have bought many belkin products with no complaints .
great cord
does what it is advertised to do
can not beat the price and loved the color options , specifically the purple .
this cable was exactly what i needed , and delivered very quickly
no question that you will be happy with the purchase
if you need a 7' cable .
i bought two of these to connect my tv and my surround receiver through an ethernet switch to my router
plugged them in , everything worked ( netflix , internet radio ) and never looked at them again
for that price you can not make them on your own .
what you would expect from belkin
these are high quality cat5e cables and they work great to connect all my devices .
works great , the snagless head is good when you are pulling through areas so you don not snap the clip off the end .
this is a standard cable and does exactly what it is supposed to do
i am happy with the purchase .
this cable works and is cheap
the tabs haven not broken off after extensive use , and the rubber shield covering that extends up onto them for the &<HASHTAG> ; no snag&<HASHTAG> ; feature might be responsible for that , though it seems to be decent quality plastic ( not super brittle ) on the connector too .
bought the <NUM> ft gray cable : good price , works as advertised
the snagless feature is good to have since i have broken the plastic latch on other cables in the past
highly recommend .
good quality for your money
you don not have to spend more for a similar prodduct as this one
<NUM> stars .
well , its simply a cable
not much really to say about it , other than it works and its size met my needs - having different colors helps , that was the major reason behind this purchase - various cables to same location ( or even different locations i presume ) , all have different colors making identifying them easier when necessary ( couple times now , removing cables , checking link lights , etc
no problems since purchase though !
its a cat <NUM> cable good quality and seems to work well is kind of short though make sure you measure the run that you will be using it for before buying
it came on time and the cable works .
works as designed the price is just right
i will recommend this item to my friend , it works with the proper length .
at this price its probably a knock off but it shows 100m across so i don not care
i guess the snagless clips are pretty nice too .
it works great .
needed a couple of cables for a project i was working on and once again amazon had the best price compared to most of my local merchants
these worked , and are still working great for my application
thanks amazon .
ahhh its a network cable
works as expected , would give it <NUM> stars if it could talk to me but since it cant <NUM> stars will have to do
does the job i got it for at a stellar price
no complaints
buying from amazon saved me money
i would have paid a lot more had i gone to radio shack or best buy .
this cable was exactly what i needed , and the quality , price , and speed of shipment was terrific ! the type of cable was the perfect speed , and complimented the rest of my system very well .
i bought these because they are purple
good quality cables for a good price
really though , they are purple , and that is why i bought them .
the cable works as advertised
the connection is fast , and gives me no reason to be dissatisfied
a cable at this price cannot be beaten .
what can you say , it is a cat5 cable , has quality molded connectors , works , and was cheap
i carry with me on trips to plug into the connections at my hotel in various lengths , and belkin always delivers with quality cables .
this cable came at a good price and works flawlessly
i used it to increase my download speed by using the ethernet connection instead of the wireless
what more can you ask for ?
works beautifully
now i get to sit back and bask in the glory that is fast internet service from my modem to my router .
you could have paid much more money for the exact same cable
this cable works as well as one you might pay two to three times the price
recommend the product and the vendor .
works great
it is just ethernet cable
nothing special but perfectly fine as long as reasonably priced
seems to be well built and solid .
i bought them to replace the ones i have in use that have broken clips
next time i pull my computer mess err desk apart i will replace them .
it is cable
it works
it wasn not expensive
why do i need so many words for such a simple review ? one more word argh
rj45 cables are so common these days , you'd think everything would be worked out by now
apparently not so
the worst thing you can do to any electronic cable is kink it , bend it sharply , put a crimp in it
but my <NUM> footers , shown on amazon in an appropriately nicely formed loop , all arrived in a tight wad with sharp bends every <NUM> 1/2 to <NUM> 1/5 inches along the entire length , and then tightly bound in the middle with a wire tie
each kink even created a discolored joint on the cable jacket
cables don not like sharp bends ( mine have <NUM> tight bends along a 7' cable ) , those kinks make cables hard to string and route along small spaces , they make a rat is nest behind my comm gear , and they jeopardize the integrity of the cable
c'mon belkin , your "pro series" packaging is a silly gimmick , because at a thrifty $2
50 per cable , i am betting dollars to donuts there is nothing special about your cables , no rare metals , no exotic coatings , no braided stainless shielding
it is a generic ethernet cable
nothing more , nothing less
kindly treat it as such
treat them kindly and fore go the glitzy packaging
meanwhile , my 15' cables from mediabridge happily arrived in a simple cardboard box , in a neat 5" diameter coil
no kinks , no sharp bends
i try to order from mediabridge when possible because they seem to know how to package and deliver cables that work out of the box , no fancy packaging , no rocket science , no need to hang a cable for a week to work out the kinks , just a sound cable
unfortunately , they did not have when i needed them
so i went with belkin , after all it is just a cable
next time i will wait for mediabridge to .
it is ethernet cable
it is the right size
and it didn not cost an arm and a leg
the connections are well made
would buy again .
bought these to connect my router to all my home theater stuff
rasberry pi , etc
love the vibrant off beat colors .
its a jumper
cant say much more than that
nice quality
went from switch to internet ready device
ok .
i am guessing the "snagless" refers to the tall curves on either side of the clip on the ends of the cable
these tall tabs on both sides of the clip make it rather difficult to push the clip down when removing the cable , at least in tight places where you are limited in how you can twist your hand
meh , no big deal
the price is good , the black looks really darn good , and they do their job just fine !
it does what it is supposed to do and it does it well
fits perfectly and the casing is high quality .
i bought this to link my cable router to my bluray player for streaming video
works great , seems to be a high quality cable .
the cable did it is job
it arrived on time and was as expected
i needed a cat <NUM> cable to hook another pc to my network
it is nice having a <NUM> foot cable as opposed to the usual <NUM> foot
it worked out perfect with how i routed the cable to the ps3
looking forward to more great shopping on amazon .
fast shipping and this is a good quality item
simple to install , does what it is designed to do with no complications !
ya , this thing is pretty cool
i bought it to connect one electronic thing to another and to my surprise , it worked ! data is being transmitted as i type this thanks to this cord .
after always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables i bought a few of these
they work great and have nice clip protectors
handy to have a few extras of these around .
use it with my new docis <NUM> modem and wireless router , works like a charm , gives me great speeds
does exactly what it is advertised to do .
i am not sure there is a whole lot you can say about network leads , but i will try anyway : * it worked* the covering on the cable wasn not cracked anywhere* the rj45 connectors were intact and undamaged* i liked the grey , it really brought my room togetheryeah , that is about all folks .
middle of no where
my wireless card went out
at that time i did not even know what an ethernet cable was
however it got me up and going
with simple instructions off of youtube
there is not much to say about cable it works or not this 5e cable worked for my purpose it delivers my full broadband speed of 300mbps to my devices
basic wire
too pricy for a basic part made up of wiring and plastic
not much more to say .
the price on these cables is great
so much cheaper than most stores , and they come in many colors so that you can use multiples
packaging is easy to use , and completely frustration free
would buy again .
then why do you have to spend <PERCENT> more for it in a store than online
great quality and price .
yet another example of belkin getting it right ! this is not a unique is the right length
printers or other devices that are not immediately adjacent to all the other equipment need this length
another great product at a good price by belkin .
i bought this and plugged it in and have been using it without issues ever since
i'd buy this again .
what more can i say than it works and was inexpensive ! i generally get my cables from monoprice , but this is good , too .
no issues with this cable at all
the ends hold firm in my switch , and have survived about a half dozen unpluggings/repluggings
the molding around the plug is strong and the cables flexible
will buy again if need more
the product just works just fine
one thing you will notice about quality ethernet cables is where the insulation stops on the ends of the cable
if you are cable is filled with the plastic on the ends ( like this one ) you are getting a pretty good quality cable .
exceeded the use for what i needed
very good cord for the price
the &<HASHTAG> ; 5e&<HASHTAG> ; is for extra heavy duty wire gauge
hooks up in a snap and doesn not come out of the plug unless you need it to
the end plug is made with very good quality
thanks for sending it to me the way you did , i received it one day before the promised date .
good wire to connect my roku to router
it enhances the speed as it is fast as compared to wireless connection
i bought this product after doing a lot of price comparisons and reading reviews
i am satisfied with it
the cable is of good quality
i use it to connect my wired trendnet broadband router to my laptops .
not much to review here
they were inexpensive cat 5e patch cables
they work just fine
construction was fine
i would have no problem buying these again if i needed more patch cables .
these arrived in good condition
they have worked fine for my needs
it is a pretty straight forward product and i think belkin does a nice job with it .
seems to work fine and quality is comparable to products from electronics stores
this was half the price so that makes it a great bargain .
this cable does what it is supposed to do
it works ! what more can be said ? it is well made and performs to specs .
they worked fine and are well made
it is a cable but now i have to add <NUM> more words - there !
needed this for my computer and it works just as i need it too
nothing more , nothing less
would suggest to anyone with a computer .
the snagless part is really nice
most any problems i have ever had end up being broken ends and this type seems to solve that problem .
it is hard to review products that work as expected
a <NUM> foot cable for less than $3 can not be a bad deal anyway
this works as expected and was very inexpensive
grateful !
i love the price and free shipping with prime , this cable was a great buy and if i ever need another cable i will buy this one , i love the different ranges in length also
all around <NUM> stars on this product
these are well made cables with good features such as the molded guard for the release lever to keep it from catching when the cable is pulled back out of an installation .
this cable did what it was supposed to do , and was a great price
i did recently upgrade all of my cables , including this one , but not for any reason in particular .
i bought <NUM> of these so i could connect everything around my tv to the internet
( xbox 360 , playstation 3 , dvr , and a computer ) these cables are great , they are high quality , and have sturdy connectors
they are gigabit cables
i stream 1080p
mkv files from my laptop to my xbox <NUM> via windows media center , wireless n does not cut it , but these cables do the job
even though i doubt i will need speeds over 100mbps , i like having gigabit cables , and i like these cables better than the cheap blue ones on amazon
the cheap blue cables have weak connectors in my experience , and have broken off
i would definitely recommend this cable .
i actually ordered this belkin ethernet cable for it is certified status and did receive a new ( packaged ) belkin ethernet cable
plus , the price was the lowest i have found for this brand name cable
of course , it is working fine
it is manufacture and durability appear among the best
don not get me wrong , i use and am happy with the generics too
only difference seems to be the thicker construction of this belkin brand
i expect unparalleled performance and longevity from this cable .
it is as advertised and works extremely well
construction is above the standard
before there all gone &<HASHTAG> ; get one , now ! &<HASHTAG> ;
good network cable
it looks reliable and made of good quality plastic
i wish i got a longer one though .
what can i say ? it does what it is supposed to
no drama
for applications requiring a cable more than <NUM> feet , but less than 12
you know that , but i needed the extra words to fulfill review guidelines .
i love purple and this is really purple
the cord is good quality and i am happy , have gotten a few more since .
they work just like they should
always go for the design , so the little clippy thing doesn not break off due to your carelessness .
i don not no if their is much to say about a ethernet cable , but it feels like it has a solid build qualities
i have had no problem with the cable
i would recommend this item to anyone .
this is a quality product at a great price
works like a charm
should last for a very long time
does what it is supposed to do , with no snagging among cabling
quality product with sturdy construction and flexibility , and a nice gray color .
i ordered this cable to replace a nice red <NUM> footer that will work with my lan hookups , but notmy line <NUM> spider amp to peddle connection ?
go figure
the cable works great , and i don not have to use the 25' cable line <NUM> sent me ( 25 feet ? )
i ordered three of these , as every once and a while i need a shorty to run from wall connection to router , or router/wall to computer
it works great , and i have posted a photo of it , as one reviewer said he got a fake , so this is what it looks like in the package .
belkin cat5e snagless patch cable ( gray ) arrived before the due date and it was pachaged well
i sure like the color issue
all my cables are colored and i log them in a note book for easy access .
i like the snagless connection feature
otherwise it is your basic belkin ethernet cable for home or office networks
it is good .
i really like the isnagless' feature on this one
i have broken off so many of the little clips on other ethernet cables
i think this will be much better protected
the length is good
i can sit in an easy chair near my desk with the laptop , and the cord reaches , but it is not so long to be cumbersome when i am working on the desk .
i have used this product on multiple devices and some of them dont seem to hold together as well as others .
just after buying a new computer ( dell ) , i realized that it would be a good idea to replace my modem to computer ( cat5 ) cord
when the cords arrived , i connected them then logged on
could not believe the difference
i was using an older blue cord that i picked up from a family member
i ordered this cable because i wanted a longer cable , but was really happy and pleasantly surprised with the increased speed
we have sbc dsl elite , and everything is so much faster with the new belkin cat 5
i recommend this cat5 cable .
it is a cat <NUM> cable , you use it for networking
there isn not much to say besides that i suppose , but it is very good for the low price .
there is nothing bad to say about this cable
i bought three at once
they aren not the exact ones shown in the picture , or at least , the ends look different , but they still have the "snagless" design , albeit a slightly different one
still works just fine as far as functioning as an ethernet cable
i used it with my trendnet ethernet switch , with no issues yet whatsoever .
it is ethernet
as advertised
snag protectors work well
no complaints here ; would buy again
<NUM> more words required required required .
great cable
this cable is very rugged to use , the tab protectors are great since is really protects the tab .
snagless cables at an affordable price
just what i needed
the connector head was solid and felt like it had a good build quality .
it is hard to go wrong with a belkin product
they always do what they are supposed to do and for a reasonable price
it is hard to be too picky about a cable that plugs into your modem and computer , but it does seem to stay .
no complaints about this cable
functions perfectly , and is exactly as described
used for connecting desktop computer to an ethernet switch .
it is a great cable and easy to tell witch one goes where i highley recomend it to everyone it will not snag on anything
exactly as advertised and shown
nice quality , "" ( meaning it has a molded ridge on the cable end to help try to avoid snagging the port clip ) , and fully molded ( not crimped ) cables
a good buy , especially with prime shipping .
works well ! i needed a shorter cable that would not get in the way , but allow me to move away from my desk ( 7 foot )
i can enjoy higher speeds with this cat 5e cable connected vs my wireless connection
i like the snagless design it offers good protection from tab breakage
belkin international , inc
, is a american manufacturer of computer hardware that specializes in connectivity devices , headquartered in los angeles , california
i feel all warm and fuzzy supporting a american company
i have purchased belkin cables in the past and i still have a few of their cables laying around they are still working after years of use
i have some missing tabs on a couple of my generic cat 5e cables
this is the reason for my interest in belkin is snagless design
without the locking tabs the cables slip out if moved .
i bought several ( five ) of these so my network cables would match and each of them work perfectly as expected .
what can you say ? it works perfectly and is of high qulity .
there is not a lot to say about this cable but i have got to try since there is a minimum word requirement for this review - the cable is good , its the right length , it works .
always go cheap for digital cables
i found this same cable at for ten times the price
no difference what so ever .
this is a nice cable with dual ears to protect the tabs from breaking
they work like they should which is good
they are a little pricey for what they are
also note that the color is not the same as in the picture
these are light gray in color not dark gray .
i brought this cable when my old cable broke
i am use it to connect my computer and wireless route together
it is a good cable .
it was really cheap and shipped quickly
not too much that you can say about a cable except that it works
i needed a second one and this one did the trick .
hey , it is just a cat5e cable and it seems to work as intended
i didn not test it to see if it would work at gigabit speeds ( which a cat5e should ) but it works fine to connect my color laser printer to a local ethernet switch .
i got this cable to connect my laptop to the internet occasionally as the is pretty bad
the wire didnt look or feel like new and out of the box
i saw that there were bends and it felt cheap
i was going to return it , but it gets the job done and has no loss of speed
so for the price there are not a lot of complaints .
new , does the job and arrived on time
why would you pay two or three times more at an electonics store ? amozon is the place for all your cable needs .
just what they siad it would be and it works just fine
the color helps to see which item is pluged into which port .
solid , well built product
does the job
now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country
hate word length requirement when a few simple ones will do .
very good quality cable for a good price
i bought this for my desktop computer and they work great
the clip is not flimsy like most cables .
i have a htpc and even though its rare sometimes i do need to use a keyboard with it
i had a large print keyboard that is so easy to see in a not so brightly lit tv viewing area that i wanted to use
got this cable and routed it from the pc , around the back of the tv , and that puts the keyboard at a comfortable location for typing on .
this cable is not available in any store in our area so big thanks to amazon for making unusual items like this readily available to everyone everywhere
keyboard cables are too short and this was exactly what i wanted
being tipical belkin quality is obvious immediately & it works perfect
does not have that flatspot to plug into tower like the keyboard does so i marked the missing pin space with a majic marker on the cord to make finding the proper alignment easy to find when you want to plug it in again .
i needed to work on an old computer and needed more ps2 link
works as expected as an extension cable .
needed to extend keyboard for older style desk
six feet was clean , simple , and perfect fit
cable flexible enough to move well without being so stiff it hangs up .
this was a must have for my windows <NUM> keyboard ! i enjoy the classic keyboards and this made it that much easier to use !
great cable
works great and was plenty long enough for my purposes
belkin is a great brand for this kind of stuff too
this is just an extension cable to be used for a keyboard
most keyboards today have very short cables and this fixed the problem
you may want to tape the two cables together with electrical tape to prevent them from pulling apart but mine had not pulled out so far .
i needed this for my old computer , which i use when i want to pretend it is still the 90s
i had a slight fear that the extra length - my keyboard is already long cable plus this one - would cause problems with the strength of the signal , but everything is fine
and how sweet it is to finally be able to sit at my desk , far from that computer , without a keyboard cable stretched across my monitor screen .
this extension fits into my older pc is ps/2 port better than the cable from the keyboard ! the connection is snug , but not too tight
it works just as well on my new win <NUM> computer
i have got an old keyboard that is really great , so i am using it alternately for both computers .
work as they are supposed to
i sit about <NUM> or <NUM> feet away from my monitor , so these are perfect
i go through to many batteries in wireless keyboards and mouse is , so this has saved me tons .
if you want a longer cord on an older keyboard , this extension cable works great
keyboard plugs into it snugly and wont fall out easily while moving it around or lightly tugging on it .
it is belkin
what more to say ? nice tight connections and it works
probably will have only wireless mice soon , but this was handy when i needed it and it didn not give me any problems .
i have two of these connected together to extend my keyboard from the computer
i would definitely purchase again
thanks .
i use this to connect an old ps/2 keyboard to my htpc , and it works fine
i bought this to replace a generic brand that wore out , so hopefully this name brand will be better .
the configuration of my office made it impossible for my cpu and monitor to be close enough together to use the existing cables
so , i purchased these extension cables and they work beautifully
they were the exact same product as sold in stores for <NUM> times the cost and there is no loss of function
i would recommend this product to others needing just a little more length in those cables .
again and again i find stuff on amazon for far cheaper then in store
we have best buy where i live and have to go there for parts
they are so overpriced that i have stopped going there and am more then happy to wait for belivery
i am a pc gamer and play on a 55" in my living room
i had been using wireless keyboards but they always were haveing range or interference problems so i bought this cord
more then enuff length for me to use my keyboard anywhere in my living room .
don not quite understand what i need to say about this product , it is an extension cord , it extends the distance between the motherboard and the keyboard and/or mouse .
not much to say
belkin makes good products in general and this is one of them
i have purchased several of these for home and at the office
they work fine for both mouse and keyboard
i still use one of them ( in conjunction with a usb to ps/2 adapter ) for a usb mouse too , because that way i can use the ps/2 mouse port on my older computer and free up one of my usb ports , which i don not have enough of .
and it is screw handles are ribbed and very easy to grasp
nicely constructed .
well built
thumb screws are very ergonomic
i use these cables with standard external modems like the usrobotics 56k faxmodems
good value for the money .
what more can you say
it works like expected
the cable didn not appear to be cheaply made and all hardware interfaced using the cable worked perfectly .
this is a decent cable for the price
the connection of the cable to the connector is rugged and will resist breaking easily
cable is well insulated and connectors are of typical belkin quality
have used this in several environments including in the lab setting with satisfactory performance .
just what i needed to allow my users to connect to our cnc machines from their laptops
great price , i couldn not make them for this price .
this is basically just a to adapter
it has the normal specified pinouts on both ends , so it should work with almost anything
it will not work with things that use a proprietary pinout , such as point of sale ( pos ) machines
we use these for factory hardware and label printers .
i bought these almost three years ago
but you know what ? they are still hanging in my bar putting out good music
well , i play the good music
these just happen to perform the actions needed to make that sound audible
but that is beside the point
look , they are not like super subs
they are just well balanced affordable speakers that sound great in a bar
they get plenty loud and they look plenty good
i have mine mounted up on the ceiling and hardly anyone notices them
until they get their damn faces rocked off
should have paid attention , suckas .
i installed these in my garage and am very pleased with the sound and clarity
a salesman at a big box chain electronics store tried to talk me out of them , but for $30
00 , you just can not beat these speakers
they are easy to set up
anyone looking for an inexpensive speaker for a garage , patio or for a secondary stereo system would be very happy with them .
i used a pair of these speakers to set up what i called a "bubba vision" cheap home theater in my family room with an old sansui receiver , an inexpensive dvd player , and a jvc 27" tv
these worked very well , and were a considerable improvement over the speakers in the tv
however , it wasn not soon before i felt rather dissatisfied with them
not unhappy , but just aware that i was listening to a very well built but ultimately cheap set of speakers , so i resold them
however , i also own a pair of the audiosource ls200 speakers
they cost even less than these speakers , and to me have a bigger and warmer sound
i am still using those and plan to be for quite some time .
i bought these speakers for less than $20 and am very impressed with their quality
i put them on our patio and the entire area is filled with great sound ( the patio is about 15'x30' )
if you are looking for an inexpensive set of speakers for outside , this is your pair .
i bought these speakers to use on our deck and also to point out at our pool
i am amazed at the sound quality for such a small box
if you are looking for an inexpensive set of speakers to place outdoors then these are a perfect fit
i am going to order a second pair in order to increase my coverage area .
i bought these several years ago for listening outside on my <NUM> acres of property
4 speakers for my backyard but i can hear these from the front yard and when i am in the woods too
i bought these as a cheap unknown brand speaker that i could use and abuse while leaving them out in all weather conditions
rain , snow , ice and a few hurricanes through the years and getting knocked around by kids
the sound quality and sound output surpassed my expectations
the overall construction surprised me too as they lasted several more seasons than i thought they would ( 6 years now and all year long outdoor usage )
due to the fact that i crank up the volume very high for when i am mowing , or deep in the woods or having a crazy pool party , with or without other people : )
i am now looking into buying a replacement for one speaker that seems to be on it is way out
it still puts out sound but poor quality compared to the other 3
just a good all around speaker that does not break the bank .
these speakers sounded great but i do like to crank up the occasional kiss or vanhalen and these speakers just stopped working
i have never blown a speaker before but i guess that is what happened .
my brother and i bought a set of klh <NUM> speakers <NUM> or so years ago for my father to replace some old larger speakers in his house , and they are the best value speakers i have ever seen
we liked them so much we got a second set to replace the other set of speakers on his stereo
these little guys really deliver a great range of sound in a small package
it is not suprising to me that klh is still making this exact model this many years later
you can not find another <NUM> way sound speaker at this price
also , they are durable and are weather resistant
i don not recommend leaving them on a patio in a monsoon or a blizzard , and the black doesn not make good friends in bright sun , but you can mount these to the porch or patio roof/overhang and leave these out in damp weather with no loss of wear or sound , at least not as of yet
the more i looked around at different facilities with pa or sound systems outdoors , the more i have noticed these speakers being utilized
so if you have just a few bucks and want to some aged speakers , this is the perfect little set to get
everybody thinks bigger and pricer is better , but i have to argue that these speakers have done their job superbly , and thats why my dad still uses them <NUM> years later
this <NUM> set of klh speakers are actually identical speakers to the <NUM> models , but run a watt range whereast the <NUM> series runs watt range
so don not break the bank if you want a set of small speakers , i think you will be suprised
note , as with many small speakers , if you are a bass sound fan , then you might want to buy a , but these do a fine job at normal range .
to me , kensington is a name that project notrust'
this was priced right and works great
good cord length .
i love this ! it comes with matching tags
we always have a mess of cords over by our tv
between all the components it is iimpossible to tell what is what
not anymore
you just tag it with the matching color , up by where you plug it in
i love this , and it comes with a great warranty , which also sold me
worth the little bit extra , imo ,
i have these all over in my house ! they work great ! i had one for many years that i paid over $50 for but i got my money is worth for sure ! so when i was able to see these on amazon for less money , i was happy ! they work well , they allow you to plug up many things and move freely
the cord from the power strip is average length but it does the job ! i would recommend .
purchased six of these for use in our store
they are durable , with an <NUM> foot grounded cord
amazon is <NUM> product description indicates <NUM> joules protection - <NUM> model has <NUM> joules @ <NUM> clamping volts
will certainly purchase kensington surges again .
this is a great power strip
i use it in my office and there is enough room between each plug that it doesn not matter how big the plug next to it is , it does not interfere
i also really enjoy the design and colors
having a quality item that also looks great it just an extra plus in my book !
this surge protector is super cute and can handle your tv and other big items
i bought two of these just because it is awesome looking
this is a brilliant product
it is so helpful to not have to tug and pull and guess which cord is which
i love that they added tape so you just put matching tape on each end of the cord and pull the cord into the coordinating plug .
i got this strip because i was living in a mobile home and wanted to protect against surges on my computer
this did just that .
with two very young children , our outings can be very unpredictable
time is tight too
the motorola 280 is have been a great time saver
sometimes we split up in the mall
one of us goes to do some shopping while the other has fun with the kids
we don not have to worry about setting up a time and place to meet up
it is easy to ask a question or change/make plans from 1/2 mile away
we use it on hikes and while walking around the neighborhood
they are also great when you are travelling with more than one car
the range is supposed to be about <NUM> miles
it can differ depending where you are
everything i have said is a good reason to by any radio
why did i choose this model even though it costs a lot more than some of the other ones ? -they are compact
even more compact than the the 280 is that take regular batteries
their size makes them easy to bring along anywhere
they also have a removeable belt clip
clip them on your pants or belt or remove the clip and they slip easily into your pocket
-they are rugged
the 280 is survived drops onto pavement and gallons of baby drool
-they have <NUM> channels and <NUM> privacy codes
if you go somewhere where there is a large crowd , you will run into other people with radios
the extra channels help you find a quiet channel
however , we rarely have to change channels
we have had ours for almost <NUM> years now and they have been very useful .
for the price , and the brand name , motorola is frs radios should be more durable - these don not last long in average use ( either business use by it professionals , or the real torture test , with boys ) .
if you have children who like to roam , then the motorola talkabouts are essential equipment ! i have used them to keep in touch with my children when they have played in different soccer fields , when they ride their bikes in the park , when camping , picnicing and hiking
the units are easy to use , even for a
it makes them feel important , too , so they willingly keep in touch
i have found the talkabouts to easily withstand the rigours of active boys , and the reception has been good , even in areas
battery use is reasonable , the units are tough and easy to use
any parent will find a use for these !
my husband , young daughters and i own horses , and trailride at least once a week
santa brought us four of these lovely little this year at christmas , and i couldn not be more pleased
we have had none of the troubles noted in the other reviews , ( although we don not ride on mountaintops ) , and my children find the radios simple to use and easy to understand ( not to mention the cool factor ! )
the radios are durable ; we have dropped them in snowbanks , had them grawed on by curious horses , and thumped around in saddlebags
they are certainly useful , we know if one of us gets separated from the others they will be able to radio in and figure out where we are
and for what we use them for , they are just perfect
we looked at a bunch of gps handhelds , and decided we didn not need anything quite that high end
for the average family who hikes or skis , trailrides or just goes to the mall of america , these are the perfect belt accessory
go for it !
fabulous product - works great - highly recommend - have used on my friends boat and it is great when we are on shore and need some one to come retrieve us - also works great on the boat that is <NUM> feet long

for best results , you should run the "parallel port accelerator" program when the unit is connected
computers have a limit on the number of ide devices , and desktop computers have a limited number of bays
the disks are easily replaced to provide vast storage within the 100mb limit
this device must be connected when all power is off , like with a parallel port printer
backing up a small amount of data is not a problem , but large amount of data files will run slowly
the fastest transfer is with an internal ide zip device
the "user is manual" warns against using the operating system to copy a disk
use the iomega "copy machine" program
right click on the zip drive to select the iomega "format" function
use "short format" to delete all data on an iomega disk
the "long format" repairs a drive with errors , converts from another format , or removes all passwords
"write protection" protects against writing over data , a password can protect against both reading and writing files
you can also flag the zip drive as "" so it appears like a hard drive
the manual has the details
most printers will operate from the printer port on this unit
the manual offers suggestions if this doesn not work
parallel port drives have their drive letter ( s ) assigned after the hard drive
another parallel port unit can be connected to the first ( "daisy chaining" )
this changes the drive letter ( s ) assigned to
a usb drive has its drive letter assigned after the drive letter ( s )
both units have been proven useful over time
will the data on a disk survive for over a decade ? not with some floppy disks
few hard drives survive <NUM> years of daily use
all your important data files should be copied from a hard drive to zip drives or other media
zip drives , like floppies , should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat
cds can be damaged by high heat
zip disks are reusable , replacing data does not decrease the size
a cd disk consumes space when a file is replaced
both can have labels
some say zip drives are obsolete , but not as long as it works for you
a zip disk has no compatibility problems between different systems and computers
a cd written on one system may not be updated by a different system
to test the status of a used zip disk
1 ) right click on the drive , select `properties'
2 ) select the iomega tab ( after support was installed )
3 ) select `diagnostics' , then `close' after the green light
4 ) select `more info' on the `disk type' note the `disk life status' and the `format life status'
percentages lower than about <PERCENT> are not good
5 ) a `long format' can improve the life status statistics
if your system does not recognize your used parallel port drive ( add new hardware wizard ) , select the hardware from the list : "scsi controllers" , "iomega" , "iomega parallel port interface" , then "finish" .
i have had my zip drive for almost <NUM> years and it has worked great
although the performance of the drive has been great i find that the media to be too expensive and much larger than the comparable ls120 drives
another suggestion is your buying this drive to use it for fast access to your files , don not go with the parallel
instead go with the internal ide or the scsi
both of these are at least twice as fast as a parallel drive .
i have a <NUM> that i use this drive on
i am so surprised at the speed that it reads the info through the parallel port
i had heard that the parallel port could be slow with a zip drive , but it seems to work about the same speed as an atapi drive i had preinstalled on my pii 400mhz
the price is right for zip drives
don not bother with the <NUM> mb drive - disks are more and not enough people have the drives yet that support them .
i have enjoyed the convenience of my zip drive- my university is graphics computers have zip drives , the local kinkos have zip drives in their computers , my parents even have a zip drive now
its a nice , accepted standard , and for the price the disks read fast and work well- unlike 3
5 floppies , no zip disk has ever corrupted data for me
zip disks are made of sturdy plastic which you can safely keep in your ( shirt ) pocket without damage
the strongest competetitor to the zip disk standard is the <NUM> mb , which is a drive that is with 1
6 mb ( traditional ) 3
5 floppies , so you can totally replace your old floppy drive and still have it when you need it
a couple years ago it was expected that this drive would blow iomega zip out of the picture , but haven not really caught on
in terms of exchanging data between computers in the same house , it is suprisingly simple to run an ethernet network instead- and there are other advantage besides transfering files- such as printer sharing and web sharing
i think the zip <NUM> is more functional for the price than the <NUM> zip
- ( for backing up really large files , the best thing these days is a cd writer or
this thing is now just a blue brick in the corner of my room
i tried to download the driver from a website but no such website exists
i could download it from the from pirate bay , but that is illegal and unsafe
so i have all these pictures of dear family members ( some of them are dead ) , and i can not retrieve them !
i am a mac user , but i also have a windows pc in my office
my workplace has over 1 , 000 employees and the majority of them are on windows , while i am one of <NUM> people in the organization that consistently uses a mac
i am sent files all the time via the network groupware system
i never wanted to hook my mac up through all the logging in and everything involved in a novell system , so i never got the mac version of the software to connect my mac fully to the network
so , when someone sends me a file via groupwise , i copy the attachment onto my zip disk and then eject that disk and put it in my mac to work on the file
not the most efficient way to go about things , but this 100mb iomega zip drive hasn not failed me once in the past <NUM> years
since the mac os can read both mac and pc zip disks , i use pc formatted disks and move them back and forth from windows ( the parallel drive ) to mac ( the factory installed 250mb drive ) all day long
zip disks can hold an equivalent of about <NUM> floppy disks and the speed is lightning fast when compared to floppies
my only gripe is that iomega does not make these drives with an on/off switch
even if your computer is off for a week , you have got to unplug your zip drive if you don not want it to eat up electricity
honestly , i doubt that a little zip drive that isn not spinning a disk uses more than a single kilowatt hour per month , but it is a waste nonetheless
this one gripe wasn not enough of a drawback to take a star away from the <NUM> star rating i am giving this gizmo
it is dependable , it is fast and zip is an industry standard
hats off to iomega .
this device has essentially been eclipsed by its own success
now the only for older machines ( more than <NUM> years ) , or for mobile professionals who want to make absolutely sure that they will be able to connect a zip drive to any pc they encounter , this most basic zip drive should be avoided by most purchasers
fact is , if you need to be mobile with your zip , you should go the usb route these days
every new pc and macintosh comes with usb connectivity , and the difference in access speed is great enough to justify the minimal extra cost
this parallel port machine is the very slowest zip drive available
if you download files of any size ( 1m or more ) you will notice the difference
you will also notice the difference between this model and an internal model
make sure that you really need to be mobile with the drive itself before you choose an external model
as has been stated in other reviews , the has become something of a standard nowadays , and many machines come with a zip drive
also , even though the price is attractive , think carefully about choosing this model if you plan to do much printing
most printers use the parallel port , and although you can hook up both a printer and this drive to the same port , you can not use both simultaneously
this is disasterous if you attempt to print a file from the zip drive
it can be done , but it takes a lot longer than printing from other drives
also , forget about accessing the zip drive if you have sent a print command
your parallel zip drive will be unavilable for the duration of the print
having said all this , i absolutely agree with other reviewers who praise the format
it is got the installation of any zip format , so chances are you will be able to port your data more successfully with a than any other format
true , 100mb is starting to look like small , but it is still an awful lot of room for almost everything but , video
still , i have to give this product fewer stars than it would have deserved two years ago , simply because iomega has come out with better stuff in the interim
for many users , it would be wiser to buy an internal
or , better still , buy an external usb for current compatability , and leave the internal bay available for future installation of a
that way , you will create a removable media solution that handles both past and future needs .
the zip100 is a minimum necessity for today is larger and larger file formats - mpeg , mp3 , and multiple images files can easily run up to 100mb
i have used the zip since its inception when it knocked old syquest 88mb drives out of business about <NUM> years ago
the size and convenience is why there is really only one choice for removable media with easy and immediate capability
there are definite pluses and minuses
some will say get a ( w ) drive - but burning a cd is definitely not as immediate as a zip
the parallel port is a major bummer because of the
but those of you who are not major speed demons won not be disappointed compared to a floppy
the zip drive allows daisy chaining so you can connect/output to other peripherals
iomega cut cost on the power on/off ( it is always on when plugged in )
but really the overall design is very good - you can place it flat or vertical
even though the thick parallel cord may tend to twist the main unit
there are a plethora of other iomega choices
and i would really ask yourself if you are planning on usb or scsi - each are noticeably faster
on the plus side , the 100mb format is so common in print shops , university labs , and copy places that you can not go wrong
plus the price of each disk is recognizably less than the 250mb
seriously think about your file formats
if you plan to do a lot video - you will need to go with a jaz
and you can get these refurbished for about the same cost and hold 1gig
the only barrier to entry is the scsi necessity and the extra cost of disks
overall , the zip100 has been a major workhorse for me - back and forth between work and home/mac and pc ms98/nt
it has performed flawlessly .
best buy
excellent quality
thinest case around .
this slim case will give your palm quite an elegant touch
it is also lightweight and compact , and it will store your palm , as well as some business cards and/or credit cards
i personally preffer the hard cover , which has a more modern look and protects the palm better
nonetheless , i use the slim leather case when i go to elegant social events because it is slimmer and less heavy , so it is easier to carry in your coat pocket .
this is a nice case
bought it for my dad is m515 and out of the box it didn not fit because the stylus insert is too large for the accessory slide but he was able to modify the case so that it does fit
he likes it !
this is a decent case for carrying your palmpilot
a lightweight metallic case with hinges might be better
actually , i don not know anybody that carries this device and i haven not for <NUM> years , but the case was good .
if you have a palm v or vx this is the case to get
the vx is a classy looking palm
the case makes the vx into a porche
the combination of the two is terrific-- performance and looks
there is one problem with turning the power but a software hack fixes this
a great gift idea for an intelligent businessman or woman
the more you use these t devices the more you will come to depend on them
if you want to use this as a wallet , it is a good option
i like to keep my wallet trimmed down without a lot of junk
this is not a real wallet so you can not accumulate junk in here
the palm vx complements this in that you can quickly enter whatever receipt information you might normally accumulate in your records , expenses , etc
and toss those out or if you want to keep them dump in a monthly file folder
i strongly recommend the combination of this wallet and the vx .
i have used this case for almost <NUM> months and still having difficulties when trying to put it in my shirt pocket
forget about putting some credit cards in it , because it gets thickeri gives a lot of protection for the palm , but it affects the best characteristic : sizei have been alternating this case with the original cover , depending the ocassion and the clothes i am going to wear ( in order to carry it in a comfortable and practical way )
this was the first case that i had for my palm
there is no doubt that it a good case and it looks really nice with the vx
with the case on , it very little to the overall size of the palm
the silo design of the vx which allows you to attach the case to the palm was ingenious
it a huge leap in case design compared to the velcro concept of may pda is
as for this case it is made of high quality leather and it a loop/strap design that i also liked
velcro and the button proved that after prolonged use , it tends to rip
the loop/strap design secures the case very well and it still looks very elegant
however like many leather products , they tend to warp and deform after a while
just think of your wallet and how deformed that can get
if your going to be putting it in your pocket a lot , i suggest you go with the hard case
however if your going to be putting it in a bag or brief case , then this case will be fine
although the case has slots for credit cards or business cards , realistically you wouldnt want to put more than two credit card and <NUM> business cards in it at one time
it does a lot to the bulkiness of the case
personally i only carried <NUM> business cards in it at one time
reatively speaking i wanted a case that was smaller then this one because it got a little too big for my pockets , whether it be the shirt or pant pocket
i found that not only was the hardcase by palm smaller and almost weighed as much , it also protected it just as well
also the fact that the powerbutton was often times turn on when using the leather case convinced me to change to the hard case
dont get me wrong
i really like this case
the hard case just fit my needs for a case a lot better then the slim leather case
the best thing i can suggest is to try both of them out before you actually buy it
a lot of stores will let you try on the case
thats really the best way to determine which one will really work for you
i wonder if this will fit the m500 series
hmmm .
as a heavy user of my palm ( which i access dozens of times a day ) , the palm slim leather case is perfect for my needs
i prefer it over other cases for the following reasons : the first is portablity
i take my palm everywhere with me ( even to the little boy is room )
and with the case is slim size , my palm fits easily into my front pants pocket
( carrying my palm in my shirt pocket is also an option
but since my company switched to business casual attire , i no longer wear dress shirts with pockets to work
hooray ! ) the second reason is convenience
with the palm rail system , the unit is held securely
and when i need to sync , the case slides off cleanly ( the rail system being a simpler and much more elegant solution than the pocket or velcro holding methods of other products )
the third reason is protection
the rigid cover is slightly padded , and the loop closure is very secure
( before adopting this case , i once used another cover -- without a loop closure -- which failed to protect my palm when i accidentally dropped it in the street while i waited on the curb for a cab
) the loop closure is also easy to open , so access to my palm is not restricted
my last reason for selecting this case is its ability to hold business cards
i put my business cards ( a whole slew of them ) in the large inside pocket , and i put my kids' doctor and dentist appointment reminders in the multiple credit card slots , none of which i want to carry in my wallet ( which is already filled with plenty of other stuff )
since my palm is always with me , i am never without a business card , so i never miss an opportunity to have my name remembered by the many new customers or vendors i meet
( as a comparison , many of the hard cases are very stylish
but since they can not carry business cards , they aren not really adequate for my needs
) for a great combination of style and function that is perfect for a heavy palm user like me -- the palm slim leather case is ideal !
i got this case because i had two needs
i wanted to protect my palm v from the frequent falls out of my front coat pocket ; but i didn not want to significantly increase its size and weight
this case fits both bills nicely
the added bulk and texture of the leather holds the palm in your pocket for that split second necessary to grab it before it falls ; and when it does fall , even if it lands on a corner , the screen doesn not crack
just what this doctor ordered
i use the pockets to store a couple of cards , nothing more
works like a charm
the clasp is sort of odd , just a tab of leather slipping into a buckle
a snap or velcro would have been nicer , but so far it does hold closed on its own
the leather smells nice and has been wearing well
the little palm logo embossed on the front is sort of cute , too
overall i am happy with this case and the price is certainly right .
the quality of the product is excellent except that it serves as a big impediment for when you charge on the palm cradle
this won not fit inside the palm cradle .
unlike my other reviews which usually take up a page or so , this product is rather straight forward
first and foremost i must say that this case sure beats the hell out of the hard case , which is also manufactured by 3com , in both form and function
second it can hold credit cards and money to be used as a second wallet , although it is not a great idea to use it as a primary substitute
and thirdly , the hard case is about ten dollars more than the leather case and is not nearly as good
however , like all things , it does have it is downsides
it is biggest flaw , like with other cases , is that it makes placing the palm in the craddle ( while still in the case ) a little more difficult
you basically need to place the craddle up on something ( cup for example ) and pull back both sides of the case all the way and then you can recharge
secondly , the pockets are made so stiff inside that it is very tricky to get both money or credit cards into or out of the pockets , which is why you might want to stick to a regular wallet
and thirdly , if you place the cased palm in a tight space like a bag or something , there is a chance that the edge of the case will hit the power button and cause it to turn on
this is not a big deal since it will shut off automatically after a minute or so , however it can become annoying when you haven not charged your palm in a while and you find that your battery is dying for some strange reason
all in all , you can not do much better than this case for only $19
95 , and while there may be more expensive cases on the market , they are all variations of this simple design
however , i would say that it would be nice it 3com or palm would make a case like this that went all the way around the palm for protection on all sides , since something can get caught between your palm and the case and end up scratching the screen ( which almost happened to me )
final thoughts : nice leather , don not expect it to take the same beating as the hard case , but unless you plan to go hiking with your palm , don not shovel out the extra ten bucks for a shoddy hard case , get this nice leather one instead
revuman : stay tuned for more reviews
peace !
nice looking , good feel
but my rail pulled off the rubber binding after <NUM> months of light use .
one of the nice features of the palm v is its slim size
if the manufacturer of this case would leave out the credit card/cash pockets , it would definitely be a plus
i have not had the accidental turn on problems others have had , but i think when the case softens up a bit after use this could be a serious issue
i have got friends who switched over to the hard case , which isn not as &quot ; sumptuous , &quot ; but fits well , will not accidently push any of the buttons , and is a bit thinner .
this product does its job : which is to protect the palm
( they can , and do , break , you know , if you drop them without protection )
the strap holds the palm in the case securely , as does the ingenious docking mechanism
there are slots for two or three credit cards and a side slot for some cash
but this only works as a wallet in a pinch
on the down side , the case does roughly double the depth of the palm vx , but the way i see it , that is the price of protection .
iomega zip <NUM> portable usb drivethis unit is identified by its translucent light blue rectangular box
it uses a separate power supply
the model number is zip100usb
it can operate either horizontally or vertically ( like a floppy drive )
a device that connects with a usb cable requires windows <NUM> or later
you should use the software eject command to remove a zip disk in windows <NUM> because the disk caching system may have data that needs to be written out
the iomega software should be installed in windows <NUM> instead of the support
the "user is manual" warns against using the operating system to copy a disk
use the iomega "copy machine" program
right click on the zip drive to select the iomega "format" function
use "short format" to delete all data on an iomega disk
the "long format" repairs a drive with errors , converts from another format , or removes all passwords
"write protection" protects against writing over data , a password can protect against both reading and writing files
you can also flag the zip drive as "" so it appears like a hard drive
the manual has the details
computers have a limited number of ide devices and drive bays so a separate storage device is practical
replaceable <NUM> mb zip disks provided vast storage in the past but are no longer the latest in storage technology
but the <NUM> mb zip disk is almost as universal as the floppy disk when you have a parallel port drive for older systems
the zip disks reuse deleted space unlike a cd whose space is consumed when you replace files
falling prices for cd discs solved that problem
a zip disk has no compatibility problems between different systems and computers
a cd written on one system may not be updated by a different system
to test the status of a used zip disk
1 ) right click on the drive , select `properties'
2 ) select the iomega tab ( after support was installed )
3 ) select `diagnostics' , then `close' after the green light
4 ) select `more info' on the `disk type' note the `disk life status' and the `format life status'
percentages lower than about <PERCENT> are not good
5 ) a `long format' can improve the life status statistics .
i bought my first zip drive ( parallel port ) a long time ago , and replaced it with a usb/ model a while later
i am still using it , and it works
the disks have a higher failure rate than the drive , but working after all these years .
was sort of perfect for my needs : using an obsolete storage system to take obsolete writing files from an older mac and copy them to an emac
i then had to convert to a current word processing software , opensource
org and then my intent was to plug this zip drive into my imac and copy all those newly translated files to the imac
but for some reason my imac couldn not &<HASHTAG> ; see&<HASHTAG> ; or read the iomega zip drive ( it &<HASHTAG> ; saw&<HASHTAG> ; it at the usb hub )
so i had to buy a flash drive to copy those files from the emac
then i was able to copy to the imac from the flash drive
( their customer support said the drive had been tested through mac os 10
6 and it worked fine [have 10
5 , mountain lion] )
in a round about way , the technology served its purpose ! thank goodness
( the seller was quick in responding to my questions
good customer service
i bought this to read some old zip disks i had lying around
i wanted to save the old files
i bought my zip drive from seller elizabethleehr and even though it was used , it ran on my win7 laptop flawlessly
no driver needed ; pure ! of course , zip drives eventually all develop the syndrome , so i can only rate this <NUM> stars !
this is the perfect product to back up file , photos , vieo clips , mp3s
great performance , fast transfer rate , not very noisy at all comparing to an i own
i recently bought a zip 250mb , and so far it is get my thumbs up ! full compatibility with the 100mb disks
if you want a portable storage device put your money on a zip drive
&amp ; media are great
the only drawback is the media being used over and over
cds aren not a very reliable comparing to cartridge disks
cartridge disks are more reliable and last longer in the processes of everyday backups of your files
and keep in mind that the zip drives or less expensive and are easily transported anywhere , easy to install and work with
mine is been working flawlessly since i bought it in early 2000
i understand the newer models are
if for some reason you can not have a power strip , that is a concern , but i do wish the ac adapter was smaller
gotta love the way it shoots zip disks half way across the room , too ! i recommend this drive for , low demand storage and backup
now if only zips would come down in price .
i had backed up a legacy computer on zip disks and stored them away
( i now use thumb drives and
) when i needed some old material from the old computer , i could not read the zip disks without getting a new drive
this convenient usb zip drive was just what i needed
it was shipped promptly and in excellent condition
it saved my life on this occasion .
my zip drive finally went out
it worked for at least ten years
current usb drives have more capacity and are a lot cheaper
one can buy a 128mb usb drive for $2
99 dlls !
i got <NUM> yes answers to my question about whether this iomega zip drive works in windows <NUM> before i bought it
no one however who answered had ever actually tried it in win 8
the software for this drive took down win 8 , and i had to do a reset to get it to restart windows
major flaw
it does not work in windows 8 , acer computers
i have applied for a refund
update : i tried to load it after the fail on win 8 , on a laptop i have with win 7
after loading the software , windows would not start , and still will not
i would not try it on win <NUM> unless you know what to do when it won not start
i have to have mine repaired , and minimum repair is $70
that is a high price to pay for just trying a product that was defective .
i purchased a zip to keep from loosing files
if system crashed
not realizing the zip would stop working first
found a refurbished more updated with usb and i am in heaven
now i can travel with it .
item was delivered on time and in good condition
all the essential parts were in the package ( power cord , and usb cable )
the zip drive works great
i am very satisfied with the product .
since i was out of internal bays and i still needed a zip drive for my pc , i purchased the portable usb model and it has worked just fine
no glitches in either the installation or operation
i don not quite get the translucent blue case ( oh yeah , it works with the mac , too ) but other than that , no complaints
now that is high praise , indeed , these days !
as it makes little sense for the 100mb to be the original zip you put on a new system anymore , most people who buy this product will probably be upgrading from an old parallel version
to be sure , it is an improvement on that device
it is noticeably faster
but it is smart for only a couple of very specific kinds of user
the first is the "backup bandit"
if you only use your zip drive for routine , automated backup of files that fit easily onto a single 100mb disk , it is unlikely you need much more than this device
the second is the "i' geek"
if you have a huge library of zip <NUM> disks already amassed , and the average file size is above 10mb , then there is an argument to be made for staying with this product
notice that i am talking here about a library of truly big files , typically graphics
if all you have is a massive library of text documents , you shouldn not fear switching over to the zip <NUM> at all
in my opinion , anyone else should go for the usb version of the zip 250 , and add on a firewire adapter when it becomes available
why ? well , the zip <NUM> usb with firewire is simply the most flexible zip out there
you can use it on literally any system that has at least usb ports , can achieve the lightning speeds of internal scsi zips if the computer has firewire ports--and you don not have to sacrifice a scrap of portability
while the zip <NUM> here can be fitted out with a firewire adapter , it can not use zip <NUM> disks
true , the zip <NUM> is mysteriously slower than a zip <NUM> if the files are something above 10mb
but you will never notice the difference with the vast majority of files
what you will notice if you spend any time seriously archiving your work is how nice it would be to have a little bit more room on a 100mb disk
the zip <NUM> solves that problem by giving you a lot more room to play in
in particular , the 250s are obviously to sharing larger multimedia files between computers , or even between platforms
finally , the <NUM> simply looks cooler
those looks even translate into utility , because its trim profile really does make it a little easier to carry
in fairness i should point out that the 100mb appears to have a substantially lower price tag
but it is not , really
you pay on average 1
5 times as much for zip <NUM> disks ( per megabyte of storage space ) than for zip 250s
long term , your storage savings with a zip <NUM> more than make up for the difference between the two models .
if you are like me and have a digital camera that uses compact flash and a laptop that always has a free pcmcia slot , this is an excellent value
leave it in your slot all the time , it won not have an effect on your system when the cf card isn not in , but it will permanently add a cf slot to your system
this means that you can dispense with the cable and just plug the card into the slot
when you do , it will be recognized as a removable disk , kind of like a syquest or zip disk , and show up in your &quot ; my computer&quot ; view or mac desktop , and maybe ( this is how nikon view works anyway ) pop up your digicam software
this really is by far the most convenient way to deal with a digital camera if you use a laptop .
i plugged this adapter into my new dell laptop and it brought up my compactflash card as an additional hard drive in windows 2000 , no software or additional drivers required
i was then able to browse and even edit pictures on the card as if it were a disk drive
truly amazing
all peripherals should be this easy to install and intuitive to use .
cf readers with usb cords ? why bother ? say goodbye to those bothersome cords ! this cf adapter is the answer to keeping your portable computer portable
one little adapter allows you to plug in your compact flash cards for quick and easy reading
i bought this item when i purchased my latest digital camera and it has been a blessing ! it is so simple to use , , compact -- and incredibly inexpensive ! how simple ? plug your cf card in one end , plug the adapter with card into the appropriate slot in your laptop and the computer is ready to read and write to the cf card just like it was another drive
how sweet is that ?
i use a viking 128mb compactflash card in my canon s200 digital camera
simply plugging the card into this reader and the reader into the pcmcia slot on my mac tibook automatically launches iphoto and imports the contents of the card into the laptop
much faster and certainly more elegant than carrying around cables and using the camera battery
highly recommended !
adapter works fine -- laptop is <NUM> years old , but everything worked fine
good price at amazon .
it works fine under windows me , 2000 , and xp , because you dont need drivers , i read a bad review for this item , and let me tell to the autor : or you have an old windows version ( 98 or 95 ) or you need to contact support , but not for this device , you need suport for the cf card developer , because this its just an adapter
its faster than usb readers ( max 12mbps ) and of course really more faster than cable connection from the device ( 1
2mbps ) , the speed limit its the speed of youre cf card ( more than 12x its great ) .
i just plugged it in and it simply worked -- both on my powerbook <NUM> running os 8
6 ( which exploits it as an extended memory hack ) and on my titanium powerbook running os <NUM> and os x
i have iphoto set not to launch when the card is inserted on the tibook
i gave <NUM> stars because it arrived quickly and did the job as advertised with no hassles
( to merit <NUM> stars , it should have had better documentation and a more detailed troubleshooting guide ) .
this adapter works great for quickly moving digital images from cameras to your pc
the only problem i have with it relates to the overall length of the card
they should have made it 1/2 inch longer so you could remove it more easily from the pc card slot
when inserted , it is &quot ; flush&quot ; with the pc .
it does what is says it does , the only downside i can think of is , that it does not have an eject button for the cf card , so when the card fits tight , you have to remove the pcmcia card to actually get the cf card out .
this is a great little piece of hardware
i have used mine in both a dell latitude running winxp and an apple ti800 running mac os x
it is the only way i transfer pictures now
much easier to carry than a usb cable , plus it is faster , does not use up the batteries on the camera , and just flat out works perfectly
here is how i use it : i take my picutres ( duh ; - ) , remove the cf card from the camera and insert it into this adapter
then i insert it into the laptop
under both windows and mac , the cf card appears as a removable drive on the computer
under windows , i navigate through a couple of folders to where the pictures are stored and copy them to a folder on my hard drive
on the mac , iphoto automatically opens up ( because i have told iphoto to startup automatically when a camera is connected ) and it gets ready to transfer the pictures
i can then tell it to copy the pictures to my photo library , and delete the originals
it does just that
then on the mac and pc , i tell the operating system to eject the drive/device , then i can pop the adapter out of the computer
of course you can pop it out whenever you want , but you will definitely risk something bad , better to eject it the proper way
i can transfer a full <NUM> mb flash card to my computer is a minute or so
fast enough that i haven not timed it
so , i would highly recommend this to anyone who uses cf media with a laptop
it is the way to go ! .
this device was the second wind my old panasonic digital camera needed
i connect the camera to the laptop with a serial cable wich makes it to slow ( no usb cable ) , so i tried this inexpensive alternative in order to revive my old camera wich still works perfectly
i needed a way to download the pictures from the cf card to the computer
now , i can download in seconds what usually took hours .
this compact flash adapter work is great
all you do is snap you compact flash card into it and slap it into your slot and bam ! it is also much faster for me then hooking up my digital camera to the computer using a usb cord and ac/dc adapter ( saves on batteries )
faster in the hook up time and faster in downloading and uploading
i can highly recommend this product , i am very happy with it .
i use it with my ibm thinkpad to download pictures from a nikon coolpix <NUM> with a 512mb cf card
this adapter works great
plugged it in and winxp automatically recognized it as e drive
this adapter worked in win2000 and win98 as well
great price and buying it new is actually cheaper than used !
this is a fabulous device for transferring large volume of data from my handheld ( jornada 548 ) to my laptop , and .
this is a very high quality leather case with good hardware
my laptop fits well and it has a place for almost everything
the almost is a limited amount of space to carry the computer power supply and cords
there isn not a pocket deep enough to carry those items without causing the outside to bulge
the velcro flap fastners are noisey and overdone
a few snaps would have been much better
other than that the quality is first rate .
i bought this targus cln5 15
4 traditional leather case through amazon with data vision as the seller
why did i mention that ? because this case has recently undergone a "refresh" as they put it , which means they it
the newer version , which is what i received from data vision , has way more pockets and space than the much older original version
i contacted another large supplier and they in fact had the older version , and were charging more money
you will notice that it is selling for much more from all of the other suppliers
the new one is great
this model , unlike some of the competition is all leather on the outside
lesser models have leather faces on them , but then they have plastic sides
there is plenty of room for everything in here
i have a 15
4 inch laptop , and i can store the large section of the a/c adapter in the same section
they even have an adjustable dividing flap in that section so it does not touch your laptop
the remaining detachable plug in cord of the adapter goes in the compartmentalized section of the case with all of the other items , like wireless mouse , cable connector for myvantec lapcool <NUM> foldable notebook cooler with hub ( black ) which sits neatly under the laptop since folded up for transport it only takes up
9 inches of space
( 9/10ths of one inch ) so this case has ample room for my hp laptop as well as the
9 inch cooler sitting underneath
with the velcro secured tie down strap , nothing moves
there are more compartments on the other side as well
the pictures illustrating this case are a mish mosh of both series
the one i received from data vision , the newer "refresh" version as they call it , is the one you see in photo number 1 , the featured photo
if you notice the second picture and other pictures are a different case , the older version
you can easily see the difference because the older one has a long pad on the strap , and the new one has an oval , adjustable one
by visiting targus is website you can see photos of the new one in its completeness
i would upload those photos , but i think it is smart to leave the mix , since that is what some of the suppliers are selling
this case has a definite luxury about it
they have their top cases going for <NUM> times as much , but this one really fills the bill nicely ; it is executive material without going over the top
hey for <NUM> or <NUM> dollars less than the data vision price you can buy an all plastic one
overall this case is well designed , and comfortable
highly recommended .
product shipped fast and looks exactly as it did in the photo
would definitely purchase from this seller again .
i bought this bag for a 15
4'' laptop mbp , an extra battery , a spare hd , and some papers
not very much stuff
so i was extremely disappointed that a $ <NUM> leather bag that supposedly was of good quality had one of the straps completely rip off the body of the bag , where the strap was stitched in the side
this bag was used for <NUM> months before the strap ripped under normal , daily usage
there was nothing done to shorten the life of a bag such as this one .
there are better cases on the market , but i couldn not find one close to the price of this one
holds the pc snuggly , and there is lots of gadget space
great deal .
looks nice
only complaint is if moderately packed it is hard to close
good for the light traveler .
there is no way i cannot not like this bag - its leathery , its tough , it looks good and has a lot of space for a laptop and paperwork
and i never paid a dime for the <NUM> that i had
i get these for free back when i worked for ibm
we were moving out of a client site and moving our assets out of that client company
i have a stack of these things and was told to throw them away
i decided to keep them as they were near brand new , some still had the product inspector is card in it
i cleaned up the leather and conditioned them
i still have <NUM> left
i gave the rest away
wish i had known how much these sold for~ !
i got one of these before and they are really good
i was going to get one at staples but it was $32
i paid $10 less for the same product , that is a good deal to me .
when will amazon wise up and allow no stars for a rating ? this is so cheaply made it is worthless
the battery compartment is &<HASHTAG> ; held in place&<HASHTAG> ; by a tiny plastic bar
broke almost immediately on my unit making the thing totally useless ; with out the battery compartment locked in place it simply doesn not work
they might as well have made the cable out of a piece of string ! don not waste your money
like many other people here , my lock jammed
luckily , i didn not pay for it , my company did
worked for about <NUM> months and then just stopped working
i don not think it "magically" reset its own combination
mechanical locks don not do that
more likely the rotating mechanism that allows the lock to unlock got jammed
my it guy had to saw it off
did some damage to the cosmetics of my company laptop
simply put : don not use this product
great while it worked
imagine getting it jammed at a coffee house rather then your office or home
yikes .
i travel with my notebook in my backpack
i have had three of these things
you have to read the instructions to set the combination correctly ! they all have worked well and they never have changed the combination on me spontaneously ! the newer model has the same features but uses aaa bats and not a 9v which the old one used
it is thiner than the old model also
i like the blinking red light when ever i arm it
i run the cable through my zipper on my backpack and leave in strapped to the desk or chair in my hotel room
it creates a shrill loud alarm ( if you set it for this feature ) when the unit is moved
there are two sensitivities
you can set it to only alarm if the cable is cut
yes you can cut the cable with a good set of wire cutters
so it would not stop anyone determined to take your notebook from you and had strong intentions to do so
it will stop someone from just grabbing it and trying to run
i also really like the little gadget in the photo
( lower right hand corner of photo ) it fits into the security hole of my notebook very snugly
the cable of the defcon can go through the hole of this gadget and you can just lay it next to your notebook and it will start to "scream" as soon as the notebook is moved ( it does give you a ~15 second warning before "screaming" with a loud chirp sound , so you can disarm it
go to targus website and check it out
i don not work for them
i do believe they sell a quality little alarm
it is not fort knox , it is a lot better than nothing
blinking light and siren deters the common dumb criminal ( not on drugs or really crazy ) from taking your computer
it is should be just one of a series of methods you have to secure your notebook , not the only one
it is nice for travel
you can even hang the thing on a door knob and know if someone opens the door
it is a motion alarm with a blinking red light
the number of blinks tells you how it is armed
i recommend it .
this is not a review of the product but i thought this information may be good to know before you order
could save someone money and frustration
i ordered this defcon <NUM> unit ( ~$34 ) in april 2013 , and received a devcon cl ( combination lock and cable ~$21 ) that was improperly labled with an amazon sku label listed improperly as a defcon <NUM> unit
it arrived in a clear plastic pack so i could see it was the wrong item
if i did not have prime it would likely have cost me shipping
prime enabled me to return it and get a full refund , so i was ok with this
just fyi , if you are ordering this and paying for shipping
it looked like a good device and was recommended to lock down a ~$300 rv voltage protector that can be stolen easily while camping
but , rather than risk another mislabeled device from the same amazon seller , i opted to use something else
amazon may not charge shipping if one re orders when this happens , but you would probably lose it if you requested a refund
be aware this is the first time an amazon seller has done this to my knowledge in over <NUM> years of business with amazon ( i am very happy with amazon and appreciate their costomer service ) , so i just wanted to help if you pay for shipping
sorry this is not a review but i hope this helps someone .
great lock for the price
if you need a low cost lock to defend against amateur thieves than this is the lock for you .
i bought a defcon <NUM> pa 400u in 1998
it works perfectly x <NUM> years
it has no key , but works w a combination
i have just bought another for another computer .
i needed three of these for field employees
easy to a memorable code and attach to the laptop
i would recommend !
i am enraged right now at this godforsaken pos laptop "lock"
let me set the scene : i go into the library for a nice , long afternoon of studying
i don not feel comfortable leaving my laptop on the table whenever i go to the bathroom , so i bring this targus defcon cl along to secure my computer for whenever i am not at the table
i connect it and get on with my studying
come dinnertime , i feel it is time to go , so i put the combo in the lock and it won not unlock
i am getting frantic , thinking maybe i have gone insane and forgot the combo ( which would be impossible since it is the digits of my freaking date of birth )
desperate , i google "targus defcon cl won not open"
lo and behold , this exact same thing has happened to hundreds of other people ! the amazon reviews alone are almost all about how the combo will randomly change on you ! now i am trippin out , so i start googling a way to open the piece of crap up without the combo
luckily , engagdet
com did an article a few years ago about how easy it is to cut the cable or to decipher the combination of these things
i drive home to grab a strong set of wire cutters , and come back to cut the cable
takes me about <NUM> minutes to cut through , with a 7" wire cutter ( something a person can have in their pocket while you are away from your comp , spend <NUM> min , and be off with your laptop in their hands )
unfortunately , during that <NUM> min duration , someone reports me to the librarian because they think i am trying to steal a laptop
i have to log in to the computer to prove that it is mine
slightly embarrassing , but even he thought it was hilarious that the lock not only messed up my combo , but was pretty easy to cut through
so , to recap , the reasons this is the worst product i have ever purchased : 1 ) it will randomly change the combo
this has happened in more cases than not ( google it )
2 ) the cable literally takes minutes with a mediocre set of cutters to get through
anyone can take your laptop if you are off in the bathroom or something for a bit .
i bought <NUM> of these for my work so we can lock down our laptops while at the client site
the product is good , minus the fact you can only set the lock code once
i already had a coworker forget his code after <NUM> day , so we had to scrap that lock .
compares favorably with much more expensive cables
i actually don not use it for , but as a safety wire to secure a ceiling mounted video projector , but i am sure it works as a theft prevention devise as well
fit the defcon connector and the price was right .
for users that travels a lot <PERCENT> recomended most cases when you need leave your notebook in some conference room or room hotel .
i don not know why there are so many negative reviews , i bought the combo lock and the key lock and they both work great for me
i take them to starbucks all the time and no one touches my laptop
this is a great buy , worth your money
like this key lock , as i always had problems with the combination locks
the length of this is not too long , and i did not have problems with chemical smells that some people have mentioned
i noticed that the review section for this product had people reviewing the combination lock
i had the combination version the combination changed and i had to pry it off my computer .
if you follow the instructions ( that is why they are there ) this lock will work just fine , i have never had it "mysteriously" change combination on me
there are only two problems with this little lock , the first is , it tends to seize up on occasion , but it comes out after a few seconds ( not <NUM> minutes as mentioned by another reviewer )
also , this lock is fairly easy to change the combo , so if you have a roommate that hates you , or criminals that carry around screwdrivers , you may be in a bit of trouble
this is a mechanical lock , it does not have a "mind o it is own
this device has a major design flaw and does not prevent thieves from cutting it up
i used this poorly designed lock on my macbook pro and the thief was still able to destroy the lock with a cutter
mind you , the lock portion was destroyed , not the cable
the thief was able to yank out enough of a crease located between my laptop hole and the combo lock itself for his metal cutter to easily break its clippers
basically this device provides a false sense of security when contends to a thief with metal cutter .
i now have three of these and have to highly recommend this item
i use it for my computer as well as for my tv center .
i bought this product veeeery long time ago and never used till <NUM> moths ago
i bought in <NUM> and i used on september 2012
for first time because i needed
i had a very % dollars cheap ruler extension same like this but cheap
i needed this for split the power overloading on my other extension , because the other one when overloaded pops up the switch and turns off , so i split the power and it was everything ok , and then this surge arrest protector starts burning inside and smelling to burnt plastic
me and my roomate saw it and yes , the power cable was hot as hell as it might be on for hours at full capacity and then the inside of the surge arrest start somking so we unpluged , and if it wasnt because of the fact we were there and realized this happen , what if we just leave and leave this protector running , i am sure we might found a big fire when we might come back
in other words i had to put this in trash because it has no such a protection , my <NUM> dollar protector "extension" workd better than this pice of s* because that one when it is over loaded automatically pops up the power button and turns off but dont got burnt
be carefull pelase and save money
just keep an eye on this , if you use normally might work fine but if you kind of overload with too much electric devices all of them runing this will not protect instead this will burn your house try by yourself if not beleive it
if this might be a trully protector might turn it off automatically when overload but this keeps running till gots on fire .
i used my surgearrest protector to protect my home office equipment
one day , "poof" went my computer during a quick power outage
the incoming power surge when the power came back on was too much for apc to handle
sent my unit in for eval , as they request
they said that since there was no evidence of a failure of their product , they would not compensate me for my power supply and motherboard being fried
are they too dense to understand that if their product fails to stop a surge , it may be a case of the movs not blowing ? movs are designed to take the hit and suffer the damage , protecting your electronics from the surge
their device failed to stop a surge , failing to protect my equipment ! my advice - if your equipment and data are valuable to you , then purchase one of the "" surge protectors ( apc does not make these )
as they say , you get what you pay for
except with apc , who fail to honor their warranties
for those who insist on using cheap surge protectors , i hope you protect your vehicles with a good set of deer whistles
same sales principle - make them cheap enough for everyone , spin a marketing campaign stating they do the job , then rake in the profits while benefiting from consumers who will either not report a failure , or who will whimper quietly off into the sunset without complaining or sharing their experiences with the worthless product
if apc sold deer whistles , and a deer hits your car , they would avoid fulfilling their warranty because the whistles are not defective
the product may not have failed mechanically or electronically , but it certainly failed to provide protection
pay up , apc !
i purchase this item in amazon
which i purchase a lot of things in amazon
this item arrive on time , it is so nice and convenient to have at home or if you are travelling to take it with you in order to charge all the things that we have now days that have to be charge
it is just like the description say
easy to set up you can put on the wall if you like ? or on the floor
i am living for overseas and it is going to be very convenient item to have
luz m brown
the point of purchasing the apc surge protector was to increase the safety for my equipment and home
now the company has recalled their "older" products ( ours was purchased in march 2010 ) due to potential fires during very unusual conditions
instead of more safety , we had less
this is unacceptable for this type of product and causes concern about my other apc surge protector that i purchased later but was not in the recall
does the later product not have the same problem or has it not been out long enough for customers to report problems ? i chose to avoid the possible risk and to replace it with a different brand
also unacceptable is the only recourse for the consumer is to apply for a newer model
a better company would have offered a full refund option
needless to say , i will not be purchasing any more apc products .
this surge protector works well and provides lots of outlets , more than i actually need for my equipment
it does the job .
apc ( which by the way is american power conversion , not "american power conservation" as amazon
com currently shows it ) has always been serious about clean power
this is no ordinary surge protector
it has more protection features and absorbs more joules of surge energy than you are ever likely to see
but what i like is the intelligent layout of the outlets
with my adsl modem , i now have three huge "wall warts" to deal with
the pro8t2 handles them well , and manages another smaller one in the top tier of outlets
a large green light lets me know it is working
and the switch guard is removable -- if you want to be able to turn this unit on and off with your toe , apc made that possible , and they call out the feature in the instructions
you can spend $20 for a much less capable power station , or a few bucks more for one that will take care of your stuff
apc delivers the latter with this unit .
there are other power surge protectors cheaper and smaller
after my belkin protector broke after a direct lightning hit on my house , i purchased this item
the equipment i had plugged into the belkin model did not survive the direct hit
the other model of apc i had did protect my imac
i will never pruchase another belkin again
belkin is cheaper , but you get what you pay for
apc are built better , feel more solid , then the cheap plastic belkin protectors are .
fits great under a small desk and plug is flat against the outlet saving more room
on off switch in front also easily accessable
fills need for smaller footprint surge arrest .
i have had my spiii for about two years now , during which the pricing has come down some and the package offerings have increased , so this review may not match the exact contents amazon offers here
my unit came with a 32mb memory cartidge , the serial port connection cord , the usb programmer cord , the 12v power cord for the cigarette lighter , the &quot ; sticky&quot ; dash mount , and a mapsource cd with codes to unlock one region ( the us and canada consisted of regions , iirc )
i have since bought the beanbag dash mount and a 128mb card and purchased the &quot ; unlock all regions&quot ; option for city navigator--probably already included items for a new purchase in today is package
additionally , i downloaded the &quot ; british&quot ; voice package from garmin is website to replace the default &quot ; american&quot ; voice--the british lady is voice seems less harsh and less like a drill sergeant when giving directions ! i love this unit because it makes navigation so easy--isn not that the idea behind a gpsr ? with the citynav map information loaded into the memory card ( and with 128mb it fits all of pa , de , md , and d
and good chunks of wv , oh , ny , and nj ) i am able to get directions to nearly any street address
if you ask it to route you to a given destination , the unit actually tells you when a turn is coming up , e
&quot ; in point two miles exit right , &quot ; or &quot ; in <NUM> feet turn left
&quot ; if you are driving without a destination selected , the unit will display the cross streets by name as you approach
you can zoom the map in for street detail or zoom out to see more of the countryside
if you have a destination selected , the unit will zoom in automatically as you approach and zoom in even more for a detailed overview of approaching intersections as you near a turn
if you are in an area for which you do not have the mapsource detail loaded , the unit still has an internal base map that contains cities , highways , interstates , and major bodies of water , so it can still route you from city to city using the major roads
this makes driving long distances feasible and you can load up the memory card with the areas you expect to spend most of your time in if you don not have enough memory for the entire route
however , in those areas for which you do have the map detail loaded you can get directions to an address or even select various destinations ( restaurants , attractions , banks , shopping centers , etc
) listed by name and/or distance
the unit also displays address and phone information for those destinations , which is useful to call ahead and make reservations or check for vacancy if you are the spontaneous weekend tourist like i am
the display is beautiful--major routes are in red , arterials in thick black , minor streets in thin black , rivers and lakes in blue , parks and golf courses in green , and the background will change at sunset or sunrise to yellow ( daylight ) or black ( night ) as appropriate ( the black streets will also switch to white at night )
please note that the map detail , which includes streets and popular destinations , is a feature of the map software , not the unit itself
garmin seems to issue updated map software on an annual basis , but you must pay for those updates
i am still using citynav 4
1 , although garmin is website states that 6
0 is coming out this summer
the new 6
0 software will probably contain more business listings and reflect more recent road construction , but i am doing fine with 4
1 and don not see a need yet to pay for the upgrade
one reviewer complained about the lack of starbucks locations with his map , and i expect garmin will be adding more and more types of businesses like that as time goes by
enough babbling--in summary , here are some pros of this unit : o cheaper than most gps systemso portable , so you can share the unit with your &quot ; fleet&quot ; or take it along in a rental car ( and you'd best hide it or take it with you when parking so it doesn not get stolen ) o voice navigation , so you can anticipate an upcoming turn without having to take your eyes off the roado color display--so much better than a gray scale map ! o accurate and helpful when driving somewhere unfamiliaro automatic route recalculation if you miss a turn or have to detouro address and phone info for listed businesses/sites so you can call aheadand the cons i have experienced : o voice navigation could be somewhat improved for confusing intersections--do i take a right or sharp right at this ? o eats batteries--but this unit is too bulky to walk around with , so there is no reason it should ever be used without being plugged into your cigarette lighter
o awkward interface--entering street names or address numbers is awkward with the rocker buttono loses signal in areas with tall buildings--usually when you are downtown and *really* need directions the most , unfortunately ! however , this is a problem with all gps receivers and due more to the nature of the gps system than the unit itself
all in all , i love my spiii
it has all the features i really need
there are units out there that are newer , have more features , and may be easier to use , but they are also more expensive
as long as garmin keeps releasing updated map software compatible with the spiii , this unit should serve my needs for many more years .
i just replaced the garmin gps iii+ , which i had in my truck , with the colormap
the screen is much easier to see in a variety of lighting conditions
the colormap also changes some of the field colors , depending on the time of day , to provide ever greater visibility
this unit is really designed to be used in a vehicle and provides features to that effect such as a readout stating which road your currently on
this is much easier than trying to find the road label while you are driving along
the rom maps cover most major areas of the us , but for true coolness you need a memory cartridge and a copy of the metroguide cd rom
the areas in this software are huge so i suggest going with the <NUM> meg cart and skipping the <NUM> meg one
for example , northern virginia takes about <NUM> meg and the dc metro area is another <NUM> meg
anyone living in either area probably wants both regions available so you can see that the <NUM> meg cartridge is key
all in all , a very cool toy .
i bought my sp3 when i moved to the washington dc area , and have to say it works great
i am never lost and it can find nearly everything
there are a few streets that have no numbers in arlington , but otherwise it is pretty good
i have also used the sp when traveling to other areas
the one issue that i have is that it has a hard time keeping a good signal in the city because of all the buildings
dc is not too bad , but i have had bigger problems in places like nyc and toronto with the tall skyscrapers
if it is plotting a course for you , you might miss a turn because it loses the signal for a few seconds
to make things worse , since there is such a grid in the cities , it often takes a while to recalculate the course , by which point you might be lost again
i find times when i need to pull off and wait for the gps to catch up
i would highly recommend it if you travel a lot , or are unfamiliar with an area , just be careful if you are using it for large cities .
first i want to say i am very happy with the talking spiii
it is does a pretty good job routing and if you drive off the route it will autorecalc a new route for you
i have used numerous gps is in the past and this does a great job for driving ( for biking or hiking i highly recommend the garmin <NUM> map , my favorite gps )
now there are some things to know about this product however
first you get a cd that allows you to download maps from your pc to your steetpilot
it works over either serial or usb ( usb goes to a 32mb memory card that you can plug in )
the cd contains maps of the us but
you only get to select one region of the us for free
the rest of them you must pay for from garmin for approx $116 a shot ( $291 total for the total us )
you can purchase this online at garmin is web site and they will give you a key to open up the different regions
the base map
the one built into the garmin , on the gps is still &quot ; good&quot ; for the whole us but the cd give much better detail
i am not complaining about this since the maps seem pretty up to date
the road i live on is <NUM> years old and no other mapping software to my knowledge has it as part of their data but the garmin software did
another thing to note is the form factor for the streetpilot iii and the older street pilots are different
this can be important if you order from garmin direct accessories like the bean bag mount ( as i found out ) .
please allow me to preface this review with the fact that i have absolutely no sense of direction
for those with excellent sense of direction , this may seem like an extravagant purchase until they come down in cost
i had to travel to california recently ( i only lived there my whole life before 1999 ) , but since i had never driven in california before , i was quite nervous about doing so
the rental car had a gps very similar to the street pilot , and using that gave me a great sense of confidence in driving around
shortly after my return i realized how badly we needed a gps in our car
the street pilot was the best option for us because it has all the features of a auto gps , but the added convenience of being portable- now when i head out of town i can take the street pilot rather than having to rent a car with a gps
not to mention the street pilot is about 1/2 to 1/3 of the cost of a system
some of the other reviewers have complained about how long it takes the street pilot to recalculate a route once the vehicle has gone
i have intentionally gone several times just to see how it performs , and i have been very pleased
it does take a few seconds , but from my experience it did not take so long that i got any further than i already was
a feature that i found to be very helpful in the street pilot which was not in the rental car is gps is a search by company name
if you are looking for a department store , but you can not remember its address , just search by the name , and the street pilot will navigate you to the closest one
if you are looking for that great chinese restaurant a couple of miles away , but you can not remember the name , you can search for chinese restaurants in your area and find the correct one based on its address
want to order ahead , or put your name on the seating list ? once the street pilot finds the restaurant you are looking for , it displays their phone number on the monitor as well
about the only two complaints i have about the street pilot are very trivial
on the rental car i used , the gps would automatically lower the volume on the stereo when the gps needed to announce an instruction
being an external unit , the street pilot does not have this luxury
since i tend to listen to music , well , at volume while driving , it does take a little getting used to lowering the volume when using the street pilot around town , but again , this is a very minor complaint given all of the positive features the street pilot has
my other complaint is that occasionally it does give directions which are not the most direct route
i used this on a trial basis in areas i was familiar with just to see how it performs , and i did find myself thinking on occasion "why is it telling me to go this way , when that way is much more direct ? " especially since i live within a half an hour of garmin is world headquarters , it would seem to me that they would at least know the most direct routes around here ! but even at this , the street pilot does get you to the correct destination every time , even if it sometimes takes an indirect route
i noticed that the package includes both a beanbag mount and a permanent dashboard mount for the street pilot
since street pilots have a way of being swiped , my suggestion would be to always use the beanbag mount , since a permanent mount could cause thieves to break into the car to find the gps that is no longer in the car
i drive a new jetta , and i did not want to get sticky stuff all over my dashboard , so i chose to try out the beanbag
it does not slip , even when making sharp turns
i suppose if i were in a collision this would not be the case , but in normal driving , the beanbag is great
of course , as others have advised , do not leave your street pilot in the car unattended for any reason
but given the fact that you are going to be spending around $1g for this puppy you probably already knew that
and one other safety feature that i think is great , but others might be annoyed by it : once you are driving , you cannot change the destination ; it goes into a secure mode
to change the address , you need to stop the car
this may be a nuisance to some , but given how badly people drive while talking on cell phones , it is probably best that garmin tries to curb people from pressing all sorts of buttons on their gps while zipping down the road at <NUM> mph .
how much would you spend to protect your $
palm ? this case looks real good , and it fits your palm like a glove , adds very little additional weight and gives you the mental peace that your palm will be protected from about everything it could happen to it
leather may look more stylish , but they are also bulky
a great buy .
i too thought this case was a bit on the flimsy side , given its plastic + metal covering construction
however , my palm vx has survived more than its share of bumps and drops with aplomb , and it is because of this case
it opens easily , closes easily , and still fits in my pocket comfortably
i am confident the palm is screen is protected with this case
it is given great service for over a year now .
the hard case is stylish , compact , and a good protector of my investment
one reviewer wrote that it is difficult to charge the palm with the case on
it really isn not a problem at all if you place the charger on the edge of your desk so that hard case can extend off
i don not worry about it falling over since the charge is so sturdy
i love the case because it provides such great protection in a stylish manner
enjoy !
very nice
my palm vx fits in it & is protected
it is also shiny
this case has worked great for me ! it protects your palm v from falls , spills , and related &quot ; accidents&quot ; i also like the look of the case a lot
it blends well with the design of the palm v
the only &quot ; cons&quot ; i could find to this case is that it will add weight and size to your palm
nonetheless , it is well worth the protection you get ( plus , this will fix the problem the palm v has with its regular cover of turning itself on )
sure , you will have to pull the palm v out of the case to hotsync , but that will only take <NUM> secs
i love my hard case , and it has certainly lived up to its job of protecting my palm .
this is the perfect example of excellent marketing pushing an inferior product to market
the consumer is fooled into thinking that this &quot ; hard case&quot ; is actually hard and is actually made of alumunim , when in fact the case is made of plastic and has two very thin strips of aluminum outside the plastic
this case could easily crack under little pressure
i purchased this case but was greatly disappointed by the plastic composition and flimsiness of the case
for <NUM> bucks you think you'd get something nice and strong , but save your money for some other case
if you want just something to protect your palm v in , i'd strongly suggest something with a leather cover that is far more durable than this plastic case
even better , go for the leather case that has a zipper
for even more protection , go for the rhinoskin palm protectors
those are a little bit more expensive but are definitely worth the money , considering the amount of money it costs to replace your palm if you damage it
the only reason why you should buy this flimsy , overpriced &quot ; hard case&quot ; is if you have a lot of money to blow , care more about looks than functionality , and don not care if your palm actually gets damaged
this case will pop open when you don not expect it , and who knows what will happen to your palm is panel .
after recently purchasing a new palm vx , i thought it would be a good idea to invest in a better form of protection than the included leatherette flap
the palm v hard case is about the only sleek option that there is at the moment
the case attaches to the palm v via the left stylus storage area
a stylus shaped piece attaches the palm to the hinge in the case
the case itself opens like a book and allows the palm to move much like a page in the book
located behind the palm on the inside of the case is an area to store a business card or other small piece of paper
the case comes together nicely and has a cut out for the ir port as well as the right stylus
pros : 1 ) protects as advertised
the point of a hard case should be adequate protection first of all , and this case delivers as advertised
the aluminum reinforced plastic shell hugs the palm v tightly and securely
2 ) allows for ir port usage while resting in case
3 ) case does not allow for you to accidentally turn the unit on while in your pocketcons : 1 ) heavy : one of the selling points for the palm v series is the sleek , lightweight design
while this case may not seem like too much additional weight , the combination of the palm v in the case is noticeably heavier
in fact my wife is palm iii and my palm v weigh about the same now
2 ) obstructive : hot sync is really only accomplished by taking the unit out of the case due to the girth of the case itself
a friend of mine who has a keyboard tried to rest the unit on the keyboard and found the case too cumbersome for this purpose as well
3 ) hand holding the unit is more difficult
with the included leather flap , you are able to fold it behind the unit to easily hold the palm in one hand
the hard case does not fold back on itself , which means there is a much larger surface area to support while using the palm
this is especially annoying for me since i use my palm frequently while standing or walking here and there
4 )
overall , i think the hard case is best suited for someone who is looking to provide the best protection for his or her palm in the smallest package
you will have to decide if the increased weight and obtrusiveness of the case is worth the added protection it offers
at this time , i am still using the case , but i anticipate going back to the default leather flap in the future when i grow tired of the cons listed above
thanks for your time .
i was skeptical of the palm hardcase at first
afterall , it is just a piece of plastic with some aluminum sheeting on it
i no longer have doubts
i have unintentionally dropped my palm from considerable heights on a variety of surfaces ( brick , hard wood floor , etc
) , and both the case and , more importantly , the palm itself have come out completely unscathed
so , my advice is , if you are looking for real protection for your investment , just get one of these
there is no need to spend more on a titanium box from rhino skin or any of the others ( unless you are planning on using the palm for mountain climbing or on the shooting range
not surprisingly , the engineers over at palm really did a fantastic job making this case stylish , too
you don not feel geeky pulling it out , and the brushed aluminum goes very well with the palm itself
an excellent product .
i was going to buy one of these cases for my new palm vx
it looked great and i figured if it was made by palm that it would be a good buy to keep my new toy
i mean tool
fortunately , i saw one in a store before i ordered one
as some of the other reviews have said , it is made out of cheap plastic with a thin sheet of metal on the front for decoration
the hingers are fragile and the is weak
i don not think it is worth the cost and i have seen them as low as $25
if you are buying a hardcase , i am assuming you want some protection for your palm
this won not give it to you
if you just want something that looks good to , there are lots of nice leather ones out there
as for me , i decided to spend the extra money on a rhinoskin molded aluminum case
i will let you know how that goes
so far , so good
check them out .
this is the best palm v case going
actually almost the best
palm just released a metallic blue special edition hard case that i like a little better , but this case is great
while the plastic was a bit of a , at least the brushed stainless steel makes the case a bit more attractive and looks pretty sleek much like the palm v itself
i imagine that is part of the reason you bought the v instead of the iii or the vii
the case does not close quite as tight as i would like , but if you mess with centering the hinge it closes
it provides the best protection of the cases i have tried and does not make the palm so bulky that you can not stand to take it everywhere you go
i would recommend this or the new blue case to anyone who likes the sleek modern look and wants to protect their investment and their data .
this is a great item
i tried three different isoft' cases and always had a problem with the palm coming on and beeping while it was in my pocket
give this baby five stars ! the critism is wrong
can not use left handed ? sure you can
just put it in the left side ! b
can not synch while in the case ? you bet you can
just tilt the stand to the side
no problem .
i initially bought the special edition one but since i loved that so much i went out and bought the silver one as well
now i rotate my cases
the only difference of the silver case and the blue special edition case other than color is the logo in the front
the blue one has the circular palm logo while the silver one has the dotted "p" logo of palm , like the one that you see whenever you reset the unit
i first bought the slim leather case for my vx and after i used it for about <NUM> months , i became quite dissatified with it
one of the reasons why i was not happy with the slim case was because it made the whole vx a lot bigger then it really is
also after a few months the leather case had a few noticable scratches
it also began to warp
i decided to find an alternative
after much thought i decided to get the hard case for the vx
at first i was discouraged that i had to remove the case every time i hotsynced
however after heeding the suggestions of many others i found that proping it up on a book or a bunch of cd cases actually works well
i dont think there is any other case that allows you to sync that easy without removing the case
in that aspect i dont think there is a better case
however i discover that you have to insert the unit properly for the case to open and stay closed right
if you dont push the case far enough into the silo it really wont work right
if you insert the unit properly it opens and closes brilliantly
the spring loaded feature of the case is probably its best feature
when opening and closing the case it is very noticable that there is more tension opening the case then there is closing
in that aspect there is really no other case out there at offers that
one thing that i disliked about the slim leather case was that often times the buttons were accidentally pressed
whether it was the application buttons or the power button , it often got pressed even with the leather case firmly closed
that was not the case for the hard case
although the contrast button was pressed occationally pressed , its extremely rare
also with the hard case firmly shut , the unit is allowed to move a little , just enough to allow some impact to be absorbed when you accidentally bump or drop it
finally and more importantly the case is one of very few that actually protects the unit , looks good and maintains the shape and sleekness of the vx
it adds virtually nothing to the overall size of the vx
its beautiful
i just hope that it will fit the m505 when i go get that ! : - )
i am a computer consultant , which means i use my palmpilot all the time
i had a palm iii , but it died from the abuse of travelling in my back pocket
i switched to the palm v series for its solid construction and rechargable battery
i searched for a case that would protect the device from daily wear and tear and chose the palm v hard case for this reason
it protects the screen with its clamshell closure and does not add bulk to the package
even with the case , it is still smaller than a palm iii
you have to keep your cradle near the edge of your desk if you want to hotsync while still inside the case
i had to add small adhesive pads to protect the metallic finish
other than that , it is perfect ! when i beat up the case too much , i will just buy another one
my palm v still looks brand new !
i will admit it , i bought the case ( the metallic blue one too ! ) just because it was sexy
it does a good job protecting my palm vx , but the case doesn not seem sturdy
there also seems to be a problem where the contrast button at the top of the palm pilot gets pressed by the case , this can be fixed by sliding the palm just a hair
overall , this case rocks , very glad i got it , the metallic blue one is better though , i get many compliments and good looks from it
buy it !
when i saw pictures of this , i expected this to be a substantial case
since it is called a hard case , i expected it , well , to be hard
but it is not
it is plastic with a thin metal cover on the front and back that look more like they are there for fashion than funciton
the metal sides will give if you try to bend it
also , i think the closing mechanism is terrible
you have to get the palm in there just right for it to close completely and even then , it is not a tight seal
and usually when it is put in this way , the top of the case will hit the contrast button and you will have to keep fixing it so you can view the screen
it does not snap together , which annoys me
while the case itself may not stay shut , the palm *is* securely held in the case , which is one good thing about this case
it has a holder similair to the stylus , so you just slide it in one of your stylus slots
i prefer this way of attaching the palm , rather than some other cases which use velcro
i am not going to trust velcro with something that is as expensive as a palm
i totally don not think it is worth the money , but at the same time , having good protection for your palm is an absolute necessity , so i actually do recommend that you get this product
my palm has taken several tumbles and it is no worse for the wear
i have had my palm and case for about two weeks now , and there is already quite a few scratches on the metal casing
so it does protect it
but if you are expecting this case to be really nicely made and substantial , guess again
it will however offer some protection to your pda
i think palm could and should be making a better product
our palms cost us a bundle and we want to protect them
it is almost like the people at palm want our pda is to break so they can sell us more
i don not see why there is so much emphasis on making the cases as small as possible
i'd rather see a slightly bulkier , yet streamlined case that not only securely held the palm , but had about a quarter inch of foam padding on the inside to protect the unit from damage , and then a true metal casing on the outside
even with some extra padding and bulk , the case would still be tiny .
i did a previous review on this case , which i liked , and just wanted to clear up a misconception i read by another reviewer
he said the case doesn not offer that much protection because it is just plastic with an aluminum finish
the case has real aluminum bonded to plastic , because one of the occasional problems i have heard about with this case is that the aluminum will sometimes delaminate and separate from the plastic
aside from the occasional problem like that , i found this to be quality case
although it seems little pricey when you first purchase it , it is worth it as it costs $100 to get the glass screen replaced by palm if it breaks .
i tried the chintzy cover that came with the palm v , but it does not offer enough protection
then i tried the &quot ; slim&quot ; leather case from 3com , and it is ok , but bulky , and the strap that closes it is inconvenient
finally managed to find the hard case at compusa , and like it the best
ok , it is not perfect
you do have to remove the v or put it on a book in order to hotsync , but so what ? for my money , the hard case is the way to go .
the palm hard case will keep your palm v protected , without adding much to it is size or weight
since i have the slim leather case , and tried the rhinoskin case , i will try to address some of the complaints others have posted
it is only plastic -- true , but the outer metal shield adds quite a bit of protection
the spring is weak -- part of the problem with using the palm v hard case is installing your palm
if the rail is not centered in the stylus holder , either the front or the back of the case will not close properly , giving the impression that the springs are weak
true , they could be stronger , but if you use your palm a lot you want it to open easily
there is a line and a flat side on the rail to help you center it
it may take a few tries , but keep at it
you have to remove your palm to use the hotsync cradle -- not true
just move the cradle to the edge of the table or desk and let the case hang over the edge
just be careful you don not knock it off the desk accidently
others have suggested placing a book under the cradle
either works fine
let is face it
you bought your palm v because of it is size , and you probably use it a lot
if so , this is your best option when it comes to cases
pretty good protection , easy to carry ( very slim and trim ) , and easy to open and close
this case also solves the problem of your palm turning itself on accidently , a problem with the leather cases and covers , although the leather cases are far more elegant and sumptuous
also , because this case does not press on the scroll button , if you forget to turn off your palm , and close the case , your palm will will turn itself off and not run down the battery
the rhinoskin case does offer better protection , however i did not feel it was worth the money ( see my review ) .
why spend an extra hundred dollars to get the palm vx , which is half the size of palm iii , and then add a case which makes it about the same size as the palm iii again
this unit looks very protective because of the aluminum finish
however , it is only hardened plastic
not a great shock protector
in addition , i had trouble getting the catch to stay closed
i got this as a gift , tried it and do not use it because it adds too much additional bulk .
this one is a good extra investment if you are buying a palm v
the little leather flap that comes with the palm is really not adequate to protect your machine
this hard case is tough enough to withstand serious blows
it looks elegant and it is not too big - the palm will still fit in your shirt pocket when in the case
i recommend getting this one - you need to get something to protect from scratching anyway , and this case protects from much much more .
i purchased these rechargeable batteries for my daughter and myself
in the description it said twin pack aa batteries
so i ordered <NUM> packs and was billed for <NUM> pack shipping
but when i received the batteries , it was a for pack
so if i only received <NUM> pack of <NUM> batteries instead of a <NUM> twin pack of batteries
why was i billed for <NUM> twin packs instead of just paying for <NUM> 4 pack
very confusing .
these batteries are exactly what i expected ( <MENTION>
3 volts ) and work well for any electronic device i put these in i plan on buying even more in the future this is a great buy
i fully charged them , put them in my digital camera , and immediately got the &<HASHTAG> ; low battery&<HASHTAG> ; signal
not made is us
i do not recommend them .
bought these batteries to use with the kodak battery charger ( which ships with <NUM> aa batteries
) plan was to use them for my digital camera
they work , but unlike the batteries that ship with the kodak ( which are <NUM> ) , these batteries are rated at only <NUM> mah
mah means hours and is a measure of the amount of power the battery can store and deliver before needing to be recharged
so , they deliver only <PERCENT> of the life of the batteries
my digital cam responds to this with a indicator , even when all <NUM> batteries are at full charge .
really good deal for only <NUM> dollars
they came very quick and work like there supposed to
i got what i pad for and have no regrets .
why case logic discontinued these i will never know
back in my dvd collecting days there were my chosen medium of storage and protection .
i love these cases , and have a few of them , and will get more
no real complaints with them - sure reduced the amount of shelf space my dvds required , and allows me to organize by genre
the sleeves are held in a binder , so they can be pulled out and , too , so if you like to keep your dvds alphabetically , you can pop a new cd into the stream without having to move every dvd like one would have to with the stupid other caselogic cases that don not have removable pages
the material is strong adn well made
i very much like the leather look and feel of the case , and they look sharp on the shelf
the zippers are strong and well formed , the rivets are good , the binder material is sturdy
these babies will last for a good long time
my only complaint with this case - and also the <NUM> dvd holder from caselogic - is that they really don not hold that many without bulging or overpacking
i figure the <NUM> dvd holder averages about <NUM> discs , and the <NUM> holder gets <NUM> or 9
figure it this way - i have <NUM> of these holders
one holder when i bought it was missing <NUM> sleeves
but even though i started <NUM> sleeves less i should have , it doesn not matter , becuase after filling all the holders to their capacity , i have about <NUM> sleeves left over that i can not use , becuase the case holders aren not big enough to hold as many dvds as they say
the other caveat is that they have no place in which to put a label to let you know what is inside them
i thought of putting stickers onthem , but realized that open and closing them would eventually force the stickers to come undone , and look ugly
so what i did , and i recommend this to you , is to make small cardstock labels with the contents of the case ( i sort mine by genre , so mine say "action" or "science fiction" , and each genre has it is own color scheme , etc
i did not put the movie names on the labels , cuz one never knows when one will need to move a movie to another case to make room for another , eh ? ) , and then tied some string to them and put the string through the hole in the zipper handle
this system works wonderfully , and if you make really nice cards for them , they look good , too
for those two reasons , i only give these <NUM> stars
those caveats aside , these are wonderful - the sleeves have room to put the front page or other amterials from the dvd , space for the disc itself ( they can even fit <NUM> dvds in them , for those double dvd sets like star wars )
they reduced my shelving needs by about <PERCENT> , and for that , it is worth the cost ,
and it is way easier to carry <NUM> dvds in one package , then <NUM> plastic dvd containers
buy these , get your life in order , and open some space in your house .
i am so dissappointed in caselogic for discontinuing the hard cases
they were great , a hard cover with rubberized coating and actual cd case style holders inside ( that you pop out with your finger by pressing the center )
somebody could have sat on it and it would have been fine .
if you have a lot of dvds or cds these wallets are the way to go
i have over <NUM> cds and they were eating up my space
after getting rid of all the jewel cases i can store all of my cds and dvds on one book shelf
and since i organized them by theme , it is easy to find what i am looking for
by the way : you can mark the outside of the wallets with a pen
it makes it easy to know what is inside each wallet
for the dvd wallet you will need to do a little trimming for some of the liner notes
but it is easy to do
trust me
once you start using these wallets , you will love 'em
for what you get with these wallets i find the price fair
even better here on amazon
com enjoy
caselogic has set the standard for media storage , and this continues the tradition
a few tweaks are needed , however
i am certain that i will soon fill the <NUM> slots
therefore , it would be helpful to have a clear plastic sleeve on the spine for inserting a title or index to avoid having to open each case in search of a specific disk
the graphics sleeves are small enough that considerable trimming of the original case graphics is needed
actually , i would prefer that the dvd companies would make their graphics more easily adaptable to the album rather than the other way around .
it is not foolproof but makes a good inexpensive deterrent
it makes it harder for anyone to just grab and go
i hooked this up to a mac mini and a monitor .
definitely worthwhile for equipment one wants to keep
i teach at an urban high school
it is amazing what some students will take
ever since a student took my projector when i had a sub so i could attend a meeting , i lock as much down as possible
interesting that the school district does not bother with locks .
i chose this because i had a monitor without a lock slot
it was almost impossible to find a lock with its own plates ! this comes with <NUM> plastic discs and a tube of superglue
good points : thick cable , discs stick well
bad points : cable only works with discs ( not lock slots ) or holes it can pass through
i don not want to stick a disc to my computer , so i am using my old lock for it .
i have been using this for a while to secure a monitor and two external hard drives
one of the hard drives died and i wanted to secure its replacement , so ordered another set
while waiting i wondered if i could get the plastic anchor off and it
i set it on a table , placed a putty knife at the joint , and with one feeble blow popped it off
now i don not feel as secure
the epoxy that came with the set worked fine , but didn not bond to the hard drive is plastic case as strongly as i would have expected .
hopefully , i never have to find out whether these are affective or not , so i can only comment on the concept
you can either tie two things to a stable , heavy object such as a big desk , or you can tie three pieces of hardware together ( such as in the picture ) and make it a pain in the behind for someone to take all three at once and walk out your door
of course , none of that matters if the person knows you have the cable and brings a snazzy pair of bolt cutters
i haven not seen a product like this before , so i was thrilled to install it ( it took <NUM> minutes ) ; it is a better deterrent than the more popular kensington slot locks but will leave a gray lock on whatever you put it on , so choose wisely
in the end , as with most inexpensive security devices , it is really about the piece of mind , rather than the effectiveness of the product
if you want more , you can dish out some extra green and get you one of them "mi2" laser systems
cool .
excellent lock ! kensington builds good stuff
kensington desktop microsaver universal computer key lock and cable security system ( 64162 ) i ordered thru antonline though , and i was delivered an "open box" which was missng some parts
i ended up going thru the complete dispute procedure to resolve the issue
antonline did not respond
amazon refunded my money - nice job !
this will help give you a sense of security
i know from personal experience that you will have to take a hammer and chisel to these discs if you want them off
wrap them around the desk and you are good
easy and quick to install , smart design of the discs and the wire , just don not lose the key : )
excellent ! just what i needed to secure a 32inch flatscreen tv
of course it hasn not been put to the acid test yet , but install was easy enough and it seems solid enough .
the parts that glue to the hardware are quite small compared to other brands
it really just takes a few minutes to install and then your hardware is secure from the evildoers who want to steal your ram .
this product came as described and worked perfectly
i consider all factors when ordering , including quality , price and company reputation
this product passed all
i can recommend this to others
while it is not by any means foolproof i do feel better
the install was a breeze .
just what i needed to protect my valuable stuff that i can not take with me
the security cable kits i bought didn not have good glue pads on the anchors , so i ordered more anchors and used the instead , with much better results .
anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security , well designed and thought out
delivered on schedule , with usual good service .
this is exactly as i expected and as described
simple to install
sturdy &<HASHTAG> ; module&<HASHTAG> ; attachment via included super glue
cable is long enough for three items
i ran mine through a large in the wall to keep the systems from going anyplace
i suppose this item might deserve - but , by necessity and function , it is not every attractive
not really kensington is fault on that
but something ingenious would earn a 5th star : )
i share a house and always wonder if something might happen
these add extra security
locks are meant to keep honest people honest
of course any really determined thief will get them off but at least these will slow them down and maybe make them look for any easier target .
have a small home safe for documents and cash at home
wanted to create a deterrent to someone walking off with it
the outside of the small safe is plastic and the adhesive worked great on the case
i now secure it to a fixed object and have some level of security
not many solutions out there for securing file safes to fixed object , that i could find
great value , does the job .
great for securing computer equipment
currently i purchased this to use in a hospital and was exactly what i was looking for .
this is surprisingly the best power strip i ever had ! i love it for many reasons , it is compact form , the color code system , i can fit all the chargers in without conflicting with each other !
this has a long cord ( 16' ) so we were able to make a charging area for <NUM> devices ( and their respective adapters of all shapes and sizes ) quite far from the outlet
the product also looks nice enough to have out in plain sight .
pros : * heavy enough to stay where you put it
* cord long enough to be useful
* more aesthetically pleasing than the long beige strips
cons : * octopus style wiring does not support most cord organization strategies
* pricey .
this is the only one of my many surge protectors that has a <NUM> foot cord and i find that to be so useful
i have had it for over a year and it is my favorite not only because of the cord length but also the compact size which is nicely balanced and able to easily accommodate six uniquely sized charger plugs
i like this kensington model so much that i have just purchased another as a gift .
this is a nice looking and space saving <NUM> socket outlet
i replaced an old powersquid with this unit and it has worked as expected
i really like the color coded sockets and the circular design , which resulted in a smaller footprint .
the amazon page gives dimensions of the package
here are some specifics regarding the product alone : 15 oz : weight , not incuding cord , measured on my kitchen scales6
5 inches : outside diameter of circular part2 inches or a little less : height , with nothing plugged into itthe underside of the circular part is flat with six flat rubber legs/pads upon which it rests
therefore , it does not slip on my granite countertop
problem that this product solved : my kitchen and den are separated by a granite countertop , and on the den side my easy chair is backed right up to that countertop
i wanted sockets that could be accessed from either side , for cooking appliances ( in the kitchen ) or for plugging in my ipad or kindle ( while using them in the den )
i can not imagine why an outlet wasn not thought of when my house was first built
i was going to call an electrician to add one , but this power strip seems to work just as well
how it solved my problem : the power strip does not budge or fall off the counter even when i am using the plugged in ipad
i could only make it slip off if i pulled it hard in a horizontal direction
the cord is long enough to reach the nearest wall outlet in the den
the price ( $40+ ) seemed high a first , but getting an electrician out here would have cost a lot more .
i love the round design on this
the design allows for you to use big plug in adapters and not have it take up another outlet
i use this in my office and it works well .
this works perfectly for what i needed it for
it fits adaptors well and the circular shape is definitely welcomed verses just a strip
this also has a long cord which is incredibly helpful ! definitely a good buy !
used it in team gathering/meeting areas to allow multiple users quick , access to power
the round format is nice for a centralized location .
the current protection is good , the design is clever , and it feels much sturdier than my power strips
but why does it cost $40 ?
this circular outlet is perfect for the area under our oval conference table at work , where we hold many training sessions
we have used it for many months and not had any issues with it
it is heavy enough that it stays in place , and light enough that i can lean down , yank it over , plug in something and shove it back under the table without having to crawl underneath
it is very sturdy and seems to have taken all our ( and our trainees' ) abuse without any problems
perfect for areas where a long power strip won not work or would be less convenient .
this does exactly what i needed : it provides a surge strip with plenty of room for transformer wall warts
some of the pluses : 1 ) the cord is nice and long and the plug is flat so it can go behind furniture
2 ) the outlets are color coded and it includes a couple of sets of corresponding color cord stickers you can put on device cords so you know what device you are unplugging when the cords all look alike
3 ) the device itself is actually smaller than it appears in the pictures
for me , that is good because it takes up less space
the footprint is roughly the size of a salad plate
4 ) like most other plug strips , there are slots on the back to allow it to be mounted on a wall , the side of a desk or on the bottom of a shelf
i am very satisfied with my purchase .
it is small enough to sit om my desk and large enough to hold all of my chargers it eliminated the cord clutter on the desk and the colour code is fantastic and it is approved by ul and csa expensive but well worth it will recommed to my friends
i already own one of these surge protectors and like it very much
so when the need arose to purchase a second surge protector i went with another kensington 62634
for me the major selling point is the sixteen foot cord
i am very happy i purchased the same surge protector a second time
today , i finally became temporarily not lazy , opened the box
it already has three outlets being used
i ordered another one but returned it when i found a better product by kensington from another online store
of course the new model is much more expensive .
this is a great power strip
as many reviewers have pointed out , the design allows you to use all the sockets , as the sockets on standard rectangular power strips are often so close together that a plug for one device may block one or more sockets next to it
it is also the most stable power strip that i own , as the round configuration keeps it solid on the floor exactly where you put it , even on carpet -- instead of leaning , lifting , and sliding around like many rectangular power strips ( another plus that other reviewers have noted )
i also like the angled plug that plugs the power strip into the wall
this allows the cord to point on an angle toward the floor , which helps conceal the cord and keep the power strip stable
the only reason i did not give it five stars is that the cord that connects the power strip to the wall socket is too long
i would have been happier with with an <NUM> to <NUM> inch cord , as opposed to several foot length of this cord
having all this extra cord to some extent defeats the purpose of what is otherwise an unobtrusive and compact power strip .
i grabbed this quick on cyber monday not noticing it was a table top unit
i have too many electronics by my bed and had one of those small white strip surge outlets
the problem was <NUM> of the <NUM> items i charge there have those transformer big plugs so i hade to plug and unplug all the time
with this one i can plug in my decorative lamp , floor ott light , alarm clock , tablet , nintendo ds and breathing machine
everything is now neat and i don not have to keep switching things out
at most only <NUM> items are in use at one time
i like the quick on and off button i can lean over and hit should i choose to
the unit is very well made and i expect many years of good service from it .
with a new hp touchscreen computer , i also needed a minimal footprint surge protector - this really answered my need on a modestly sized desk top
thank you kensington .
we recently placed this smartsockets power strip under our conference room table
it looks good and has plenty of room for some of those larger adapters
we don not use or need the color coding , but it does add to the visual appeal of the unit in a professional setting .
well since most reviews have gone into the specifics of this device , i won not delve too deeply into those aspects
however , very rarely did i see any mention of how cheap of a device this is ; the plastic feels of very low grade , the reset button litterally rattles it is so loose
overall , yes the device works , so i won not knock it for that ; unfortunately i have no means of testing the actual , but i just have to hope that they used better quality electronic components then they used for the case build
pros of the device : -----------------------+smart circle design ; obviously the main advantage of this is taht you are no longer limited by annoying power bricks taking up/blocking outlets
for that it works great
+cute design ; it looks slightly better than a normal surge protector with its circle form factor and brightly color coded outlets ; however , the design is slightly hindered by how cheap the materials are , and looks less cute in person
+long cord ; 16ft is pretty long , so make sure you need that long of a cord , since the average cord length is around for a surge protector
still for my application , a long cord is a plus ( since i needed at least a 12ft cord )
cons : ----------really bad build quality ; again , just super cheap plastic , and the reset button is really wobbly , barely feels like it is held on
the cord seems of decent gauge/insulation at least , and the device has some heft so it may just be cheap on the exterior
-no swivel outlet ; for the cost of this device , it really should come with a swivel outlet connection , so if your outlet is ( connected to a light switch ) or you need it to go to the right of the socket , the cord will be tweaked in the wrong direction
i have no problems with cheap protectors not having a rotating outlet , but on something that costs almost $40 it really should have included it
summary : -------look , if we are rating the device on whether it provides power or not , of course it works , and should get <NUM> stars
the circle design is also very nice , and again worthy of some stars
but with how poor the build quality is on this ( and this was ordered from amazon directly , not 3rd party ) , and the fact that they didn not even throw in nicer features like a swivel socket for how pricey this retails for , i can not give this a fantastic rating ( but will still give it an ok rating as it does in fact work , but that alone doesn not deserve <NUM> stars )
i purchased the device on a sale , and even at the price i am still debating on if i should keep it or not
i have several surge protectors from all sorts of brands , and as such i am somewhat disappointed with what should have been a nicer protector feeling and looking so cheap
i'd say for a sale price it might be worth it , or if you are really looking for a longer cord surge protector it might be worth it ( although i have several protectors that didn not cost near this much ) , but i have purchased much better protectors at even better prices when they go on sale .
the circular design saves desk space and the extra long cord is helpful in setting up in an office cubicle
there is central power button that turns off all the items plugged into the colorful base
the colors are not the same , so different appliances can be assigned a different color
useful if you have to unplug on device to use in another room or location .
i love this because of the sixteen foot cord
so versatile in where you can use it
highly recommend to anyone !
this works well on a conference table , like for class sessions with multiple laptops
will hold <NUM> of the larger powersupply type plugs if needed
these come in handy
functional as well as attractive with the different colors
the color scheme allows instant identification of cables with stickers that come with it .
i bought this for use on my desktop
the shape makes it very convenient for use with power cords and the odd shaped transformer packs for cell phones , hard drives etc
the power switch on top is convenient if you want to shut it off to avoid wasting energy on the plugged in items when not in use
nice long power cord , heavy base keeps it from moving around to much
highly recommended .
i am the very satisfied owner of the palm v connected organizer
i had long wanted a hand held organizer , one that would have both computer interchangeable abilities and one that would be able to perform different applications
christmas day was a happy one for me last year , not only because of the brimming smiles on my children is faces ; but because that is when i received the palm v as a gift from my santa ( my wife ! )
after giving the product and it is instructions a look over , within moments i was on my way and began the charging procedures necessary prior to it is use
this was my only initial disappointment , having to wait for the initial charging that takes <NUM> hrs
i couldn not wait to tinker with my new toy , and it was a bit annoying
after completing the charge up , i installed the cd that came with the product to familiarize myself with it
the cd is both quite informative and very easy to follow
then i was ready to begin to learn about my new toy
looks can be deceiving when it comes to the appearance of the palm v
in viewing the device , with it is ultra sleek , thin design ; one might come to the conclusion it could be nothing more than your basic address/date book
this little &quot ; power packer&quot ; ( as i like to call it ) is simply amazing ! the applications that can be utilized with the palm v as well as the storage capacities are as follows : 1 ) address book : that holds up to <NUM> addresses2 ) appointment record : that records up to <NUM> appointments3 ) functioning : that can receive up to <NUM> messages4 ) memo pad : that can hold up to <NUM> memos5 ) to do list : that records up to <NUM> items6 ) expense reports7 ) games8 ) security9 ) calculator ( all storage figures are approximate , and flexible according to the overall storage capacity of <NUM> mb ) the palm v also comes complete with the necessary software to facilitate all functions on the organizer
other items that came with my palm v were the synchronizing cradle &amp ; battery recharger , the handbook , an adapter , a protective cover , and one metal stylus and a spare plastic one
while the palm v comes to you with all the stated in my epinion , it also has the capability of being able to receive downloads from the internet to expand its functions , or to simply download games to play on this hand held device
the ease of operation of the palm v is remarkable
on it is face are are <NUM> buttons on the metal frame and an area on screen with <NUM> buttons ( to be used with the stylus ) , as well as an area for information input or free hand graffiti writing
all of these help the user quickly and efficiently operate the palm v to expedite the tasks at hand
the device also has a back light that can come in rather handy
input of information into the palm v can be done in a number of ways
one can access the keyboard on the device , or use special graffiti free hand writing to input the desired material
the device may also be directly hooked up to your pc and the information typed in with your computer is keyboard
the greatest thing about the palm v is the ability to transfer data between the device and your computer
the ability to be able to access , download information from the internet or your computer , for me is a god send ; and in my opinion nothing sort of revolutionary ! to process the transference of information , the palm v needs to be placed into the hotsync cradle
then the user just presses the hotsync button on the device to perform the hotsync operation
it proves to be completely user friendly as far as the exchange between the organizer and the computer
maintaining your organizer requires as little as a few minutes charging a day of the palm v , by placing it in its cradle
no need to buy batteries , it is self contained with a lithium ion rechargeable battery
it is so small in size and weighs a mere <NUM> ounces , it easily is carried in a coat pocket ; both comfortably and unnoticed
my main use for the palm v is during my business hours
it is always on my person , for me to access at a moment is notice , to jot down things i need to remember ( which are many with my bad recall )
whether it be to record an appointment that i have just confirmed with a client , or a note to myself ; the palm v has become an invaluable device ; one that has proven to make my day much more pleasant and hassle free
no more need to run to a desk for a paper or pen , or to ask my callers to hold on ; i am always ready with my palm v on hand
if you do not have any prior experience with a hand held organizer of this kind , and always thought about purchasing one , i would highly recommend the palm v
once you have had a device like this , you will never want to be without one
just like all the modern luxuries in life , what you don not have you do without and don not miss ; but what you have had and have no longer , is greatly missed and still desired for easier living
thank you palm v for making my life , just a little bit easier !
a pretty good device overall , but one thing really bugs me
i have it in a leather case
i was carrying it in my hand one day and i dropped it
only one exposed area got a tiny speck of a nick , but the rest of the device was cushioned by the leather
that incident caused all the screen touch points to drop
in order to activiate something , i have to touch below where it is displayed on the screen
the functions on the bottom moved almost completely out of range , and the writing area shifted down also
i can not tell if it is because the writing area shifted downwards , but the graffiti recognition is slower and less accurate too
i can not say anything else bad about it , but what a letdown to know that it can not take simple impacts .
january 15 , <NUM> 3com is palm pda is are definitely the best pda is on the market
you can read the other reviews to hear how this device will help you organize your life and how wonderful it is
as a palm collector ( i have all palm and pilot models ) , i will rather compare the palm v to the palm vx
the only difference between the two is that the v has 2mb of ram , while the vx has 8
i have thousands of addresses , thousands of appointments , and many more items , documents , etc
in my palm
i also have fax , , and internet software installed , among many other programs
i only use about 1
5 mb
therefore , although i have the vx , i don not use any of the additional memory
technically , because of the additional memory , the vx is faster
nonetheless , because palm applications are so small , this difference is truly negligible
therefore , before you spend $100 more on the vx , make sure you are going to use the additional memory
it is the only difference
now , remember : the v series is rechargable , while the iii series uses aaa batteries
therefore , travelling with a v palm means you will have to carry around the cradle
if you'd rather use batteries , maybe the iiix is better for you
good luck !
a quick take on my perception of the good and bad points of this device , and some suggestions from a vetran palm upgrader ( i have returned and repruchased these machines a little too many times ! ) there are a few things i love about this device : 1
you don not end up changing batteries all the time like you did with previouis models 2
it costs lesser than the palm vx 3
synchronization with outlook <NUM> is flawless 4
the screen is very readable in bright outdoors 5
the battery lasts and lasts ( they aren not energizer bunnies ! ) things i do not like about this : 1
the choice of cases for this are kind of lousy
applications built into this device could have been a little more intuitive
overall perceptions : 1
good value for the money 2
buy a spare docking cradle if you move this between home and work pcs ( accompany sells them for dirt cheap if you are in the right buying cycle ) 3
do not attempt to browse the web on this
you will only be disappointed .
i had trouble the first week getting the palm to hotsync to my thinkpad , and the palm <NUM> even crashed once , losing all my data before the hotsync was working
since then this thing has become an essential part of my life
works like a charm , both the palm <NUM> itself and the hotsync too
address book , calendar , notes
the palm is easily the best designed hardware/software since the macintosh of the late 1980 is
by the way , i am also using the franklin/covey software for personal management and find this is a nice increment over the daily task list of the palm .
i have had my palm v since june 1st
to my brother , wife &amp ; parents who conspired for my birthday : thank you ! within two weeks i abandoned my franklin planner , and regretted not having had a palm device <NUM> years ago
ok , that was impossible - but it has dramatically changed my life for the better , and i can not imagine ever going without it
in the last several months i have grown to be a very definite power user , and the corporate resource person for pda is
our guys have tried several others and are convinced that the palm platform is the best and most flexible
i am very heavily into software evaluation ( &amp ; some accessories ) , preparing recommendations for palm device/software packages for issue
eventually i may put together my own personal , and post some evaluations and recommendations for software/accessories for palm users
having said all that , here is an engineer is ( my ) perspective on the palm v : visors will be great , and palm iiix is are just fine , but the palm v package size is definitely worth a lot to me
forget the sexy appearance - it is great , but the superior form factor rules
yes , i would prefer that the vx cost is about what the standard v discounts for now , but since it will always fit in my shirt pocket ( without changing my shirt wardrobe ) i always have it with me ( in a place that is probably least susceptible to being damaged or lost ) - and that is what it is for
though i prefer to use the slim padded 3com case , i frequently slip the original leather on for small shirt pockets , &amp ; thus can still carry a separate pen/pencil/stylus device
a big plus with those covers that i have never seen in a review : the soft "grabby" texture of the spine flex keeps the palm from sliding , even if you do
. it doesn not fall out on the floor ! ( very big benefit since the cover isn not a padded case
) likes : i like being able to keep synced with both my office laptop and my home desktop ( with the included ms outlook conduit )
autocharging in the docking cradle
a battery that is never gotten below a
nice screen
the size
i really like the unit overall - a truly great device
any problems ? yep
i did have to get the updated patch from the chapura site to avoid some when synching
also , i highly recommend tealscript ( the graffitti ) for it is ability to help you tune up your handwriting speed/recognition - and it visually showed up a mysterious problem with the screen occasionally screwing up handwriting by adding a horizontal line : quickly replaced it under warranty , and it is been fine
memory space ? the average user probably will have no problem for a couple of years - i have met people with iii is that are using less than 1k
a year after they get it : they have seen &amp ; use very few aftermarket programs
however , i have got more programs in there than will fit : launcher , datebook , calc &amp ; memo replacements , travel programs , doc reader , picture viewer , several clocks , a dozen utility and security programs , over a dozen hackmaster hacks , and a few games
since flashpro gave me the extra 800k memory room ( awesome ) , i found i probably had enough that i could otherwise get by fine without deleting fluff programs - except that i use it heavily for work &amp ; software evaluation
the memory room of the vx would be heaven - the perfect device , i think
it'd be handy to carry a lot of maps , but my current standard p5 doesn not have the memory room without deleting , say , my picture viewer
( oh , the screen ? it is great ! yes folks , it is a <NUM> greyscale display ! ) probably i will upgrade to the vx &amp ; give my wife my standard v ( p5 ) unit : she thought it was no big deal when i got it , but has fallen in love with the capabilities and wants her own palm device
bottom line is that if you are a minimalist , the 2k of p5 memory is fine
but if you like to carry a gerber/leatherman/ device ( like i do ) because a pocketknife leaves you unprepared
better get a vx or get the 8mb upgrade on your p5
price ? when handspring comes out with something to compete with a vx , the price world will probably be great
yeh , p5 is are expensive compared to some of the lesser pda is - but compare the price to a palmtop computer , and they look like a great deal
especially considering the impact on your lifestyle
can i mention my essential programs list ? tough area , but currently i wouldn not give up these - listed in order of descending requirement : undupe ( get it ! ) , tealscript , travel clock , hackmaster , ( switchhack , stayoffhack , palmv hack , invert hack &amp ; invert , findhack , cathack ) , datebk3 ( &amp ; dbscan ) , backupbuddy , idpalm , flashpro , a good launcher - either commander or launchem have too many great enhancements to do without
accessories : writeright screen covers , throttle stylus/pen
i regard the palmv hack and stayoff hack as absolute essentials for palm v users , and invert with inverthack give proper screen display when the backlight is on
info ? o areilly is "palmpilot : the ultimate guide" is a fantastic reference for all palm owners .
i finally decided to spend the extra $$ for the palm v and give my old palm iii to my dad
afterall , i loved the styling , but more importantly wanted the slimmer size
unfortunately , when you use the hard cover that comes with the palm v and put it in your pocket , it causes the power button to turn on and then the up/down key constantly clicks
huh ? so then i went out and got the hard case ( a rip off if you ask me ) , causing the palm v to be just as thick as my palm iii
that left me wondering why i bothered spending all that extra money to get a palm no smaller than the one i already had
dad , can i get my palm iii back ?

the $ i put down for my palm v are some of the best dollars i have ever spent
prior to my palm v , i had a separate address book and calendar and lists and notes everywhere , all of which ended up getting lost or being in entirely different places when i needed them most
as a result , i often forgot to do things that needed to be done , lost important phone numbers , etc
-you get the idea
my palm v changed everything
now i keep everything important , from the standard addresses , to do is , notes , and appointments to my accounting info , stock portfolio , and local movie times ( thanks to avantgo
com ) all on my palm v , and it is great ! a warning to those buying palm v is , though
it takes time to get used to it ! i hated grafiti ( the &quot ; handwriting&quot ; you must use for the palm to recognize your input ) at first , and found the miniscule keyboard a pain
additionally , i saw no real point in keeping a to do list and all my appointments on the thing
after a month of forcing myself to do so , however , i was hooked ! after really taking the time to get familiar with the thing , i use it on the order of twenty times a day--far more than i have used any other device ( digital or pen and paper )
so , my buying advice : buy one ! palm v is are absolutely fantastic , really ! they are beautifully designed ( you won not feel geeky pulling one out ! ) and the handiest things in the world
i promise ! ( be sure to buy one of the hard cases to keep it beautiful
the palm v and vx may have seemed totally awesome , but i never fell for the hype
the palm v and vx have a rechargeable lithium battery
when it is day is done , there is an agonizing choice : go for a replacement one of these , have the battery replaced and risk it not working correctly , or buying something that as one user suggested could run off of easily replaceable aaa batteries
the palm v and vx were never cool enough to overcome that stigma for me
if you can find that the palm v/vx has an acceptable set of trade offs and opportunity cost , to quote a drop dead gorgeous economics teacher i had , then it is definitely the belle of the ball
if on hand b you are practical , and want more steak and less sizzle from your handheld , the palm vii or palm viix may be a far better option
just alerting you to something the positive reviews may gloss over .
when i hear pda , i would like to now envision a device that may look roughly like the palm v , but has a lot more packed in it
palm v is an excellent device and it is a great buy for the sake of the technology is first step
but , after using it for about a year now , i am being selfish
i want more memory , i want color , i want sound and i want a floating connection to the rest of the world
so , my advice - when you buy a pda , go for something with at least color and more memory ( for the sake of technology is next step )
you are going to run out of the palm v is 2mb if you are like me and like to download all those available applications
palm vx has 8mb memory which should be enough for the time being , but i want more ( sorry ! )
i am looking at the pda to be the materialisation of isaac asimov is vision of a hand held device which is carried by everyone in the world and has a unique identification number
so if you want to talk to your sister , just punch in her id number and there she is on the screen looking at you and yelling at you for buzzing her when she was in the shower ! our privacy is going to be under fire , but it is going to be fun all the same
asimov said that by 2010 , this will be a reality
and , the world is fast getting there
palm v is only an initial step ! my advice - go for the next step .
using my palm v always makes me smile because it is about as close to perfect as any electronic device i have ever used
if anyone is on the borderline , not sure if a pda is for them , this device will not disappoint
it does everything that you'd want it to do , does it well , and does it quickly
plus the ability to sync the palm v with your computer is pim ( inc
microsoft outlook ) makes importing and exporting contacts a breeze
if you are not sure about the graffiti writing system , i can tell you that it is a very easy to learn
five minutes worth of practicing and you will have it down ( it is very , very close to the normal alphabet )
after a few days you will have it completely memorized ( the palm folks also include a handy &quot ; cheat sheet&quot ; sticker that you can stick to the inside of the cover that is included with the palm v )
as someone who bought an apple newton messagepad ( and lived though that debacle ) i can say from experience that the palm is not a product that only a geek can love
anyone who is busy and wants to be able to keep track of contacts and appointments will find this device invaluable and i sincerely mean that
once you have one you will not want to be without it , and it sure beats hauling a fat old paper based organizer around
some quick notes ; the palm v hard case rocks ! if you travel a lot make sure to get one
it keeps the palm v completely safe from harm and looks beautiful
also , with the upgrade to palm os 3
3 , you will be able to sync your palm with any laptop with an infrared port without the need for any cables
this is very , very cool and very useful for road warriors ( one caveat here , the ir sync does not yet work on windows2000 based systems )
hope this helps !
well , it has taken three weeks and three different online companies to get the palm v to me
was it worth the wait ? you bet
although it is a bit pricey due to the shortage of flash ram and lcd screens
after filling up my address book , downloading and news ( through avantgo ) , as well as various applications and games i still have about 768k left
2mb may seem like a small amount of storage to some people , but it goes a long way as long as you manage your , games , and amount of avantgo channels you read
the hotsync operation only takes a few minutes , and i spent a total of five minutes learning the alphabet and numbering system of the graffiti language
once fully charged , the battery never seems to diminish no matter how much i use it
even though the palm v did not come with a nice checkbook program , i found a free one immediately at download
now that the us version is sold out in most places , i would highly recommend considering the international version as it seems like it is virtually the same as the us version with an international ac adapter .
this christmas i decided to treat myself to a palm computer
after reading the specs on the palm v and the palm iiie , i decided to buy the palm iiie
it seems that the only differences are about $200 , the palm v has flash ram making it upgradeable , the cool look of heat blasted anodized aluminum
i got a soft black leather case , which makes the palm iiie look as cool as the palm v
i feel that the palm iiie is more portable because you can get aaa batteries anywhere and do not have to rely on the cradle / charger
the funny thing is that i am still using my casio digital diary with <NUM> kb memory for my electronic organizing needs .
i was skeptical about using the palm , but once i started it quickly became indispensible
i have eight large rolodex files on it plus tons of memos and noto do' items
the 2mbyte of memory is still handling it with no problem
. give it five stars !
i can not believe this can still be reviewed
i don not have much to say , but i have a few old contacts still on my ten year old palm that i still havent transferred over
i know
the point is that my palm sits in my drawer and always powers on perfectly
i don not think i have even charged it in a few years
this thing is amazing in its longevity .
i have found a few places that will do memory upgrades for all the palm is
8m seems to be the max .
i bought one of these for my husband as an early father is day present , and he loves it
he says &quot ; because it is small and convenient , it is always there so you can make quick notes as needed
it is perfect for keeping track of incidental expenses much more easily than fumbling with notes and remembering things
another nice feature is that using the hotsynch connection , the pp easily transfers information back and forth from computer to the pp itself
this is especially effective when one uses outlook , and the pp will even allow you to write and store email which will automatically be sent later , if you choose
&quot ; he loves this thing , uses it all the time , and it certainly makes him more organized
his last word on it is : &quot ; i should have bought one a year ago ! &quot ; go for it folks , you won not be disappointed .
my palm v was wonderful , and i replaced it immediately when it was stolen--probably the best argument that i really got good value from it ! i had not used any form of portable computer , pda , or similar device before , but after just a few months i found mine indispensible
i chose the palm v over the other palms , and over any system because of the sliim profile
i can put it in the front pocket of my slacks and it is not obtrusive
the usefulness of the functions for keeping lists , addresses , and calendars is obvious
less obvious is using all the downloadable software available on the internet--often for free , but more often at a modest price , at least for the really useful stuff
i use the calendar book function in a way i suspect the designers didn not intend--i enter reminders to myself for a set date and time , so my alarm will go off and the palm will display a message such as &quot ; call norman now
&quot ; i also find the search function very useful
if i remember that i dealt with norman , but have forgotten his phone number or last name , i can have the palm search for &quot ; norman&quot ; and display his name and address ( assuming i entered it when i first talked to him ) as well as any notes or memos i wrote about our discussion
you can do this for any word or name , so if i remember discussing widgets with a guy , but have forgotten his name or phone or company , i can search for &quot ; widgets&quot ; and again everything i have entered on the subject will be available
in fairness , i have to say that if you don not have a fairly busy life , you may not have much use for it , but if your life is a busy one , i predict you will find the palm v ( or palm vx ) invaluable
this includes people who aren not &quot ; executives
&quot ; stressed--out students or overwhelmed homemakers will find it useful .
this was one of palm is real groundbreaking handhelds , with it is sleek case and low weight
still a great handheld but only has <NUM> mb of memory and lacks the sd slot that the new palms are being manufactured with
if you just need a calendar and address book , this will do it , but the m100 will do just about the same (
) ( with albeit a much smaller screen )
the backlight on the palm v is woeful like the backlights on all palms , but is not needed too often .
ive gone from the palmpilot pro two years ago to the palm iii and now have the palm v , so i definitely appreciate how small and thin the v is , and how much clearer the screen is than on the previous models
a few months ago my palm v fell from a stack of books on to the floor face down , shattering the screen
i called 3com , and they charged me <NUM> dollars to replace it , and sent a refurbished one that came in two days
i was satisfied with the process , and its good to know that they understand how important it is to be back in action fast as possible
the leather flip cover that comes with the v works very well to protect the screen while in your pocket , and eventually begins to have the comforting worn leather feel of a wallet , which adds to the over aesthetics of this product
a less obscure point is that it becomes very easy to get attached to carrying the palm v around just as much as you carry a wallet
i can use the infrared port on the palm v to connect to my gsm phone ( ericsson i888 on omnipoint ) , and get regular internet access
( requires proxinet , irdalink software , and a standard isp )
its not the most functional thing in the world- but it actually works
there is so much good shareware out there for the palm ( tetris , document readers and books , finance calcs , customizing hacks etc
) , and even a computer novice can easily learn how to download and install new programs with relative ease .
i was forced to buy the aluminum case for my because the power would consistently come on while it was in my pocket
if you intend to carry this around as a pocket device , you will be stuck with investing in a case
beware .
although the palm v is more appealing than the iii it is essentially the same technology
i have had one wear out and die , another just fail and &quot ; reboot&quot ; itself alot , another fail from getting a little wet
i love these things but for me the extra $150 for the v translates into $175 per year vs $100 per year , assuming it lasts two years .
i owned a palm iii for a while when it came out , and then stepped up to the v after about a year with my iii
what can i say ? i was allured by its sexiness and general asthetic appeal
i have now relied on it for about a year for all my organizing needs
i have used every part of the palm software suite except the expense reporting feature
while i like the palm v is style , i have become more and more disappointed by its features and memory issues
features : lacks decent sound for starters , a beep is boring and weak
when i carry the palm in its home ( my pocket ) i cannot hear the alarm tones even with volume maxed ! the screen is a mixed bag
while its clarity is better than other organizers , it is very hard to read in slightly dim areas because the backlighting leaves a lot to be desired
battery power is okay , but not anywhere near the advertised time of <NUM> days
memory is a whole different issue
all i have on my palm is some <NUM> addresses and <NUM> calendar entries and it tells me i am half full , as you know they advertise a lot more capacity
i don' use but a couple of aftermarket programs
the graffiti recognizer is crap
when it works it puts the wrong letters on the screen
real users need to get jot ! from cic
palm , inc
is tech support is the worst ! most of their support staff can hardly speak english ; so imagine them trying to explain a highly technical issue ! whats more , they don not even care
i was pormised a return call - had to call back
i have not once ever received a real response by email - only autoresponders that say &quot ; hours&quot ; - still waiting on my inquiry from january ! in short , save a little longer and get the cassiopeia ( when it comes out )
in my experiences with comparrisons of cassiopeia to my palm v , the cassio was a true frontrunner ! the will certainly be even better ! if you need a great datebook and address book to keep you straight and don not need sound , memory , genuine word processing , or spreadsheet , or color screen then go with the palm v ! but if you need features and real performance , get a windows ce device .
i needed one centralized location for all my information , especially appointments and phone numbers
the palm v has given me exactly that
i have installed a couple of shareware applications , but have not found that i use them , so the <NUM> mb memory is going to be fine for me
the interface is elegant and simple , and it is easy to input data with the stylus
after using the included cover , and then trying the leather case , i finally ended up with the hard case , and i like it the best
all the palm users who talk about how it has changed their lives are not just blowing smoke
this device has succeeded where countless paper organizers and calendars have failed
and it is fun , and looks cool !
the palm v is one of those electronic gizmos you don not think you will ever need , and then when you get one you can not live without it
i have been carrying mine around like a pacifier
when someone stops me on the street and wants to set up and appointment i used to take their number and check my calendar back at the office
now i can take their number and make the appointment
3com has packaged a proven product in a sexy case and come up with a real winner .
i received my palm vx in 2001
it is now march of 2008 , and i am still actively using it
i am so very grateful
there have been some scary times when i thought the end had arrived , but i was wrong
the problem ended up being so crazy
a button was stuck
consequently , the unit would run out of juice and not charge
once i figured that out , i have been able to revive it without much incident
i have read many of the reviews about the tungsten e2 and am quite discouraged about buying it
thus , i will continue to offer life support as long as this palm vx allows
it has served me so very well !
i spent about <NUM> months trying to decide whether an organizer could be worth this much money
i just bought my palm v last week , and it is hard to imagine life without it now
the palm v is simply the best purchase i have made in a long time
it is an incredibly small and sleek little machine
it fits right in your shirt pocket , even with the hard case i bought for it
it has all the standard things you'd expect from an organizer ( address book , to do list , agenda , expense report )
the graffiti system ( writing instead of typing ) only takes a little while to get used to
the palm desktop software and cradle allows you to back everything up in a few seconds
no batteries are necessary , because you can recharge the palm vin the cradle
hundreds of extra programs and games can be downloaded
if you are trying to decide which palm to buy , i definitely recommend the v
the vx is about the same , but it has more memory ( which i don not think i will need ) and costs a lot more , the iii series is great but not as sleek , and the vii has the modem , which doesn not interest me much
go for the palm v
if you are trying to decide whether it is worth the money , the answer is a resounding yes !
i love my palm v ! i won it over the internet and now i don not leave home without it ! very simple to use and extremely useful
i store telephone numbers , my date book , grocery lists , myriads of other lists for work and home , and just yesterday i downloaded a trial copy of splashphoto that lets me show a slide show of family pictures on my palm v
a great electronic toy !
great and slightly more sturdy version of the popular palm
i like the metal casing
i hate the fact that when you put the unit in your shirt pocked it is very easy to create pressure on the buttons and pretty soon the device is scrolling and clicking away .
i love these inserts
i used to print on cardstock and cut out my own labels
my lines never turned out straight and i always ended up with inserts that were too large or too small
with these , i end up with a great looking label label that fits perfectly
in the product description , it might have been helpful to mention that the software isn not available for mac
i am going to attempt to figure out another way to get it done using these , but not sure if i will be able to .
i needed to read the description better
however i feel i need to say that this paper is pretty much like a thicker printer paper , not really cardboard or glossy
and the printing comes out rather flat
of course i have used memorex before , but have always used glossy before , so they make great products , but this one is pretty much of no use to me
but it is mainly my fault for not reading more carefully .
fast delivery and great product
product does exactly what i need and the price works very well for me ! will keep on buying these for as long as i need to .
ummm the paper is slightly thicker than regular paper
it never jammed my printer
it has perforated lines for folding but it didnt work out like that for my printer
maybe i aint doing something right but to gets the job done so whatever
i am slowly getting my program cd is into jewel cases and needed a way to label them
i am going far too slowly to try doing the labels on a computer and am them
they fit well and do what i need to do .
these days , people seem to have forgotten what jewel cases are , but these inserts are a definite step up from the scissors and printer paper method
they don not look especially good or fit better than adequately , but they are better than
see above .
i read the many reviews here on this product before ordering and was somewhat concerned that so many seemed to have a problem with the software
i found the software to be easy to use although like my disc label burning software ( fellows/neato ) , i had to experiment a little to figure out how to align pictures of the dvd covers/inserts correctly
i spent maybe <NUM> minutes and then began printing ( i use standard paper to figure out the alignment issues as to not waste the actual covers/inserts )
some have said they would like a glossy paper option and i agree
this paper gives a somewhat dull picture quality but i still find it to be ok
if i has the option for glossy paper i would purchase that instead
i back up mostly movie dvds and would like a more brilliant quality output
if i were backing up data dvds , i would not have an issue with the paper quality
i have not used any other brands so i cannot , at this time , give a contrasting opinion of other products
i plan on trying other products though to see if any others do a better job for my movie dvd cover/insert needs
i will update later as i get more data on this subject
for now i will say these covers are a good value for the money .
these labels are perfect for what they are supposed to do and are pre fit exactly to the space provided and are exactly what i was shopping for .
i have tried an awful lot of cd inserts and these are by far the most cost effective and functional
i just love them .
the template prints a little off and these are pretty much just pieces of cardstock paper , but for a cheap insert these are good
they tear off of the sheet easily and fit perfectly in jewel cases .
these are fine
they are not glossy , but they are measured right and very good for home made covers of dvds and cd is , there were some whiny reviews , but remember they are not pro photo paper
they work just fine though and look good .
i will definitely be back to get more of these i like these because they are easy to work with .
i have a recording studio so i make a lot of cd is
most of my artists gives me the information they want on the cd & jewel case insert & i do the rest
i hope memorex never stops making these inserts & amazon never stop carrying them
i go through several thousand a year .
purchased as a gift for daughter
she was very satisfied with quality and the colors to help her arrange her music by catagory
good price and great seller
prompt ship .
these jewel case inserts worked very well , but what makes this a is the software from memorex that makes it easy to set the titles and import pictures
they also supply you with many interesting backgrounds for your labels and jewel case inserts
this is the same software for the cd labels , so it makes it easy to learn
i was able to supply our kids with dvds of them as children , each with their individualized jewel case and dvd label
made a great christmas present .
very easy to use and they fit very well
good , cheap labels that work very well with my printer
thanks !
the title of my review says it all
i am running a very old jewel case designsoftware program
nevertheless , this product works perfectly and producesvery professional looking results .
these labels are great for cd is and dvd is
the labels have perforations in the paper to give excellent neatness that gives your projects a professional look
great for thin and thick media holders .
as two previous posters have mentioned , there is a problem with this product -- there is no template readily available for their use
the packaging directs you to a memorex site that is defunct
you can search and find a program that promises it will do what you need , while also installing potentially harmful adware on your computer as well
i would not install it as it seemed unsafe
i tried contacting memorex , but go no response
this left no real options for their use
i needed to print my inserts asap , though , and didn not have time to find something else so i divised a template of my own -- with trial and error , it worked , more or less
it was very time consuming , though
memorex should pull this product off the shelves if they aren not going to legitimately support it .
these worked very well first time and every time so far on my printer
i'd been printing my inserts on paper before so these are a vast improvement ; the perforations make it easy to separate the parts .
i love the grade of the paper and ease of perforated edges makes it easy to insert and look "pro"
you can find the templates online at the memorex referred website
i only wish they had a more professional grade photo paper , it would definitely be worth whatever extra cost
even a <NUM> pack of paper ! possibly a better "economy" template as well , so i don not waste so much of the <NUM> x10
memorex is a brand name that does offer excellent product support , and certainly this product is excellent for two reasons
first , because it is easy to use
cover art from cd is that have missing artwork can be relatively easily dropped into the blank template software provided at the memorex website , and you can create cover art that functionally replaces the missing original artwork inside the jewel cases for your cd collection
where it gets tricky - if darn near impossible - is creating the rear front insert printing
but if you are looking to put a cover and a tray insert in quick and fast this is the product
the instructions for creating cover art that looks decent or is very spare if not available at all
part of the reason for this is that <PERCENT> of all retail cd cover art and jewel case inserts are printed on glossy paper and not the type of paper that ships with this product
the maxell product , however , is on matte paper
this requires attention to detail when selecting inkjet printer settings , as you want to use the amount of ink that is usually dispersed for , say , a matte greeting card
if you use the incorrect setting , you can often spoil the insert by using entirely too much ink and creating a "wavy" effect in the art that will doom your intentionally perfect effort to the waste bin
so do a few test runs before you make a final copy - or at least expect you will use to get used to the product if it is the first time you are making cover art
the format of the and sheet is excellent , however
but there are some bits of advice worth considering when removing the cover art
as the manufacturer indicates , you will want to fold along the seams that need to be torn in order to get a somewhat clean cut from the 8
5" x 11" sheet
you won not get the seamless cut you get , say , from avery business card stock of the premium variety , but you will get an acceptably clean cut if you follow this rule
also be careful not to tear the perforations on the rear art that are meant to be where the folds are
i did this on the first sheet and had to repeat ! the software enables you to line up the different edges of the original cover art to the template itself - but as with anything on a printer , make sure your printer is lined up correctly with the paper so you don not have any overlap
my advice is to slightly oversize the original art ( easy to do if you have a basic understanding of image editing software ) so that you can be sure you have a complete piece of art without white edges on top , bottom , or either side
it takes some tweaking - it is not as simple as just dragging , dropping , and printing
all that said , this product is more than adequate - software and inserts - for making gift mix cd is
the intuitive software guides you through the processes of creating cover art with either custom or stock image backgrounds , and placing track lists on your inserts
in fact the software is so useful , i am considering the use of the software with my own sheets sourced from another paper supplier , and then cutting the art myself from standard sheet stock
in short this product is adequate for replacement of cover art of cd is to be sold at retail , or to give a faceless cd a new jewel case home for your personal collection
but if you are looking for perfection in recreating major record label quality cover art , then look elsewhere
alternatively if you are making your own cd is to be jewel cased as gifts or to create dvd rom cover art for custom projects - business or personal - this would be an excellent product
for example creating a professional portfolio or storage cases for personal media would be two excellent uses for this product
since i have almost one hundred of these sheets , i will work my way through them
but because i have customers who demand perfection in their purchases , i am going to have to begin a thorough search for a product that maintains more of that specific aesthetic
on value and price this is an excellent product - certainly much cheaper than the retail locations where i had seen them locally
and again if you are using these for personal data storage , products , or whatnot , these are excellent
that said they provide an exacting and demanding customer an ersatz product , that , if printed on a low dpi printer , can appear even - dare i say - kitschy
but with amazon prime offers and excellent delivery , i am not throwing stones at retailers - just letting consumers know that if you are looking for what i was looking for - replacement cover art with the aesthetic of that of the major record labels , you will need to do a little more digging out on the market for a good fit .
i got these to label <NUM> dvds that i was mailing out for a fundraiser convention
creating the design wasn not too horribly difficult
but after printing , it took a few minutes each label , to tear out and put together into a cd case
i wasn not expecting the puzzle
there are several different ; you end up with more ripped off bits and pieces then actual pieces for the case
then getting it to go together in the case was like a game
if i had just been making a personal cover/label for my own dvd , it wouldn not have seemed like such a hassle
but making 40 , i had to do it over the course of <NUM> days
it was quite tiring
i guess , for the price i paid , they at least got the job done
but don not expect an easy process , is all i am saying
i felt like i isigned up' for something i hadn not quite bargained for
'course , i have also never assembled my own cd cover before , so it could very well be like this with all of them .
software that you download is a little tricky but once you get used to it it works as it says
paper isn not the heaviest of card stock but that is ok
serves its purpose
i would buy again .
i used these to make covers for slim lined cd jewel cases
the photo and music list lined up perfectly , without adjustment because i used memorex jewel cases
the only issue i had was with the design software
i never could figure out how to import the list from my burn program into the templet for the covers
all the icons and instructions were clear , but the did not work
i could see the list download from the cd in the drive , and it showed up in the software library , but it would not insert into the proper frame on the cd cover
ended up typing it in manually
also missing was any button to control the layers between the text and the photo
it defaults to placing text first then inserting your photo
i could not find a way to bring the text to the foreground
so i reversed the process , placing the photo first and then the text on top
the paper quality was thick enough for use in the slim case , however i wish it had a gloss to it
the photo came flat and a bit muted , even after changing out all the ink in the printer
used this for a give away music cd for a party
it was fine for what i was doing , however i would not use it on a professional work project .
as a network administrator in an enterprise enviornment i agree that generally you wouldn not use this card in a corporate enviornment
but large companies buy products in bulk and they get the deals that the everyday user doesn not get
but , in all honesty you could probaly run this card with no problems on an enterprise level network -- the performance is great especially for $15
but for general networking in a medium sized/soho enviornment you can not beat it
this card seems to work with every system i have installed it on -- no matter the platform or os
its cheap , well documented , and easy to install
is there anything else really to say ?
others have written about poor manuals and shoddy components
this might be true
i am not a beginner with network software or hardware but i am hardly a pro either
i had zero problems installing this ( manual seemed fine to me ) and haven not had any problems using it since
btw i use it to hook into my dsl connection
if it didn not work i'd just send it back ( amazon is always been great about this )
and the price is just too hard to pass up .
i have <NUM> of these nic is running here at home and i also have a 10/100 hub from netgear
it was so simple to install
i tried another brand nic first and could not get my computer to boot up on them
i took them back and got netgear
plugged them in and it worked the first time
i don not know about you , but i hate &quot ; hard to install hardware&quot ; a great buy at amazon
! i need one more so i am buying it here
thank is amazon
i am moderately comfortable with my pc is innards , but i am no hardware guru
therefore , i was extremely pleased when this card installed with the ease the documentation ( and other amazon reviewers ) promised
the low price was icing on the cake .
the fellow that reviewed several before me made a good point
you don not want to use this in an enterprise environment
duh ! i am an mcse and i wouldn not recommend this card to any company , but , for the home there is absolutely nothing wrong with this card
it works and you can get <NUM> or <NUM> at the price of one of those big dog names
do those work times better ? no , they don not
i have <NUM> pc is of my own at home
6 altogether in there and all have different nic cards
netgear performs just as well as the others and i wouldn not complain if i had one of their cards in every one of those machines
so , in short , setting up a corporate lan/wan ? then don not pick up one of these cards
got a couple of computers or just one and want to play network games with friends
save a few bucks and go buy one of these and use what you saved on something else .
simply put , the netgear fa310tx works
it is an extremely simple card , but not much is required in a ethernet card
those of you needing wol support ( why ? ! ) should not purchase this card , as it does not support it
the speed and throughput is consistant with more expensive cards , my lan does not require speeds up to 100mbps anyway , but it is good to know it is there
the cards are good priced , so it will not cost much to outfit a small network with these cards , i have one in every desktop in our lan
they work , what more could you ask ?
can not be any finer with how compatible it is , and how bullet proof they made these
i am glad that these were available still , they are prefect for 100mbps network access
i wish they would get into fiber at a systematic speed sheet .
i use this card for my home network , and it has never given me trouble
i reccomend it for people wanting to quickly get a home network up and running
provided you pay attention to the network configuration requirements for your particular os , this card is most unlikely to give you trouble
if you think you have a card problem carefully recheck your config work a few times first before blaming the card
this card works great in red hat linux and windows
it is the only netgear card certified for red hat linux 7
as a matter of fact i am ordering a 4th card to replace a linksys card right now
i am involved in linux and am presently converting an emachines box to a <PERCENT> red hat linux <NUM> machine
i ran into trouble with the linksys fastethernet 10/100 ( version 2 ) card in this box
it turns out red hat <NUM> can see that card , but not the linksys chip , so i need to replace it
end of my use of linksys cards ( but they work just great in windows networks and i have a complete network running for a client as well
) i will probably stick to netgear in the future .
work well in linux , 98 , me , nt and win2k
i use these cards and the linksys pci cards all over my network , both work great .
this nic is very robust as it is easily installed in any windows computer or even a linux box
netgear is website is done very well , in which you can get tech support issues resolved quite easily
i never had to contact tech support due to any of their items that i have purchased
their web site support is superb
i highly recommend any of netgear is products .
i work in cable modem operations
we have some customers who buy cheap , and often problematic nic is , ony to face hours of endless troubleshooting on nic issues
the netgear is one of their biggest problems
made of flimsy greenboard and &quot ; ? &quot ; type chinese components , netgear is crusade of inexpensive nic is has made a joke of consistentcy
the price may be attractive , yet you would be to find any company who would commit to using netgear nic is throughout their operation : simply because the service and quality is inconsistent
netgear is customer support is short of laughable , as well
you get what you pay for
from my point of view , i would avoid netgear , linksys , or any other &quot ; &quot ; nic and consider looking for one more dependable
you may pay a little more for a 3com , intel , and smc , but they are worth the price
they offer the consistency and stability every nic user should demand - not just a discount price .
i have bought over <NUM> of these for home and office use
they work flawlessy and for the price you cannot beat the functionality
i was running windows <NUM> or windows <NUM> on all the computers
setup was a snap
just pop in the card to an empty slot
then install the drivers from the floppy disk that comes in the package
worked flawlessly everytime
i had no problems hooking up the ethernet card to a linksys dsl/cable router , netgear ethernet hubs , or a college dorm ethernet connection
get this card and you will get the convenience of file and print sharing when used in conjunction with some sort of hub and windows network neighborhood
anyone with little to no computer expertise can do this just by following the instructions
it may be a little difficult if you are scared of computers , but it can still be done
just follow the pictures that come on the step by step setup foldout .
i took this hub out of the box , plugged it in , connected it to our internal network and my two pc is about two months ago , and it has worked flawlessly ever since
all without reading the manual ! this hub is perfect for me because i occasionally attach a legacy 10mbps device and don not need more than three ports ( other than to link to our existing network )
one warning - if you have other netgear hubs and equipment , keep the power supplies separate
i had a 100mbps hub and got the power supplies mixed up
the unit looked like it was working but actually wasn not
the power supplies look similar , the plugs are the same , but i think the current and/or voltages are different
other than that , this is a great product
as i said earlier , it just works
when you factor in price , you can not miss .
this is a network &<HASHTAG> ; hub&<HASHTAG> ; , not to be confused with a network &<HASHTAG> ; switch&<HASHTAG> ;
a switch and a hub basically do the same thing , except a hub sends all traffic through every port whereas a switch is more intelligent and only sends traffic to the port that is required to reach the intended destination
therefore , a switch almost always provides better performance
a switch is probably what you actually want
this hub does exactly what it is supposed to
every connected device can see the network packets sent by every other connected device , which allows you to analyze the packets if you so choose .
this is a great hub
work well
this is part of my first network that i installed myself
i used all netgear compnents and i am pleased with the simplicity of the installation
just plug and go
i do recommend the netgear fa310tx nic is also .
i got this hub in the mail , plugged in the power , plugged it in to my dsl modem , plugged by pc and laptop into it , and everything just worked ! no configuration or anything ( despite my dsl setup ) , basically no problems of any kind
can not beat that !
these days , there is almost never a reason to buy a hub
for most applications , everyone should be buying a switch
i just bought for of these for our lab , because nothing beats a hub for allowing you to sniff network traffic when debugging network software
for someone wanting a real hub , the ds104 is a real hub !
i needed another ethernet hub for a software development project i am working on
hubs are difficult to find these days as low cost network switches are a dime a dozen , and provide isolation between network ports
but for network hardware development you do not want this isolation when you are trying to monitor network traffic between devices
that is where an ethernet hub comes in
yes you can use "managed" network switches but those are more expensive than the garden variety network switch
this hub was available at a fair price , and works fine
if i need another one i would purchase again .
while i have never really found huge differences in hubs based on the name brand , i have generally been very happy with this netgear hub and my new netgear router
it is built very solid ( which is not true of all hubs ) and seems to stand up well to some heavy use
( i will sometimes have to take it into work and i move it around frequently when i rearrange my office
so it gets more `mileage' than most hubs ! ) the one weakness i have found with netgear is the tech support
their web site is not the most site and it can be a bit of an effort to find a driver or anything
but it is all there and you can get pdf copies of the manuals and such , so that is helpful
the one time i have had to contact netgear phone support ( related to a wireless network card ) it was not impressive at all
but for this hub , you should have no need for tech support and it is an excellent hub .
i bought this hub to connect the computers in my home so they could share a cable modem
i looked at a lot of hubs , and found this one to be among the least expensive with the best satisfaction ratings
i am especially impressed with the hub is small size and metal case -- other hubs are larger and have plastic cases
to me , the best recommendation for a piece of network hardware is that you never have to think about it , it just works
this hub gives me that in spades .
our office used to use a handful of the hubs and some of the ( the version of the same product )
as <NUM> mbps hubs go , the is are really nice
the quality of netgear equipment has always impressed me : - nice sturdy metal construction instead of plastic
- status indicators built into the jacks , so you can easily tell which cable is connected and is active
- barrel power connector which reduce the likelihood of disconnecting power accidentally
- with an switch , port <NUM> toggles between station mode and uplink mode
unlike some hubs where two jacks are wired together , this design prevents accidentally shorting a station to an uplink
- notches on the underside allows for easy attachment to the wall , underside of a counter , etc
if you want to set up a network without spending much , these hubs work well
however , i suggest you buy a 10/100 mbps hub instead
here is why : practically all new networkable devices today support <NUM> mbps ( fastethernet ) as well as <NUM> mbps ( ethernet )
the hub ( and other <NUM> mbps hubs ) will limit you to the slower speed
as 10/100 mbps hubs are readily available today , and are quite affordable , i think your money is better spent on the faster hub
is there a noticeable difference between <NUM> mbps and <NUM> mbps ? it depends on your usage , but if you regularly work with files larger than about <NUM> kbytes or larger , you will notice a tangible difference
for truly large files ( like graphics/movies , or when installing an application via a network drive ) , a <NUM> second transfer at <NUM> mbps will take well over a minute at <NUM> mbps
if the netgear 10/100 hub ( ) is a bit too pricey for you , you might consider the linksys efah05w 10/100 hub
though not as &quot ; nice&quot ; as netgear equipment , the linksys 10/100 hub is only a few dollars more than this netgear <NUM> mbps hub .
my cable modem makes for great , fast internet access
for one computer
but what about downloading updates for my ibook without disconnecting my imac ? this hub has done that with ease
easy to follow instructions had my home network up and running within ten minutes
never a problem since .
for just a simple <NUM> mbps hub , this is an excellent one for the price
it is compact and sturdy , especially with the metal casing
link and status lights are handy along with the normal/uplink switch
no software installation needed - plug the power in and the cat cables and you are all set !
a great hub that allows you to share an uplink onto another network with <NUM> computers or have a local network of <NUM> computers
either way , the hub has been very reliable and performance has been as promised
netgear is known for making quality ethernet products and this is just another one of them .
i have bought two of these for home and office use
they work flawlessy and for the price you cannot beat the functionality
i was running at least windows <NUM> on all computers i hooked up to the ethernet hub
windows makes it easy to set up file and printer sharing
after you are hooked up to a network you will not need to swap disks all the time in order to exchange information or to move files for printing
you can transfer a hundred megabytes in a minute or two depending on the kinds of files
setup is a breeze if you have ethernet cards installed already
even if you do not have cards installed already there are instructions to walk you through step by step .
this sturdy case has outlasted many cameras and i find it adequate for carrying my camera around .
i have the kodak dc <NUM> camera - and this carry case is perfect for it
this case is compact - but yet large enough to take everything along that i need : extra batteries , pc cables , the camera is manual and cd disk , and a kodak aa battery charger
it works so well with the dc 3400 , it is almost as if it was made for it
good case for the money
to see if this case is right for you , compare your digital camera is dimensions to kodak is dc 3400
if the cameras are similar in size , you are all set .
this case is the perfect size for the and accessories ( case is approx 7&quot ; tall x 3
5&quot ; wide x 3&quot ; deep )
the main pouch is well padded and made of soft material
the bottom is reinforced to resist wear
inside the front zippered pocket , there is a mesh pocket for memory cards , as well as an divided elastic band meant for <NUM> aa batteries
inside the flap of the front pocket there is a zippered mesh pouch , which runs the entire legnth of the flap ( approx
6&quot ; x3&quot ; ) , for extra accessories
the only thing i dislike is the velcro on the main flap is a bit weak , and seems to come open without much force
i would have rather seen a zipper to keep the main pouch closed
other than that , this is a fantastic case , and i recommend it .
i bought this for a kodak dc280 , and it was ok to use
i guess that i realized ithat i wanted a larger style bag , though this one worked if i just wanted to bring along the camera and an extra memory card
i was never thrilled with it , and then i purchased a new camera ( canon g1 ) that did not fit in this case
that was when i realized how good life could be with a larger bag
if you want a small case to just carry your camera and a few very small accessories ( 4 aa batteris and a memory card or two ) , then this might be the one for you
but it wasn not the right one for me .
this is the best camera bag i have purchased , especially since it has the quality of any other case logic product , superb ! i own an old toshiba pdrm1 digital camera , and in this neat little bag , there is a protected pouch for the camera , two storage areas for digital media , and a storage for ( or aaa ) batteries
i think this bag is super convenient , since i can carry my extra smartmedia cards and spare batteries
the size of the bag is small enough to fit in my travel bag , but yet , has a lot of storage space for all the necessities of a digital camera
i highly recommend for a small digital camera like my toshiba pdrm1
dimensions of my camera : /4&quot ; long by /4&quot ; high by /2&quot ; deep
this camera is a perfect fit for this particular bag .
i bought this bag to use with my olympus
based on what other reviewers wrote , i expected the bag the bag to be more compact than it is ( i could fit two of my cameras in there )
construction and compartments are excellent , and it is a great bag if you have a few accessories to carry .
alright , it is just a bag , but it is a great bag for the olympus 3000
it has room for everything i need for the camera
the camera itself , battery charger , an extra set of batteries , a couple of extra media cards , the accessory cords for downloading
all this fits into the bag very securely , without everything banging into each other , because of the pocket dividers
the bag is not too bulky , rather compact with padding
the zippers function very well
the pockets designed such that i don not have to worry about things falling out
overall , a very good bag to take along with the camera and recharging supplies .
received this bag to go along with my olympus
it is quite a nice bag , relatively compact and easily fits my with plenty of protection offereed by the walls of the case and padded divider
there is plenty of room left for cables , a flash or even another camera if you have got one
a mesh pouch on the inside of the main compartment flap offers a handy place to store my sm cards
on the other side , another component offers <NUM> elastic loops for batteries , and <NUM> mesh pouches ( 1 zippered ) for storing more batteries or whatever else you might have
i can easily store <NUM> sets of <NUM> aa batteries in here , with plenty of room for more sm cards
and to top it all off , a zippered side pouch for another place to put stuff ( nothing too thick though )
there is an adjustable carry strap that you can use to sling over your shoulder , plus handles on the top and side , so there are plenty of ways to grab onto the bag
the only think i don not like about this bag is that mine doesn not seem to want to stand up
it always ends up rolling over onto its back
this however is a pretty minor thing .
and its rain resistant ( got stuck in the rain at practice a few times ) , padded for drop protection and fits a boatload of stuff
got my gamboy on one side and my digicam on the other
aa batteries in the secret compartment , and money and stuff on the outside .
i own the kodak dc3400 digital camera , and can not say enough about this case
it has room for my battery charger , extra set of batteries , all pc cables , kodak is software cd , and the manual that came with my camera
if your digital camera is similar in size to kodak is dc3400 , get this bag
it is simply the best balance , between compact size - and having enough room for all your accessories .
the case logic dc70 digital camera and accessory bag is great for olympus , , and the hp c315 xi and a couple of other hp and olympus models
however it is not big enough to room the sony mavicas
so dont bother getting this for those
i do have a problem with this bag and that is that it seems like the accessories on there are really stuffed onces your camera is placed inside it
because the camera comes with the usb cable and the tv connection cable and it is hard to pack all of them in here with the camera without stuffing them in
there is place for a battery recharger in there and a set of batteries along with the compact flash cards
overall this case is pretty decent although you have got to be careful not to let the case swing about from your arm and hit a wall or something
there are other websites selling this a little cheaper .
i ordered two and they came in the standard distribution box that stood up to thefreight carrier
inside the carton was the two seperate retail sales boxes in premium shape
units worked right out of the box once batteries were connected
powerchute cd was original older version and the web had the updated 3
0 ( 2012 )
stable angled plug with a very sturdy cord .
i have owned five of these ups units over the past four years
i purchased three for my mac and pc at home
then i had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit
currently only one still works ! i have very infrequent power outages , perhaps three in the past four years
these units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down
my g5 mac was so power hungry that i had to use one for the computer and another for the <NUM> inch lcd
i can not comment on other ups brands such as belkin , but i have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores
there seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished apc products but this may be a reflection of apc is popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand
my experience over the past four years has been mixed
these are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes
if you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear
i chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms
many users do not have that flexibility so a ups is essential insurance
the units i puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years
i can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years ; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until i bought new batteries
prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor
battery life depends on many factors so i don not begrudge apc for wear and tear on the battery but to have <NUM> out of <NUM> units simply stop working is unacceptable
i bought apc branded batteries and can not explain why the recurrent failures
i am frustated with my apc products but it may be a problem with this model
just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an ups !
had mine since december <NUM> but noticed that the battery failed after about <NUM> years , like the other poster wrote , apc didn not list a replacement at first but now they do and i finally got around to replacing it
battery type is rbc2 for those wondering
solid unit , having a telephone line/out and usb controller is a plus .
i have owned one of these ups is for about <NUM> years
earlier this year the alarms went off indicating that the battery needed replacement
i thought that was odd considering the age of the unit
no problem though , i will just log onto apc is website and order a replacement battery
wasn not i surprised to see that apc indicates that this model doesn not have a replacable battery
this didn not make much sense to me since the unit has an access door to the battery compartment
well , i removed the battery and found a web vendor that had a replacement for $18
it is a very common 12volt cell and was available from several vendors
the unit is back up and working well again
i have experienced several in the past few years and this ups can keep my cpu , 19" monitor , cable modem & network switch operable for enough time to save any work in progress and shut down my system
in closing , it is a well designed unit with adequate power for most home or small office systems
but i was a little put off by the short life of the original battery and incorrect replacement information listed by apc .
i have had three of these units for the past years ( one for my pc , one for the wife is and one for the tivo & cable box )
we have relatively unreliable power here with it going off an average of once a month -- usually for seconds at a time but occasionally for hours
anyway these units have kept our stuff safe and running
however they don not last too long on battery power
just long enough for short power outages or long enough to shut things down
the batteries wore out after about years so i replaced them using batteries from a web vendor
now the first battery of this second round has failed so i am buying another round of three batteries
hopefully these units will last many more years .
this sound card doesn not reproduce mp3 or wav files any differently than a more expensive card would
creative labs has always made great cards and drivers
the only thing this card doesn not give you that the more expensive card do is the 3d sound effects when playing video games , and true dolby 5
1 for dvd playback
however , i doubt many people are setup for this situation , and many people do not watch dvd is or play games
if this is you , this card is perfect for you
if you are a gamer then this card will work perfectly fine
i personally find the 3d effects annoying , and prefer to play on a card like this
i highly recomend this card .
i keep a lot of computer equipment at home , due to the fact that i am an a+ technician working to complete my mcse ( microsoft certified systems engineer ) credentials
i bought a computer from ebay last month in order to practice setting up computer networks at home
this particular computer is a desktop , designed more for the office environment rather than the typical entertainment pc that we would normally have at home
i decided to add dvd capability to this system , in order to enjoy a movie at my work desk whenever the mood strikes me to take a break from work ( which happens quite frequently )
i added a sony dvd player , this particular soundblaster soundcard , and a pair of cambridge soundworks speakers
within thirty minutes , i was watching the lord of rings
now , about the soundblaster
this is a very good soundcard for its intended purpose
which is to provide basic sound functionality to a desktop computer
the sound quality is good enough to enjoy listening to stereo sounds from music cds and dvds
but please , do not expect this card to provide you with surround sound quality
this is definitely the wrong price range if you need that kind of quality
i compared the sound quality of this office system to my primary home system
my home system is a dell dimension 8200 , with a turtle beach soundcard and the altec lansing surround system
i switched the mode of operation of the altec lansings from surround to stereo for comparison purposes between the two systems
subjectively , you can definitely tell the difference between the two
i can recommend this soundblaster to anyone who is simply looking to add stereo sound to his or her desktop computer
it is inexpensive and easy to install
it will require the use of one of your pci slots
for your information , i installed this card on an ibm 300pl desktop pc
the system has a pentium iii processor and <NUM> mb of ram
it is running an evaluation copy of windows <NUM> advanced server
the dvd player is a sony ddu1621 and the monitor is a kds <NUM> inch flat screen crt
if you are interested , i wrote reviews on the kds monitor and the sony dvd player , here at amazon .
i have owned other sound blaster sound cards
i have found creative labs to be the best in the sound card industry
this sound card is to replace and older model
so for , the sound blaster card is functioning well
i always consider creative labs sound cards for all of my sound needs .
i installed per instructions , beign always grounded with a wrist strap wired to live ground circuit
when i turned on the computer it went crazy and burned out the motherboard
took it to local tech who said newly installed board was bad and caused the motherboard to short out
ruined computer !
this is a basic sound card
nothing fancy
the thing that seperates it from the rest is that creative is a huge company and has drivers available for all windows ( the linux/bsd world probably supports this thing , i haven not checked )
this is as close to plug and play as you can get
that guy who ranted about this card crashing his system needs to buy a clue and check his irqs , not to mention dump windows me ( which *microsoft* doesn not even stand by ) .
essentially , this is the , audio creative labs sound card
it has a mock '3d' stereo effect , a midi wavetable , and it can sample at up to 48khz in stereo , and that is about all there is to it
whilst it doesn not do anything wrong in itself ( it is , so if you are using windows it should work out of the box ) , the soundblaster live isn not much more expensive , and offers environmental audio
if you only dabble with music and don not play many new games it is a perfectly adequate solution , however .
this is a basic sound card
it puts out pretty good sound for most things you do on your computer
it comes with some ok software and all the cables to connect to your drive so you can rip your cds directly from the
the drivers are included for all windows including xp
why you wouldn not want this cardif you are a gamer or listen to high quality mp3 ( over <NUM> bitrate ) , <NUM> or less will sound fine with this cardi don not understand people having driver support because creative labs is the biggest sound card company on the market and one thing you will not have to worry about is driver support with any current or future versions of windows
these binoculars are super nice
they really get you close to the action , and the effect is terrific
detail and sharpness are very good as well
if you wear glasses , you are better off removing them
if you leave your glasses on it just doesn not work very well
on the other hand , you are allowed to adjust each eyepiece separate if you are like me and don not see 20/20
however , there is a trick to it because you can only adjust individual focus on the right eyepiece
so you cover the right eyepiece and focus the binoculars , then cover the left side to the focus for your right eye
i found it a bit , and think it would be better if you could separately adjust the focus on each side
even so , once you have it dialed in , there are marks on the frame and the eyepiece that you can use as reference for when it gets borrowed or changed inadvertently
my biggest issue with these binoculars is that they won not focus in close enough
the target has to be close to 100' away
since they are binoculars , that is probably ok for most uses
but i spend a lot of time watching birds 20' from my window
now i am going to have to buy another pair for that purpose
they are also heavy
expect to put them down often to rest
that is probably normal for binoculars this powerful
when my wife first used them , she was shocked at how large objects were .
i was actually pretty excited to get these , but when it arrived , it was defective
the monoculars didn not align , causing me to see double and <NUM> picture , not as one
also , there seemed to be a scratch of some sort on the right monocular
i tried to clean or blow it out to see if it was just an eye lash , but it never went away
i sent them back for a return .
i was really looking forward to getting these binoculars
i had owned bushnell binoculars in the past and was very happy with them
these arrived totally broken
the left main lens housing was sheared completely off from the unit
looking at them , i found they were constructed using cheap plastic for the main body
the lens housings are screwed into the body , but the plastic is so fragile that apparently when they were dropped sometime during the shipping process the plastic shattered
i probably could have the housing back on but then they would have been subject to fogging since when the housing broke off the nitrogen that is injected into the housing escaped
nitrogen is used to prevent the lenses from fogging
while checking out the remainder of the unit , i worked with the quick focus lever and found that it didn not hold focus very well either
i would like to see a unit that has a dial focus with a lever fine focus so that the major focus point is stable
the lever focus would be really nice for finer focusing after you have zeroed in on the subject
i would have used them for viewing auto racing for the most part , so once you get the major focus point clear , a lever focus for fine focusing would be great for viewing a moving target like race cars that can vary in distance by up to 1/4 of a mile closer or further than the main focus point as the cars travel around the track
that is where the quick focus lever could do a great job
but to use it for the entire focus field is too much and it isn not fine enough since a tiny bump in the wrong direction can cause you to lose sight of your target object entirely
i also agree that the design of the focus bar is poor in that you have to use both hands to focus since you can only push down
either that or if you have a long finger you can reach across the center and push down on the other side of the bar as well
i won not be reordering a replacement
instead i will look for binoculars that have a more durable housing since using binoculars subjects them to being "knocked around" and if the material used by bushnell shatters so easily , they are not going to last very long
so my advice to anyone who owns these particular binoculars is to protect them from being dropped or even bumped into trees , etc very hard since the housing is brittle and will shatter
if you use them in winter , they will be even more brittle and the housing will shatter even more easily than in warm weather like we have now
i would also advise bushnell to change their packaging since if they make a product that is this fragile they should pack it in thicker shock absorbing materials than they currently do since what they use wouldn not protect a product a fraction of the weight and bulk of this product
that would lessen the chance of catastrophic damage such as these were obviously subjected to
my cell phone , which weighs 3
5 ounces came in a corrugated box with a total weight of one pound with <NUM> ounces of that being the box and packing materials ( the charger weighs about <NUM> oz )
yet these binoculars that weigh <NUM> times as much as my cell phone , with optics that are far more vulnerable to damage from the shocks of shipping and handling than a cell phone have only a couple of ounces of material to protect them from damage and came in a box no sturdier than a cereal box
it is a miracle if any of these binoculars get to the customer in one piece !
this is a good binoculars
it is clear and light
buy it only if you really need 16x magnification
at times , you will wish you didn not have so much of magnification
my next binoculars will be one with zoom ! the carrying case is ( so is the neck strap ) .
bought this in <NUM> and it going great
16x50 is on the higher end and i would recommend a smaller one because slight shake in the hand makes the objet move a lot , otherwise eit is good .
love the binoculars just like everyone else
only complaint is the flimsy attachments
the neck strap is impossible to attach and is obviously a piece of junk anyway so don not bother
i find it annoying that the lens covers aren not connected in some way
they pop off very easily
just seems to me like something that could easily be prevented with better design
all things considered , these are really minor complaints
the purpose is to get great binoculars for a great price , and that i did
i would still highly recommend them .
they aren not as advertised
they don not fold together enough to get a single vision through both lenses , so one always sees double
i had several friends try them and they all said the same thing , so it isn not just me
with a name brand like bushnell i thought i couldn not go wrong , but apparently their quality control is
i ordered these while traveling out west and couldn not send them back until i got home
i tried to return them , but amazon said the last return date was one day before , so i am stuck with these useless binoculars
i need to find someone whose eyes are really far apart and give them to them .
i purchased these with the intent of using for bird watching but they literally make me feel dizzy and green
no matter what i try , they just don not seem to provide a clear , distinct view
seem abnormally darker than others i have used and never give a crisp clear view
on the other hand , they are by far more ergonomic than the old ones i owned , feel great , solid , nice set
but wish i'd kept my <NUM> year old set instead
not good for bird watching
can not begin to imagine for sports
perhaps its my eyes ? unsure but they don not compare to <NUM> year old set .
when you are getting a pair of 16x50 binoculars at this , it would probably be harsh of me to criticize them too hard , so long as i can see through them effectively : - ) they are heavy - but that is what i expected , so no complaints there
the strap that comes with these is made of nasty thick plastic - a kind of strap that i haven not seen since i got a cheap slr in the early 1980s
completely pointless ( unusable in my opinion ) , and the first thing i would advise is to go buy the strap/support system of your choice and don not relay on the nasty accessory that comes with
the binoculars come with lens caps on
i haven not figure out if they intend you to use them all the time to protect the lenses , or if they are just for show in the box
the large caps are fine , but the small ones do not stay attached , so don not rely on them to protect
in use , the quick focus mechanism is actually very effective but definitely requires two hands to operate as it is a little stiff ( and as a lever , you have to be able to press down on either side )
i guess few people would be operating something this heavy with one hand , but it does mean that both hands are under tension as you have to have fingers on the focus mechanism
optically , these are absolutely built to the price
definite chromatic aberration here giving a nice blue/yellow fringe , especially at longer distances
but for the price , i kind of expected that
diopter correction works well
overall , a great product for the price
i would possibly recommend looking at spending a little more to get some better optics , but really for this money it is a great way to get this much magnification .
binoculars are very powerful
the focus is simple and accurate
very pleased with the binocs and the price was terrific .
they work and for the price i cant complain to much
the construction of the unit is almost all plastic and the ocular bridge flexes when you put any pressure on it
though its nice to have a set of bino is that don not break the bank if one of the young ones drops/damages/loses them
at 16x they can be little shaky off hand but i use this set primarily for spotting during rim fire shooting games and these binoculars make seeing
22lr bullet holes at 50yds very easy to see and score .
got these so i could use them for hunting and other spotting , little bulky , but good distance
comes with everything you need .
the actual dimnetions of this product are 7" long and 7" wide ( at the end of the product- the part that we hold to our eyes is not quite as wide and fit to the eyes
these are very strong binoculars , they are 16x the magnification , the <NUM> ( the other # ) is simply the size of the front lens
its <NUM> mm in diameter ( wide )
they are very strong and you can see things very far away
if you need a pair for a concert or a football game or something , then i believe these would be way to powerful and large
( also i read somewhere , and i think its true that anything over 10x the magnification ( these are 16x ) that you should use a tripod , since its too hard to see properly , since it needs to be completely still .
good product for the price i buyed for a gift , the owner says to love it .
i purchased this binocs for a tiger safari in india and am amazed by the quality of this product
certainly recommended and a great value for price
aaaaaaa plus quality .
i bought this item to go nature viewing and must say that it really is a great binocular for the price
the items viewed have a really nice look to them and the diopter comes in handy even for someone with very bad vision like myself
the focus for this model ( 16 x <NUM> wide angle ) is a flat tab between the barrels that makes it very convenient to use without having to look or stretch your fingers
it gives a very nice field of vision and has roll down eye cups , which is good just in case you want to wear your glasses or shades
the binoculars do shake a little b/c of the power of the magnification
and it can be a chore to hold for long periods of time b/c of its weight
it weighs about as much as one of michener is hardback novels
here is where it can get interesting
the binoculars come with a pleather carrying case , a really cheap neck strap that looks like a plastic shoelace , and a cheap cleaning cloth that is way too abrasive to be used everyday
i suggest replacing both the neck strap and cleaning cloth as soon as you can
the soft , microfiber cloths they sell in eyeglass stores works great
plus , pick up some of the eyeglass cleaner ( spray directly onto cloth , not lens ) as it really gets the lens clean and protects any coating on the glass
tripod use : highly recommended to get a steady picture
you can get a regular camera tripod for around <NUM> dollars
yes , this binocular comes with a tripod adapter
no , it is not very easy to find
&lt ; g&gt ; the instruction booklet is virtually useless , but i found out through the website that the adaptor is located behind the front cap between the barrels
just screw the cap off and viola , there is your threaded coupler
you will still need to get a binocular adaptor to connect the binoculars to the tripod , but i have found that they aren not too expensive : around dollars for the generic models
i gave this item <NUM> stars b/c of the poorly written instruction manual and cheap accessories
hope some of this info helps
can not wait to see the stars tonight !
i gave it only <NUM> stars because the focus is just a marketing gimmick that creates a cheap focusing mechanism
a decent traditional wheel for focusing is superior
you can not easily get a good focus , pressing your eyes against the eyepiece can force them out of focus , and it is easy to bump the rocker bar
at 16x power , you have to carefully adjust focus and a rocker bar is an awful design
you have to use both hands to focus : you can press down on one side of the rocker bar , but not up , so to go in and out of focus to get good sharpness , you have to press down with one hand is finger and then press down with the other hand is finger
the rocker bar is terrible idea , especially for 16x ! to make matter is worse , there is a fair amount of play in the rocker bar
the rocker bar seems to be the limiting factor on short distances
<NUM> feet seemed to be the shortest distance they would focus
stars come into focus well before the limit of the focus is reached , possibly indicating questionable workmanship , or maybe it makes it better for those who are
the moons of jupiter were clear and sharp even under city lights
since it was the brightest "star" in the sky i thuoght i was looking at venus , but when i saw the <NUM> sharp dots surrounding the round disk , i knew it had to be jupiter
you have to rest them on a chair to see the moons
the price here at amazon ( with free shipping ) is $20 less than my local walmart after our <PERCENT> taxes
16x requires a fence or car or window to provide the stability needed to make full use of 16x
even without a prop , it is good , but if your not going to use a prop , 12x50 is better because the amount of light is greater and the field of view is larger .
these are decent binoculars
they are rubber armored and seem fairly sturdy
i live on the 9th floor near the beach
these are great for watching moving boats and jetskis go by through my living room window
they are good for a quick look at something , but difficult to hold steady for more than <NUM> seconds
i guess that is the same for all 16x binoculars
they work better with a tripod mount and a tripod
these are probably easier to hold steady than 20x50 is
the zip focus is handy
the focus at 16x magnification is more critical than 8x or 10x binoculars
i find myself very frequently
kind of a pain after using my other bushnell 8x25 permafocus binoculars , which never need to be refocused
i got these for stargazing
they don not work as well as expected for that purpose
first , the bak7 prisms don not transmit light as well as bak4 prisms
second , the 50mm objective lens is not large enough for 16x magnification at night
i also own a pair of pentax whitetails 10x50 is which are much better for stargazing
the whitetails are much easier to hold steady and the image is much brighter at night
the whitetails are slightly heavier though
the celestron 15x70 is are probably a better choice for stargazing if you want high magnification
i thought about returning the bushnell 16x50 is because they aren not so good at night
i gave them a second chance today and decided to keep them for daytime use
not bad as a spare pair to have around with higher magnification than 8x or 10x , but i don not recommend them as your first or only pair of binoculars though
as for magnification , 7x and 8x binos are fairly easy to hold steady
10x approaches the limit of steadyness for handheld use
i used to have a pair of tasco 12x50 is and tried to use them for stargazing
i had to prop my elbows on a car hood to use them
even then , they were not very steady
i loaned them to a friend for a football game once , and i never saw them again
no great loss really
16x is really pushing the limit for shakeyness
there is no way i'd buy 20x binoculars for handheld use
8x seems to be the best compromise between steadyness and magnification
for stargazing , many authors recommend 7x50 binoculars
personally , i don not think 7x magnification is good enough
you will want something with higher magnification after trying them
you can not really go wrong with a pair of 10x50 is for stargazing , like the 'pentax' whitetails i mentioned before
the 10x50 is might even be cheaper for the same optical quality as 7x50 is
a pair of 8x56 is or 9x63 is would be good for stargazing too , but the 10x50 is are more bang for the buck
if you have never owned a pair of binoculars before , and you want some good ones for daytime use , you can not really go wrong with a good pair of 8x40 is
i like the 8x40 is better than 7x35 is , because 7x is not high enough magnification
the price difference between 7x35 and 8x40 isn not that much .
i read other review , and decided to give it a try
as soon as i recieve it in the mail , and opened the box , i realized this was a mistake
cheap quality binocular with "high power" being a selling point
it came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart
you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place ! it is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation
you will be constantly ajdusting the focus
your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it
indeed strap , case , lense protectors are all cheap crap , and annoying to have it all on~ ! i am taking this back , and buying made in japan "nikon eagle view" <NUM> times better
you get what you pay for~ !
the pair of 16x50 bushnell powerview binoculars i received were defective from the start , with serious double vision and unequal focus between eyes ( despite diopter adjustment ) , so i can not comment on their optic quality
i did test each barrel separately and thought the 16x50 view was big , bright and clear
although it seemed neither side focused real shapely , that may have been from the defect ( s ) my pair came with
currently ( 3/2014 ) the listing for these 16x50 binoculars says roof prism for some reason ? i tested my 16x50 is on a sunny day
tho they are high power ( 16 ) for the objective lens diameter ( 50 ) , the exit pupil size gave me no trouble
it may have been in double vision but it was easy to get the full view , at least on a bright day
there are complaints in the reviews about the lever focus mechanism , versus a focus wheel
the little that i used the binoculars , i didn not have a problem with the lever focus
in fact , focusing by rocking the lever with a finger on each side was kind of nice
the lever mechanism seems like a promising idea but apparently whether bushnell executed it effectively is in question
and i suppose it is possible the lever mechanism had something to do with the unequal focus between barrels and apparent but given my pair is other huge problems , it was impossible to tell
the reviews complaining of the interpupillary adjustment are
i am male of average height
my eyes aren not particularly close together but my binoculars at their narrowest interpupillary distance were barely narrow enough for me
i have never before had that trouble with binoculars
these binoculars would be useless for lots and lots of people
otherwise the binoculars seemed solid and durable
my main problem wasn not with the binoculars but with amazon warehouse deals , where i bought them
there is no reason binoculars this defective should have been relisted and sold to me
it is plain bad business and bad customer service
anyone considering buying binoculars from warehouse deals should do it with eyes wide open for lemons
luckily they are pretty easy about returns and letting you try again
a keeper arrives eventually
of course i will return them
i am ambivalent about trying another pair of 16x50 powerviews
the complaints about the focus lever and interpupillary adjustment had me on the fence to begin with
then i get this pair that is so miserably
it might be a fluke or it might be the powerview design ? if you are looking at powerviews , consider bushnell h2o ; i have a pair of 8x42 h2o is
for about the same price the h2o is are waterproof & more solid and come with a wheel focus and better , rather than , eyecups
however , h2o is don not have the attractive selection of high powers and big objectives .
i do not know if my experience was the same for those that had an awfull time installing this modem
but after force install i was online all in all about minutes , sure that should not be the case especially now days coming from a well known brand such as this ( was ) , install should have been minutes
first out of the box , the install disk failed , error something about corrupt or missing driver
that seemd ok the instructions warned of a possible system patched needed , ok so did the patch , same error
missing or corrupt file
hmmm i wonder how many bad install disks are floating arouund aggrevating people
this is really a great stable fast modem , feel bad for those that gave up on the install
anyways , first i had to figure out what driver on the disk belongs with my modem , after a few trial and error and educated guess i identifieds the installation driver directly on the disk and manually loaded the drivers
but thats not the end of this story
for some reason the pci card barely fit into the case , the aligment was off and could barely fit
i did manage to get everything seated but it was difficult , the plate needs to come in a 8th of and inch , perhaps even a quarter
my install was in a dell dimension tower , win98se , the old usrobotics finnaly caved in after years of slowly dying
modem connect fast and realatively seems to work pretty fast as far as browsing web pages , almost comparable to low speed dsl , really seems that good
connection consistantly made at 45k , which is very exceptable , the old usr when new pegged 52k alot , and i was impressed , but eventually that card died after <NUM> years
i have an old mot 56k about <NUM> years and still runs very well
3 stars , aggrevating installation , bad disk etc
, and bad manufacturing , the alignment was difficult to seat properly , very tight fit
after those hurdles , runs very well
no matter what make sure you get the modem that is harware based not software driven ! there are two version of the diamond supramax modem make sure it is the correct one ! look for the pro model , it has the on board "dsp" chip
hardware based
if having difficulty install the supramax pro version , look for the "pciproa" on the disk
otherwise for the version use the multiple install disk folders that are next to the "
proa" .
i purchased this modem for my folks pc and it works great
they are running win98se on an 800mhtz athlon with <NUM> mb ram
this brings me to a point i think is important
some reviewers ( running win2k or winxp ) left negative reviews for this item because it didn not work with their computers
my advice is to know your computer before you buy any hardware for it
you should know what operating system you are running ( and its version ) and your hardware configuration ( at least your cpu speed , ram and hard drive space )
if you are using windows , on "my computer" and selecting "properties" will give you most of the info you need
so will "system information" in the "system tools" folder
it is a simple rule and will save you a great deal of time and trouble in the long run .
the modem installed and was configured in about <NUM> minutes from start to finish
direct is a good supplier .
the best modem i have seen so far
way better the usrobotics/3com modems
i have two and they work very nicely
it is the next modem i'de buy if i needed another one .
this modem is the most economical one that i have ever purchased
under windows 98 , it ran at 48k
but in my case i had to enable the pci slot through the bios
my pci slots were disabled by default by the phoenix bios
i have a dec
i tried to install it under windows nt4
0 ( sp6 ) but to no avail
even though service was excellent , the modem exhibited no response after installation
i was advised to reinstall nt4
0 and the service pack , but my system crashed
with a us robotics internal faxmodem , i got 51k in windows 98
the difference is not significant , but the price was
in general , i highly recommend this economical and fast modem under windows 98 .
i picked up my modem and installed it in just a couple of minutes
it was easy
when i log on , it seems to connect at <NUM> every time
i guess that is good because my 33
6 connected at 31
i was going to buy that $25 one with the $20
rebate but from the reviews - you get what you pay for
i went with diamond and i am glad i did
the box says the requirements are for a pentium <NUM> or higher
i have a pentium <NUM> and it has worked great .
like other people have said before me , this modem won not break through the 50kbs barrier
my external xircom [serial port] modem could connect at <NUM> kbs on the same line
( the effective difference between <NUM> kbs and <NUM> kbs is negligible though , so who cares ) the drivers for this modem loaded easily the first time , and when i win2000 , they automatially , no questions asked
on a side note : this modem supports the rare 3
3 volt standard
( some workstations and servers use the 3
3 volt standard , but everyone else uses the <NUM> volt standard- so this doesn not matter for most people
<NUM> volts is an &quot ; emerging&quot ; standard which will probably never catch on )
most pci modems only fit into <NUM> volt pci slots
a 3
3 volt pci card slot has different gooves so that you can not mistakenly put a <NUM> volt card into it
the supramax is compatable with both
( silicon graphics pointed me towards the supramax after i struck out with another modem )
closing comments : this modem has served me well , but now it collects dust inside my computer , thanks to my cable modem
it is still nice to know that it is there for me , and i use it occasionally to test how long my sites take to load for the [] people
this rio model is a nifty music device
compact size , fantastic sound quality , no skipping , and easy transfer of music from a computer
on the other hand , it only holds six or seven songs , the door on the battery case doesn not stay shut so well after a few months of use , and a little abuse , and the &quot ; hold&quot ; switch gets sticky after a while and becomes difficult to move
if you can find it on the cheap it is a cool toy , otherwise wait for a newer model or get some other technology to fire up your tunes .
the rio rocks ! it is so great that diamond multimedia prevailed in their fight against the forces of pure evil in the music industry and allowed us , the public , to have the rio ! this little baby holds your mp3 is and plays them with outrageous quality and no moving parts ! you simply cannot make the music &quot ; skip&quot ;
take it jogging , bob sledding , whatever ! the rio is cute and compact , battery lasts forever , runs great and is really simple to use
works well with the pc linkup , etc
a hot item !
i own a 300se and aside from the fact that it has updated firmware and more memory it is exactly the same
i was worried about things that i had read stating that the case was shoddy , the volume level was insufficient and the memory didn not hold enough
i just wanted to say that all of this is not true
it seems really solid to me , not that i'd ever drop the thing or be rough with it , but it does just fine while jogging or riding a bike
as for the volume level comments perhaps people are just listening to songs encoded at a low base level because i listen to mine on level <NUM> of <NUM> and it is fine for most songs unless i am in a really noisy environment
lastly i listen to all of my songs at 128k
and i can fit an acceptable amount of music on my 64megs--no it isn not as much as a cd but with <NUM> 32meg smartmedia cards on the way that should be more than enough to get me through all but the longest of plane flights
with the portability of the transfer cable and software i can just burn all of my mp3s to a cd or 2 , throw it in my luggage and change the songs out from wherever i happen to be
much more efficient than lugging around all of my cdr mixes and other cds
true the parallel transfer is much slower than the usb that the <NUM> offers , but do i really want to use usb when places that i travel might not offer usb support ? also the backlight of the new 500s are supposed to drain the battery power and i don not find the lack of a backlight to be as big of a problem as i thought it would be , however
i would definately recommend purchasing the rio remote as it super easy to use and extends the headphone is cord length by a good <NUM> feet
see ya !
i got my rio pmp <NUM> from my employer as a gift
it was my first exposure to mp3 , as up to that point i had been dismissing it as a fad
having the device , and about <NUM> cd is , i figured why not give it a shot
the installation of the software went smooth
i found an update , and installed that as well with no problems
then i started trying to rip and found that the included software was hardly stable
i was running on windows nt , which seemed to be supported by the manufacturer , but with some caveats
i would start ripping and the software would crash
i would try to transfer to the device and the software would crash
i would complete a transfer to the device after several tries only to find that one or more songs didn not actually make it
bottom line - the connectivity for this device was pathetic
but speaking for the device itself - i loved it
the music played cleanly , without interruption , regardless of how much i shook the device
the buttons on the front are well placed , well labeled , and nicely inset just enough so they still provide easy access , but you don not have to worry about them protruding
it has all the features you might want including random and repeat
the display let is me know how much memory i have , what track number is playing , and the time of the song
there are also various other indicators that are helpfull ( battery , etc
the memory on this device is small - 32mb
and the manufacturer says it will only support up to 64mb total with an expansion card
that expansion card can hold it is own set of music so you can swap them in and out without effecting the music on the built in memory
however , vendor chose the odd memory type of 3
3v for the external memory versus typical compactflash
there is a convenient &quot ; lock&quot ; switch on the side that keeps the buttons from registering
this can be good in two ways : it won not get turned on accidentally and burn battery , and you won not accidentally hit the stop button and interrupt your listening
the belt clip is handy , and detachable , and the battery life ( one aa ) is quite respectable
in all , i really love my rio pmp 300
it is perfect for a trip to the gym , a jog around the neighborhood , or even for a short plane flight
if all you need is an hour ( 30 mins on internal memory alone at a <NUM> sample rate ) to pass the time , then you really don not need to spend more - this is the perfect device .
unlike many of the other minidisc owners on here , i happen to like mp3
the minidisks are great
but for something small and light to tuck in my pocket , nothing beats the rio ! it is at least half the size and a third the weight of my minidisk player
and yes , the size does make a difference to many people
i love getting free mp3 is off the web , and while i *could* put them on minidisks , i like being able to every day or so put a completely different assortment of songs on the rio to listen to
it is certainly not much harder than recording a disk and i am one of those people that can listen to favorite songs over and over so a little repetition doesn not bother me any
unfortunately , the rio is not without faults
in fact , i have a hard time recommending it
<NUM> meg is definitely not enough
i got a flash card , and have started having varying problems , first with my memory being unusable , and then having small chunks become corrupted
am now having problems with the player intermittently stopping on its own and freezing up so i have to remove the battery
oh , should mention that the first rio i got had a broken battery compartment and was returned
am still waiting on my rebates
hate not being able to use it on windows nt , and not having usb
and the headsets that come with it are worthless for many people
personally , i am not sure i even want to try the later rio models , as i have had so much trouble with this one in only a few months of owning it .
for the price this is really cool , you will need to buy extra memory , but it works with free mp3 players to load
the headphones are ear type so get a real pair , otherwise this worked great
i have this unit with the <NUM> meg flash card
when i first bought the product , i was running around like a happy fool glad to be ride of my walkman bouncing around my waste on short jogs
after the honeymoon was over i started to have issues
the software that came with it , was the music match software
it was good for only a limited number of plays before expiry
i called diamond and they told me their rio port software was to come out shortly
when the software did come out i found it didn not work properly on the pmp300
i looked for some help files on &quot ; configuration / troubleshooting &quot ; but there was none
tech support told me this was a known issue the pmp300 doesn not always show up as a configurable option so reinstall the software
<NUM> reinstalls later i still couldn not get the rio port software to work , so i gave up and i just reinstall the music match software when it expires every two weeks
since then my lcd has become dim and the plastic belt handle broke
the unit is about a year old now and cost about <NUM> $ new
i really like my mp3 player but i will not buy another rio
i am looking at alternatives
put all those stupid , fluffy descriptions aside because only <NUM> words are needed to describe these speakers - they rock ! never thought i would pay so little for so much !
these speakers are extremely good
the sound is very clear , the bass sounds very natural
get them
i found them incredibly difficult to find , i searched over <NUM> sites until i finally got them
amazon totally has a monopoly going on
but anyway , bottom line , get these as soon as possible , because i remember when they were available for like $80 and when i finally found them at like the 23rd site they were $107
but they were worth it
maybe watch it if they reach like $200
but otherwise , yes .
these are not big speakers , but they have big sound
if you decide to get a pair , you have to listen to the song , &quot ; i love big speakers&quot ;
this has some good bass , that will show you what the speakers can do
awesome speakers .
because these speakers still hold up here in <NUM> against some of the newest and most expensive computer setups
i remember when these first came out and were the first set of computer speakers to ever get a "kickass" review from the computer enthusiast magazine "boot" , but i didn not buy these myself until <NUM> when they were on clearance for super cheap
kinda wish i had bought more of them when they were so cheap , since they are still pretty much the best 2
1 computer speaker setup you can possibly have
the midrange these put out is unbelievable for a speaker this size
they look a little outdated ( i have the black color so slightly less so ) , but damn do these sound i have owned and heard pretty much every "thx" certified 2
1 , 4
1 , and 5
1 computer speaker ever made .
i recently upgraded my stock hewlett packard pavillion <NUM> speakers to the yamaha ystms50w subwoofer/satellite computer speakers
first and foremost , let me tell you one thing : wow , and i really mean wow , what a great set of computer speakers ! understand : you don not get full blown surround sound with these speakers -- few pc applications necessitate this type of audio quality anyway
but unlike the higher end 5
1 and 6
1 speakers on the market today , these speakers will , out of the box , work with and optimize the performance of most stock sound cards
and this is important if you want to get superior performance at a reasonable cost
my only complaint ( and it is an exeedingly *small* one ) is that the audio controls are split between one satellite speaker ( volume and on/off ) and the sub woofer ( base volume ) -- it would be more convenient to have all audio controls on one unit ( i
on a satellite speaker )
but i can more than live with this almost negligible inconvenience to get the type of sound that these speakers deliver for the price
net/net : 1 ) awesome ( i would even say unsurpassed ) sound quality to cost ratio2 ) extremely easy ( took me less than <NUM> minutes -- and this included carrying the box up the stairs to my pc room ) 3 ) wished the connecting wires were longer ( the ones that came with my unit restrict satellite speaker placement to within <NUM> feet of the ) 4 ) needs some industrial design tweaks ( i
audio controls should all be in one place ) 5 ) rich base , sweet , and earth shaking volume for you hard rockers or gamers6 ) must have for any audiophile who is on a budget
nice headphones
no noise escapes the headphones to disturb others
got them for my daughter is keyboard
she says the only negative is that they don not have much range of volume but still great for when you want to play when others are trying to sleep or whatever .
these headphones have some nice features
they are a nice shape that fits comfortably on the head
they are a nice size that are fairly easy to carry around for headphones
they also have a very nice long cord that gives a lot of reach
the only issue i have is that they are a bit more quiet and less responsive than other headphones i have used that cost about the same
if you want a nice pair of headphones that are easy to carry around , it is tough to beat these .
they are not exactly noise cancelling as i read in some of the reviews
you can hear the tv a little and the person watching the tv can hear a little bit of the music if it is loud
it does allow for the one practicing to hear their music well
for the price i'd say it is worth it if your child is always practicing the same time you need it to be quiet or the tv is on .
this headset is inexpensive , so don not expect a product you will have for years to come
however it has good sound and the ear foam is denser than most low end product which makes it comfortable .
i purchased these headphones to go w/my electric piano and i am delighted w/them and so is my family ! now i can practice as often as i want and not bother anyone , great sound and light on the head so no headaches and great price , very affordable !
i chose this item to go with my synthesizer
it fits perfect and i can hear very clearly
it appears to provide a surround sound .
the sound is good with these headphones and i use them to watch movies and you tube
my only problem is that after awhile the ear pads start to bother my ears and i have to take them off
it would be nice if there was an adjustment not only for size , but for width
it would also be nice if there was a little padding at the top
otherwise they are good for the price and they are not big and bulky , which was why i bought them in the first place .
got this for our student to practice whiteout any hassles
decent material at the right price and it works ! thank you yamaha and amazon ! ( but i am still unhappy about needing to buy a power cord ) .
i bought this for my son to practice piano with
he doesn not like his current headphone
it is the kind that covers the ears completely , and his ears turn red and itchy from it
this one doesn not cover the ears completely , but the foam part is still much bigger than your average headphone
so i took off the piano connector part and snap it onto the plug a cheap headphone with small foam area , and my son likes that way the best
i try to give the headphone to a different son but he doesn not like the feel either
prefers the cheap ones he already has
the piano connector part snaps onto the regular headphone part tightly , plus it has an area you can grab onto so that you can pull everything out of the keyboard easily so that the piano part isn not stuck in the keyboard when you remove the headphone
so now i am using in bed to watch movies on my computer while not disturbing my husband
it feels fine to me , but i have hair covering my ears
the sound is good
and it covers the sound pretty good
when i take off the headphone , i don not hear much from it
for the price , i think this is worth it .
terrific for making adjustment in each individual eq for vocals and instruments
can help each voice , and instrument , sound better
plus it gives the vocals a better monitor mix .
these inexpensive earphones provide adequate rendering of sound from tv , movies , etc
however , in terms of comfort , they leave much to be desired
the flat , hard plastic speaker enclosure is only covered by a thin , somewhat scratchy &<HASHTAG> ; cloth&<HASHTAG> ; material
it provides inadequate cushioning of one is ears from the hard plastic of the speaker enclosures
a cotton , or even a foam covering would be an improvement .
well built good sound worth the price , can be used for short and long range applications , multiple plugs makes it versatile .
these are light and inexpensive
needed ones with this type of plug
use it with a portable keyboard
has a nice long cord
didn not need a fancy stereo headset
the sound is good and they clamp well over my ears
most of the fancier headphones start to fall off my ears even when tightening the head band to the max
like the feather weight .
it is absolutely useless
the pictures are grainy , blurry , and have color aberrations galore
you can not even see facial features on people
it is not a true 640x480 camera ; it uses software to obtain the 640x480 advertised resolution
downloads are horribly slow , and the memory is not removeable , so you can not use a better download method
it will drain the batteries with only one loading and unloading of the 2mb memory
this thing is not even useful as a toy for your children
fortunately i bought from a reputable online dealer who took the thing back , and even refunded all shipping charges
do yourself a favor and get an olympus or
. a lot more money , but about the least you can pay for a digital camera that takes decent pictures
do not buy this camera !
i bought two of these for my kids and they are awful
the picture quality is so low that only about <PERCENT> of the photos are worth keeping
and being for my young children , my standards are very low
i bought them almost as a toy , and still i am severely disappointed
do not buy .
i bought the smile to have a handy , inexpensive way of addingphtos to web pages
i didn not want to spend $400 on a camera that wouldbe obsolete in a few months
i figured for $100 i couldn not go wrong
i was mistaken
the smile just has too many compromises
the lens is a tiny item that requires bright light to form an image
battery life is abysmal- it seems to chew up a pair of aas shooting a dozen pictures
i should have spent $200 and gotten a far better camera .
stop !
1/ this camera is not 640x480 , is a fixed 320x240
ccd is not even 1/3 megapixel , is 1/10 i think
images are bad ( like enlarging a thumbnail ? ) print them in an 1x1 inch rectangle and they will be somehow fine , anything bigger is like old cga
when you take shots they look very bad , whatever you do to edit ( software ) and fix them
i have another ( true ) 640x480 camera and pictures are excelent , but these
2/ it doesn not include an ac adapter , so be prepared to buy lots of aa batteries or spend another <NUM> bucks
3/ fine as a serial videoconference camera ( 30 fps ) , but watch for the batteries
4/ take your first picture , and begin to wonder if it is ok
the lack of an lcd screen begins to bother you when you find out you can not review your shots
think about it : you wont review your pictures untill you get to the pc
sorry i am very disappointed .
i am on a small budget this summer , so i bought this camera for fun
it doesn not drain your batteries before you even took a picture ( i took about <NUM> pictures ( without flash ) with my cheap rechargeable batteries )
the four stars missing is for the worst quality i have ever seen in my life
i suggest to never use the flash ( all my pictures taken with flash were <PERCENT> full of light , so it is all white ! ) this camera is too cheap ( i think that my batteries heavier than the camera itself ) you only have to put the cd that it comes with it and it installs itself
i think uploading my pictures ( 16 ) to my pc took <NUM> minutes ! the camera was too easy to use and i wonder why agfa made these things
finally , digital cameras are too expensive and someday the prices will fall down and camcorders will take better pictures
you will regret buying this awful camera !
these speakers stunned me
when my tiny &quot ; came with the pc&quot ; speakers died , i looked into getting some similar little speakers , but then realized that i could spend just a few dollars more for this three speaker set
first , let me say that the subwoofer boooms ! the bass from the compact cube is deeper and more throbbing than my full stereo system
really remarkable
i used this system in my dorm room at columbia university this summer , and all my dorm mates were so amazed that the speakers were frequently borrowed for watching dvds , and one classmate was so impressed that she bought her own set immediately a day after borrowing mine
with the massive boooom of the system , it was easy to see why everyone was so enthusiastic
my only complaint , in fact , is that boom ! the subwoofer doesn not have an independent volume control , so if i turn up the volume on the little speakers , the subwoofer follows right along , thunderously loud
a separate volume control on the subwoofer would have made this speaker set perfect .
this speakers are great sounding little things for the computer
if you are looking for a set of speakers with a subwoofer this is definately not a bad place to start
i have two sets of them and have had no problems with them , and yes
they are loud .
these speakers do not sound bad , don not get me wrong
if the company had actually used a tad more thought when designing the cabling they would have a winner
however , even the sound quality on these is not up to par with the set of cambridge soundworks/creative labs computer speakers i have that cost about the same price
the seems fine , but the satellites seem to have a much cheaper tinnier sound than the creative labs speakers
for gaming they sound fine , but music clearly sounds better on the creative labs speakers to me
but where these speakers truly fail the end user is in the wiring
unlike the creative labs set that is configured more like a standard set of stereo speakers , allowing you to position your satellites anywhere in the room to achieve optimal separation , the altec lansing set has very short cables
the left speaker has to be within four feet of the subwoofer
then the right speaker has to be within six feet of the left
then to add insult to injury , the five foot wire from the computer to the speaker system has to plug into the left speaker
worst of all , they everything
on the creative labs system , the computer connects to the subwoofer which connects via standard speaker cable to the satellites
wonderful and simple design ! the altec lansings have wires of configuration into the left speaker and chincy speaker wire that is between the speakers ( maybe if you rip them apart and splice wires you could expand it , but do you want to ? )
the easy configuration of your computer speaker system is a large percentage of its sound and convenience
dump these babies for the better sounding creative labs setup .
i got this from a yard sale
the cords are unwieldy
the bass is too strong and is not adjustable
stay away from systems that do not have adjustable subwoofers .
certainly not the best speakers you could ever have for your computer , the acs33 nevertheless fills an important niche in the market
if you are looking for subwoofered sound on the cheap , this is probably your best bet
they are competent performers , without taking price into consideration
look at how much they cost , and you will think there aren not better speakers made on the planet
they have the potential to work , as do most speakers , on both macintosh and windows machines
interestingly , they also have a secondary use
because they don not need a computer to work at all , they can be plugged directly into any stereo system that has the ability to output its sound ( that is , one which has an audio out jack )
they can thus give resonant stereo sound--even to lowly portables
you will think twice about whether you really need to upgrade to a whole new system after hearing these speakers
( before buying for this purpose , however , i'd recommend you go to
com and grab the manual for this product , just to make sure that it is compatible with your stereo
) inasmuch as there are drawbacks to the speakers , they are ones you would expect from a product so inexpensive
as another reviewer has rightly pointed out , there is no volume control on the woofer
there is also no bass , treble , or volume control
and the speakers are rated at only <NUM> watts , with a relatively indelicate frequency response
but , big deal
if , like most people , you have got your computer jammed into a corner in a busy room , you don not have the soundspace to set up a truly extraordinary auditory experience
if you have got a lot of people living with you , anything more than <NUM> watts is discourteous , anyway
unless you have a room that you can dedicate to the computer , and that is relatively isolated from others , it is extremely unlikely you would actually be able to use more than this system offers .
the acs33 speaker system came with the pc i bought way back in 2001
the pc was an at the time , known as abs
after researching my options for best pc under $1000 , i opted for the abs mainly because the review raved about the incredible clear and accurate sound from the included speakers
i still have that pc as a back up , but i continue to use the altec lansings like a small bookshelf stereo system
i hooked them up by simply plugging them into the headphone jack on my mp3 player , and the sound is just incredible
it puts out <NUM> watts total , as much as some bookshelf stereo systems costing hundreds more ! the bass is incredible
i have it sitting on an area rug so i don not get evicted
the highs are so accurate , and can be tweaked using the eq on the mp3 player
midrange is a bit lacking , but this also can be compensated for a bit with your eq settings
if you can find these used , get 'em !
i have to ring in on this item
i have owned mine for over <NUM> years now and i sit at my home office desk many hours a day talking into it
there are many more elaborate and much more expensive items out there but my question is , why ? why would you spend <NUM> or <NUM> or even <NUM> dollars on something when this <NUM> dollar headset works as well as it does
i have never had anyone complain that my voice was weak or that i sounded odd when using this unit
in fact , i don not think anyone can ever tell i am on a headset
i can hear the caller crystal clear and the noise cancelling mic delivers as it was meant to
in my opinion , manufacturers do not always put as much effort in the headset jack section of phones they do not expect to be used in an office setting
this is not to say all office or phones are exceptional
some of these are weak in this respect
with simple home phones , doubly so
my motorola soho set has an excellent jack section
i mention this because this will have a huge impact on your experience with this or any headset
one huge problem for me with wired headsets has always been , when walking around with the unit on , i get the cord caught on doorknobs and various hazzards around the home/office
when this happens , it rips the phone off of your ear and has destroyed more than one more expensive unit
hence , the willingness to try this less expensive unit
funny thing is , although i have managed to rip this thing off several times , i don not seem to have damaged it in any way
it has outlasted every single headset i have ever owned
and it works and sounds as great now as it did the day i got it
i bought this thing figuring if it worked but only lasted <NUM> or <NUM> months , i could just buy another one and save some money going this route
well , if it ever does break , i can assure you i will be buying another one ! one side note , this makes a great gift for someone who wants a headset but doesn not want to spend the money for one
they will never know you spent <NUM> dollars on it
not that i would do anything like that ; > ) if you cannot handle an over the ear headset , or if you are wireless , this is obviously not a fit for you
if you are using a wired headset , you should give this a try .
if this is your first headset or you don not plan to have heavyuse , this is as good as it gets
. the sound quality is goodand it is relatively comfortable
however , if you are going to spend time with this , the plantronics m175 by far worth the additional expense
much more invisible from the stand point of the user ( you completely forget its on your head ) and the listener on the other end
i have them both and switch to the plantronics unit when i know it is going to be a long call or i going to be moving about .
this lightweight headset does the job , and the price is right
it is held up well for <NUM> months of daily use
the fact that it lightly hangs on the ear rather than fitting snugly took a couple days to get used to , but it is nice that it is so light .
this excellent headset in an outstanding bargin
sound quality is excellent with several cell phones i have tried , and it is good with most cordless house phones ( cordless phones sometimes have poor gain on the mic )
in fact , sound quality is vastly better with other types of earpieces and ear buds
in a normal room , no one will know you are using it
in a car , it is slightly noticable
some friends complain that the earpiece flops around a bit , but indeed , it never falls off
( unless you have really small ears ) .
not many things you can buy for $10 anymore
but this is definitely worth the small investment
the headset is comfortable , has a good microphone/earpiece and is almost unnoticeable after a few minutes of use
make sure you have a phone with a good belt clip that isn not too heavy to carry around
the only downside to the headset is that there is no volume control and no mute button , so it is best to get a phone that has these functions in the phone itself
i use it with a couple of different cordless phones and it performs flawlessly with both .
i was very disappointed with this product
as one other reviewer said the stem is too short
so others can hardly hear me
obviously , if they can hardly hear me then what good is the product ? for instance , ever try getting a flight itinerary straight when the other person can hardly hear you ? ( and i am short myself , so it is definitely not a matter of my having oversized head/mouth dimensions
) but , even when i took off the headset and held the mike right near my mouth and at other positions the sound was described as muffled and somewhat low , though without background noise
i also found the headset somewhat uncomfortable and difficult to put on at the moment
i don not have a need to wear one all the time , but just for certain calls
i often found myself fumbling to get it on
i think i will try an model next .
the mike wand is only <NUM> 1/2 inches long
since i have <NUM> inches between my ear and mouth the mike did not get close enough and my voice was too low
it was otherwise comfortable and i imagine it would be fine for a person with a smaller face .
this headset works very well for me
i was skeptical at first about the plastic thing over my ear , but it is so light that i scacely notice
i also worried becuase the mike wound up next to my cheek not my mouth , but it seems to have no adverse effect on the sound
people i am talking to can not tell i am using it , and to me the sound is great
at the price , what is not to like ? i got one for each phone in our house .
i modded this to attach to my ad700x is
perfect gaming headset now
i hear and speak with clarity now
antlion modmic broke and didn not feel like spending $50 plus on the 4
bought the mic and some mounting tape ! would recommend over and over !
i bought this mic to put it on my headphone ad700s , i knew cutting the plastic headband off if the microphone was garbage i'd just have to eat the cost
luckily as others have suggested on forums and even in reviews here the mic works great , had to use some industrial strength sticky tape to keep them on the metal of my headphones , but for the price this microphone is unbeatable in sound quality .
this mic is very popular around gamers , espicially if you want to fragtality is mic mod
this mic used to cost around $5 dollars
it is a great mic , but why is there a need to increase the price ten fold ? i would just go with a zalman
if you have $50 to spend on a mic after $100+ on a headset and $130 on a mixamp go right ahead , but that is something that i will not be doing .
i have been using this mic for a couple of years now with a nice pair of headphones
velcroed them on and they are good to go !
i am a gamer , and i don not use headsets , i use headphones , with a seperate mic
i saw someone on
org who bought one of these and used industrial strength velcro to attach one of these to their ad700s , so i decided to try it with my akgs
it works pretty well , but the mic is real quiet right out of the box , but after turning the volume all the way up and putting the microphone boost up to 10db , it is super clear and crisp
if you put the mic boost up to 20db you can hear large amounts of feedback ( buzzing/humming noise ) , but that it not too big of a problem , because it works fine with a 10db boost
i would recommend this to any gamer , but if you can spend a little more money , go for the ant lion mod mic v2
edit 10/8/13 : i recently replaced the original cable with a cable that connects both the mic and the headphones in one cable , and has a volume control and mute button , and this seemed to reduce the amount of feedback ( buzzing/humming noise ) .
as i write this i am sad to say that my trackball is finally starting to show its age as it is becoming difficult to register clicks after <NUM> years of solid , daily use
the design put years back on the life of my wrist and saved me from certain carpal tunnel issues
it is not easy for everyone to get used to it as i have laughed at many who have tried to use my pc for something quick , but just like anything else it has a learning curve and i simply cannot imagine life without it
i came to amazon hoping i could somehow score one of these without destroying my bank account and i fell on the floor when i saw what people are charging
the sad part is that i actually considered spending $500 on getting one of these for a few moments
if i knew <PERCENT> that any of these ridiculously priced trackball fxs on here were brand new , i would actually buy one
that is how good this thing is .
this is a great large trackball that was discontinued after a few years by logitech
it is however , very much a vintage collectible -- still functional as a trackball -- but not current technology
the reviews start in 1999 , people
* there is no way logitech will provide a windows <NUM> driver for this
still many users believe this is one of the best trackballs ever made , comparable perhaps to themicrosoft trackball explorer-- also no longer made
a new mste one will set you back hundreds ; they are scarce
*amazon says they first stocked this in 1973 ? what is that , <NUM> years before amazon launched ? wasn not the web called arpanet then ?
this mouse has served me well for the past <NUM> years , and i hope it lasts another 10 ! it is ergonomic , it doesn not need to be cleaned very often , it is very precise ( far more precise than the logitech currently sells ) , it has four buttons assignable to just about any function
superior in every way
recently i tried to buy another one for work but couldn not find anything like it
if you can find one , buy it !
and make sure to register it so logitech realizes it is still popular !
i have two of these , one i just bought ( condition ) and one i bought new several years ago which is now dead
people who do design and need fine cursor control absolutely love the fx because the large ball gives you just that - better fine control than any other mouse or trackball
however , some actions , like drag and drop , are difficult to do with the traditional left button and ball , and instead require the use of the 3rd button as a drag lock , which is easy to do , but different than you may be used to -- once you get the hang of it , it becomes second nature
the fourth button can be programmed for scrolling
the buttons are programmable - you can choose what function you want them to perform
the hand placement over the curvaceous fx body is also very comfortable and even relaxing - once you get used to it , and don not try to drag and drop with the left button and ball
you can use both your thumb and one or even two or three fingers to move the ball around without ever tiring or straining
the downside of this model is that logitech has abandoned it due to a patent infringement suit , and no parts are available for repairs , and no one i know repairs them
to get a part , you must cannibalize another trackman marble fx , and the cannibalized parts will already be used and aged with a short life span -- assuming you can get a used one with still usable components
there are no new fx is anywhere
another downside is that the fx only came with either a serial port or a ps/2 connector
there are no usb or wireless versions
and every attempt to utilize a usb adapter results in some functionality being lost
the serial port has long gone the way of the dodo bird , and ps/2 ports are on new model computers
in another <NUM> years the fx will be largely obsolete and incompatible
this has already affected the going price
whereas a couple of years ago , even a fx commanded a steep price , a fx now command less than $100 ( i won my minty for only $82 just yesterday as i write this )
yes , there are vendors still listing fx is near $300 , but they aren not getting many takers , if any
the bottom line for this once very superior design is that apart from a few fanatics ( like myself ) who have yet to upgrade to a new pc ( or mac ) the fx is dated , and soon will be obsolete and incompatible with the new equipment coming out .
i am writing this review in 2014 , many many years after this device has disappeared from the company is product lineup
i can state that this is the best input device i have ever used
i have owned several , and had them on my work and home computers for very detailed cad , 3d modeling , and precision photoshop work
the downside with this ( and any trackball or mouse ) is that dust accumulates inside the housing but this is super easy to clean when it does
i occasionally think about replacements , even though it looks funny , even outdated , no one makes a &<HASHTAG> ; fingertip&<HASHTAG> ; controlled trackball with ergonomics quite like this so i stick with it
logitech if you are out there , please bring us a modern version !
once upon a time i got sick of the gunk build up on all the mice and trackballs i had used , it got to the point where they would bump and jump on the mouse pads
i was intrigued when i saw the technology used in the trackman line , detecting position using the tiny dots on the ball
now having used the fx trackman at home and at work for over <NUM> years , i find that it is the still the best input device of its kind , including the new msft optical mice
once one gets used to the button placement and develops the dexterity to utilise the trackball , constantly smooth and consistent movement will reward them
with no moving parts for the tracking assembly the user only rarely [once a year ? ] has to pop the ball out and clean the sensors
this trackball does very well in digital art work with photoshop and is especially excellent when used to play classic trackball arcade games through mame32 emulation , missile command , tempest , centipede , arkanoid , etc
the tertiary buttons are recognized and used as scroll wheel counterparts in win2k ; it is a nice fluff feature
my only wish would be that logitech eventually upgrade them to use usb so i can plug them into my msft keyboards
otherwise , highly recommended .
this is one great trackball
the product i bought is actually the cordless version of the fx trackball , but it is basically the same as this one except for the cordless/wireless feature
the ergonomics are a little different also but it is basically the same trackball device
you can not beat the smoothness of this trackball
i have seen lots of them over the years but none ever impressed me enough to buy one until now
now that i have tried one i am a convert
the action is extremely smooth once you adapt a little to the finger movements to move the ball
also , getting used to the placement of the four different buttons takes a little time
but once this is accomplished the ability to move smoothly and quickly around your computer screen is vastly improved over a typical mouse
the buttons are all configurable as to function , but i have found sticking with the default settings during the software setup is the best way to go
there is one thing i am trying to see how it works out
i reconfigured button <NUM> as the delete key
this is sort of convenient because it allows you to browse and delete files just with the trackball instead of having to use the other hand to hit the delete key on the keyboard after highlighting a file with the trackball
pretty convenient for those occasional cleanup tasks on your hard disk
another thing i have found useful is to use medium instead of low acceleration , which allows you to shoot all the way across the screen by moving the trackball maybe an inch and a half or so , but then to drop the overall sensitivity down a bit
the default setting for trackball sensitivity is right in the middle of the range on the slider adjustment bar
i drop it down one more tack on the slider bar
this assists in hitting all those small buttons when using high resolution on your monitor
the medium acceleration gets you there faster but then you have more control once you are there to zero in on the button
try it and see if you like this better than the default settings
you will find these settings by opening up the trackball program menu , clicking on &quot ; mouse properties , &quot ; and then on the &quot ; motion&quot ; tab
one last thing i do to customize the operation of the trackball is you can check a box that causes the cursor to jump to the highlighted button of a new dialog box
i find this useful also
i noted a very interesting new feature
one of the buttons when clicked pops up the &quot ; webwheel
&quot ; this is a wheel with <NUM> different pieces which are configurable as web addresses or for other functions , such as go back , reload , go to favorites/bookmarks , and so on
when you hit this button , the wheel comes up , and you basically have a second menu to choose selection from
pretty cool
i should mention the software install is a little
the instructions say to disconnect your mouse and plug in the new trackball ( with the power off )
however , when you boot the machine , windows <NUM> sees the now missing mouse and wants to autodetect your hardware again and recreate the entire driver database
not knowing what would happen i just cancelled out of this screen and let the computer boot up normally but without any mouse function
i then loaded the software , using the tab key to navigate around to configure everything , which wasn not too hard , and after you are finished it asks do you want to reboot , and after that the trackball works normally
although not cheap , all in all a fine product that is worth the money .
i originally paid $64 for this trackball at staples back in 2002
i am impressed at how the value of this mouse , used , has gone into the hundreds
yet , i am not surprised
this is an amazing trackball because it involves the movement of any <NUM> of the <NUM> leftmost fingers of the right hand
this means your hand won not get into repetitive motions that may cause permanent damage later on
i have been using this mouse for years and it is still going strong
you just have to clean the ball and lenses once in a while
my mouse is ps/2 but i am ordering a converter ( ps/2 to usb )
many attempts to convert me to other models have failed
my hand is completely comfortable and the buttons fall naturally where the fingers rest
truly perfect design
i just can not believe it has gone up in price over the years , yet i can understand why
a true investment in the health of your hand , fingers and wrist
totally worth the money .
its been about <NUM> years since i got my first trackman marble fx
at this time i still have 3
having tried just about every type and variation of input device on the planet , i never found any other mouse device the equal of the tmft
of course , being a <NUM> year old design , never updated , it lacks the buttons and scrolling abilities of modern mice
which is too bad , because if logitech revived this trackball , and updated it with <NUM> more buttons and new software , it would outsell everything else on the market by a wide margin .
i have had three of these now in around <NUM> years
yes i said <NUM> years , or at least since they first came out
they are the best trackball that was ever made , ever made
they fit your hand like no other trackball out there including any that logitech has made since
i really hope that logitech will make them again , because you can not beat them
they are so expensive now that most of the time you can not find one that you can afford
the few that are out there that are new are being sold for close to $500
that is just unheard of
of course those doing that probably won not sell it or maybe they might
used ones are usually really used and the buttons will go out sooner or later
but if you can find one that has the logitech logo intact on the top and hasn not been rubbed off , then it wasn not used much because that is the first thing to go and it doesn not take long for that to go , maybe about a year or less of use
the one i have just purchased , the logo is sharp and so i know that it hasn not been used much
even this one wasn not cheap , but it was cheap enough that i was willing to foot the bill for it because you can not beat this trackball .
i have been using this trackball at work for six years and i love it
i work in a 3d cad program that is primarily controlled by the mouse so it gets worked hard all day , every day
this track ball never skips a beat and is comfortable to use , i find standard mice to be fatiguing
after more than twelve thousand hours of use the primary left button has given out on me
the switch still functions but the button has broken and does not move anymore
i am very disapointed to find that logitech no longer makes this trackball , i will be replacing it with a used one from ebay .
i got these because of the price and they not to bad a headset
they are very light and stay in place on your head
the mouth mic foam come off very easy but they work like they should .
i like this headset
i have four of them
i find i use ptt most of the time , to avoid cut off first syllables , etc
when i absolutely have to be , though , the vox will work , too
decent , understandable audio , unlike some i have used
these work perfectly with my motorola mr350 radios , also purchased fromamazon
i got them ( headsets ) only as an
the sensitivity settings on theradios ( for ) for vor use are a little touchy
i prefer using theptt button with headsets connected
no breathing or extraneous soundskicking in the transmitter
still , a good headset .
these work very well with my walkie talkies and give you some privacy when talking through the walkie talkies
i highly recommend them .
i bought a new pair of motorola talkabout fv300 radios and it simply does not work with them
when i plug it in , turn it on and press the ptt button , the radio starts transmitting and doesn not stop until i shut the radio off
i knew the vox feature wouldn not work , but it was my understanding that it was supposed to still work with manual operation of the ptt button
it does not
however , it does work with my older talkabout which is a t5000 , but not with vox
i am giving it two stars because they should have been more clear as to which radios work and which don not .
works well
only issue i have is it appears to automatically activate vox mode
and i'd rather use ptt
other note might be that compared to the old spirit gt headset , it is not a comfortable
but it is good enough .
purchase for the motorola ms350r talkabout waterproof radios
the vox feature automatically sets up when this is plugged in .
this is very good headset , sound quality is good
the headband is adjustable and very confortable
i gave it <NUM> stars instead of <NUM> because it doesn not do vox with my fr50s ( because the fr50 doesn not have vox capability )
price is reasonable too
what more can i say about a simple headset ?
okay , it doesn not use batteries , it doesn not light up , and it doesn not cost a lot
but this headset/boom mic is an essential accessory for the talkabouts for this simple reason : talkabouts have control ( vox ) when used with a plugin headset/mic
we have also evaluated the earbud/mic combo for bike riders and found it almost unworkable ( it picks up road noise and , to me , the earbud causes excruciating pain after a day of use )
the headset is a much better solution
the band actually fits over a safety helmet , and the rubber pad grips the plastic shell securely
the boom mic rejects most road noise , and soon becomes forgotten in the course of routine use
( it quickly comes back to the foreground when i try to sip from my water bottle ! ) if you purchase one of the talkabouts , consider this as your second accessory purchase -- your first should be a carrying holster or case
now , if motorola would only agree on a partnership with jabra technologies to produce a jabra earset for the talkabouts , my happiness would be complete .
plugged this into a talkabout t6200 and it just transmitted
transmit button didn not work , vox didn not work
i have a pair of some older model , i should try the headset on those
would give this <NUM> stars if i could .
the item served its use ; however not the quality i thought it was priced at .
good product at a good price
the earpiece has soft foam so that it does not hurt the ear after hours of use as one finds with an ear bud or the over the ear headset
be careful to match the headset to the actual radio purshaced
this headset does not work with all radios .
this mic works well , but it is a bit awkward
i got it because the webcam i was using didn not have a microphone for my yahoo messenger and skype live chats
it was crisp and clear sounding , but i have since upgraded my webcam and no longer need it so much .
good quality , good audio and made by motorola
was going for a ear cover design but this is way sleeker .
i bought these earbuds specifically for my helmet and ease of use
as it turned out the reception for these at high speeds was unreadable and even worse when transmitting
not good if you are looking for a cheap solution to communicate between motorcycles
the boom mic is sold by motorola are perfect for this
static communications this set up is fine , hiking , skiing , something like that
for the purpose that i purchased them for , awful
overall product though , good .
i found that the ear bud was very large for my ear and it kept falling out even though it was under my pull over hat
it works fine and the push to talk button by the mic bud is a nice feature .
this is a nice addition to my walkie talkies
make sure you have the right model walkie talkies for this mic .
there are quite afew out there that are more bulky looking
this particular one is more compact
its features include : an earbud with a mic and ptt ( )
the cord is a bit short ; however , with my height ( 5 , 6 ) , it stands to be just right
i was told that an extension can be pick up at a local radio shack .
excellent motorola quality and when paired with the ta280 is excellent volume levels ( plus control ) , it allows you to use it even in crowded , noisy environments
the ease of use and its inconspicuousness make it an invaluable addition to the talk abouts , but there is room for improvement
my biggest complaint is that the ta280/289 don not allow for the alert tone ( call tones / menu tones / etc
) volumes to be regulated
this makes for some very uncomfortably loud noise spikes with that earbud only an inch or so from your eardrum
the ta280/289 do allow the alert tones to be disabled , but that makes it a little more difficult to operate ( especially when you have them tucked away under your outer clothing )
my only other complaint was in the design of the ptt/mic housing
i would have preferred something a little easier to use with gloves on ( the ptt button is 1/2&quot ; from the mic and pressing it with gloves on covers the mic
in closing , the alert tone volume issue is a ta280/289 one , not this units and i'd buy this again if i were to lose this one , but i sure wish they'd improve on it .
this product does exactly what its supposed to do
i don not understand people who expected this product to support vox
it does not say anything about vox in product description
i personally don not like vox , because i don not want my children to hear what i am saying when i fall down while skiing : - )
anyway the product is ok
the only problem for me is a very short wire , that is why i gave it <NUM> stars .
very dissatisfied with this , the earphone ( earbud ) is fine , but your voice is very muffled and garbled using the microphone
even a females voice , usually more clear than a males voice , is very hard to understand using the microphone
i have also not been able to get the ivox feature to work with this either .
worked but not well made and i have stopped using them and bought a better quality earpiece they did however work
i purchased these to use with the motorola talkabout and the cases while biking to work
i sometimes rode a little faster than my biking partner and these helped us to stay in touch
this was a good purchase .
i have only one complaint about this earbud/mic unit - the cord is too short
otherwise , the sound quality is good and the mic with ptt works fine
a 2
5mm extension cord from radio shack ( meant for phone headsets , <HASHTAG>-2003 ) alleviates the cord problem , however
the earbud cushion is comfortable
to be discreet , this is an excellent accessory for your motorola frs radio .
works good but i am worried for how long
the wire is thin and i am always worried its going to break at the many connection points
works with the motorola two way radios .
if the cord was <NUM> foot longer , <NUM> stars
i don not get it
is someone saving <NUM> cents for every one of these ? or
make the earpiece cord shorter and the thicker part longer
would have been great if it came with a removable ear clip/wire but not really complaining about that
maybe a future feature
then again , if they can not make the cord <NUM> foot longer , i wouldn not expect any other luxuries
functionally seems fine .
this push to talk ear bud worked great needed it for work and it never failed me
would purchase again .
i was wondering why the radio would go into a weird locked mode in which you could no longer use it
i had to shut the radio off , then turn it back on again
just a slight movement from the male plug ( that goes into the radio ) , would cause the radio to be unusable
i found out the male plug was not inserted all the way into the radio is headset socket
the problem is the rubber molding around the male plug was too much , not allowing a good &<HASHTAG> ; seat&<HASHTAG> ;
i used an xacto knife and cut away at the rubber molding , thus allowing a good &<HASHTAG> ; seat&<HASHTAG> ; of the male plug
no more weird locking of the radio anymore
i also had to do this with the other motorola headsets that came with my motorola radios as well .
we all use these with our motorola radios while hunting
the animals are not spooked due to the earpiece
the earpiece fits comfortably in my ear without the foam
just press the button clipped to your collar and others can hear you even with a quiet whisper .
the sound quality is good
i purchased these to plug into walkie talkies
as someone who is been use to wearing the actual walkie talkie unit on his pants i had to begin to clip it on my shirts because the plug and its cord are short and tight
if i wear the walkie on my belt and have the speaker on my shoulder , the audio jack always pulls out of the walkie unit because of the tension
for my purposes these are not ideal and if you are use to wearing the walkie unit on your belt line then don not purchase these
if you are okay with wearing the walkie unit on your shirt or somewhere a lot higher than your belt line then go for it .
i haven not really tried this yet , it hangs in my wah and whacks me in the head while i am driving
i have to rig up some cord restraints that will allow me to still use the thing
i think it will help me communicate when i get the instalation worked out
i bought this because when i do my volunteer work it is extremely hard to hear
so with this one i could hear everything that goes over the radio
this is a <NUM> pin remote speaker
your radio needs to have a slot for <NUM> pin to use this
-built to have the radio on low and still be able to hear everything ( keep in mind of the noise around you ) -push to talk built use a safety pin so i could attach it my uniform better
may pull the clothes down a bit ( need to break in the wires has to be looser ) this is something smallthis does have a clip on the back of the speakers but i dont like to use it
overallprice cheaper now compared to when it first name came out ( about $15 less ) sound goodjust overall its very good
i would recommend this .
bought it for skiing and although its convenient , its hard to understand people on it
i think itay just be the cold temperature but its been pretty awful about every time i have skied
i used it on a warm day to test it and it seemed fine though
guess it just isn not great for what i had in mind
the cord is also very short .
these motorola mics worked great for our gmrs radios
our crew prefers using these in the attics instead of pulling the walkies out of their pocket or belt clips
speaker : - when you plug in the microphone the sound you hear come out of the mic- when you press the transmit button on the mic or the radio the microphone acts like a microphone
- sound quality is nice- volume is adjustable by volume control on radiocord : - my main gripe is the cord- the coiled cord on the new mics are tight from waist to shoulder- by stretching the coil out this problem goes away
almost wish that the cord came so the new cords weren not so tight
clip : - the clip clips at the top of the mic
- it would have been better if the clip swiveled on the back of the mic as everyone doesn not like to clip the mic on their shoulder lapel or collar
i prefer the mic in front of me and being able to swivel the clip would have been a major plus
quality : - the mics are high quality and work well
out of the <NUM> i ordered i only had to return <NUM> due to failure right out of the package
overall , great mics at a descent price
at first the cord will be annoying but with time it should stretch and work better on adults
may look a little funny though if all your kids had these mics on their shoulders
people may give you strange looks .
motorola <NUM> remote speaker mic works well with my scanner , with the speaker mic my radio sounds loud and clear .
the mic works well , and has a built in speaker , so you can have the audio feed close at hand
sadly , the cord is so taught and tightly wound , there is no possible way to have the radio at waist level and the mic at shoulder level
after months of trying to stretch the cord , it remains as short and tight as the day i received it
when it was attached at shoulder level , the radio often jumped off of my belt ( and survives only because the cable did not detach , and the radio did not ever strike the ground )
i have been relegated to attaching the mic to my tie at about sternum level , which works but requires a higher audio level output than if it were on my shoulder near my ear
i give it four stars because it does what it says it will do , keeps me from having to constantly remove and replace my radio ( and also , because after my repeated stretching attempts , the cord has not shorted out
no small feat )
i truly wish it were more flexible or longer , but i guess it does the job .
used for a long road trip with <NUM> cars
the cord lenth isn not horrible , it was ok for my use but i agree
it could be longer
overall for the <NUM> bucks i paid for a used one was worth it .
we purchased two of these in hopes of keeping the radios from falling and breaking
this would keep the radios in our guys pockets
worked great for two weeks then nothing
for both of them
they are heavy and seemed well made
bummer .
it looked good in the box but after hooking it up to my radio i soon realized it is a joke
you can hear people through it but couldn not talk through it
i had to unplug the mic if i wanted to talk to anyone
<PERCENT> waste of $20
i would return it but my luck with getting my money back when i return something isn not good since i never do
save your $20 and buy something else .
i was a bit concerned my older motorola radio wouldn not work with this product so took a chance , but works flawlessly and have purchased a second one for skiing .
it works very well with all the talkabout radios i have
only drawback is the clip started to break after <NUM> days of daily use in the florida parks
when the clip breaks it gets annoying having to carry it in your hand .
purchased for the motorola ms350r talkabout waterproof radios the mic comes in handy if you keep the radios on you hip .
i bought this product for the handhelds i bought a couple of weeks prior
i used this for my job because i was not always in the cafe and if something was needed from the storerooms or there was a customer complaint/problem
they worked great and did as i expected to !
i got these for my hunting radios they work great and make suiting up easy radio chest pocket mic on your lapel good to go
just one thing that little made in china badge on it errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
i am impressed with this speaker/mic
i am a first responder so i was interested in getting something like what i have at work for my family radios
the mic is very sensitive , so have it about " away from your mouth and talk normally
they will hear you fine
the weight feels very substantial in your hand and feels almost as rugged as what i have at work
i can tell that this is a motorola product .
these mics are pretty legit
speaker quality : the speaker quality is pretty good just as long the user on the other end does their part in speaking into the mic correctly
i have the mr350r waterproof version and the remote speaker is pretty close to the quality of the handhelds speaker
the remote speaker does have a bit more treble to it but not bad enough to where its a problem
durability : the plastic housing isn not the thickest , but thick enough to where it is durable enough for normal use unlike the remote mics for law enforcement
the feels very sturdy and durable
only gripe about the cord is that it is quite short and the coil makes it tight from waist to lapel
some may want this but if it weren not as tight and uncoiled easier then it would probably be better
! update ! i used this remote speaker mic for <NUM> days while snowboarding
i wore it on the strap of the backpack where it was exposed to snow and cold constantly
i am not the best snowboarder so i was in the snow all over the place
the mic isn not labeled as water proof or even weather resistant but it definitely got wet and still works like a charm
the clip was strong enough and never fell off of the strap even after all of my spills
i love this thing and want to use it every chance i get .
i have only had it about a week , but i needed it to use with my motorola walkie talkie
i walk about <NUM> miles a day even in the the cold weather we had this season
my radio kept dieing out when i tried to use it to talk to my husband on my walk from home to a high school on the other side of i96 here in redford , mi
the cold was a major factor and i tried insulating the radio but it still was dieing out a few days after recharging my batteries
i could have recharged the batteries every couple of days that would have helped , but i try to let them run down before charging
plus pushing the button is cumbersome with a hand that has to have both a glove and a mitten on to keep reasonably warm
i did buy another small set that had an earphone , but the sound was not loud enough , i may have dome some damage to that set that caused that problem , don not know , but needed to try something a little more workable so we bought this , and i clip it on the pocket just below my collar and put the radio inside my coat which is in the middle of the coat above my waist
so i was able to find a good position for everything and so far this has been my best solution
i will probably even use it in the summer because of the ease of use
my husbands voice comes in loud and clear and it is minimum inconvenience to push the button even with a double protected hand
the button is longer than the one with the earphone , it works great .
this mic is perfect for the person who must have his/her hands free a majority of the time
i use it on an older motorola t5500 radio
the mic comes with a strong metal clip to attach to your clothing or belt
the speaker sound quality and volume is very good and the ppt button on the mic is easy to use
the connector is a press fit so if the cord is stretched too far the connector may disconnect
a small "tie wrap" wrapped around the cord and the radio antenna will solve this issue .
i have been using for <NUM> weeks now for work communications , with only one problem
the coiled cord is so stiff it pull the mike off wherever i clip it
either make cord inches longer , or she more flexible cord .
nice having a speaker mic
setting the channel on the radio and putting it in the side pocket of the pack and only having the speaker mic on the shoulder strap
too bad motorola can not reduce its weight
when hiking , every ounce counts .
i havent had a chance to use the casettes yet but since they are brand new in an unopened factory package i am sure they are just fine
im just glad they got here quickly !
what can i say about this product , fair price and gets job done
seems to outlast competition with repeated use .
not sure if these tapes are knockoffs , but these tapes jam in our sony portable recorders
they seem to work ok in our lanier desk recorders
if we hold one of the the sony cassettes next to a tdk cassette ( which work fine in the ) the tape in these sony cassettes looks visibly taller
unfortunately we are stuck with about <NUM> now
i do not recommend this seller or these tapes .
my idiot producer lost my recorder , so did not get to use more than one of these .
i received these in perfect condition
they are used with a recorder
i have trouble with good sound from the cassette recorder , so i don not know if i have the correct type of cassettes or the recorder is of poor quality .
someone borrowed my sony mini tape recorder to get some detailed infomation and asked if they could keep the tape
i assured them that was fine i would just buy some
boy , was i surprised when i checked out all the local stores to find that all that was available was digital recorders
so i checked out amazon and there they were
so thanks for the variey of products supplied by the sellers on amazon
com !
for several years my brother had a similar ( though significantly less durable ) trash bag
it was slightly larger but , not having the elastic top , simply spilled things if you filled it up
the velcro on the bottom also wasn not "" like this
not that i intend to try myself , but i have seen liquid poured into these with little to no leakage ! that is wonderful ! heaven forbid the idiot in the back seat throws an almost empty soda in upside down ! lol i also got some comparably sized trash bag inserts that are held in by the elastic top band nicely ! this prevents any spilling and makes for easy disposal ! tie the top , unvelcro the bottom , and slide out your sealed trash bag ! works much better than my plastic grocery bag hanging off one side of the shifter ! ( also doesn not take up leg room in the passenger seat ! ) excellent product , especially from the price !
the only reason i didn not give this <NUM> starts is because i am having a problem finding a place to hang it
not a product problem , it is an issue with me and my vehicle ( i don not want to block vents by attaching this to the passenger area in front
also note mine came with a webbed , adjustable strap - not the string setup in the picture .
this bag seems durable , the elastic top keeps stuff from flying out , and the easy dump bottom makes dumping it in the dumpster easy
what more do you want from a trash bag ?
i bought this to go in my '05 subaru impreza obs , since i needed a new one to replace one that i bought 10+ years ago
this one totally puts that bag to shame , as lame as that may sound
the elastic top keeps the trash in , and the rolled bottom makes releasing the trash very easy
i appreciate the way that it hangs as well , keeping its top frame from being too cumbersome and taking away any of my valuable space inside my compact car
great purchase , and for a killer price .
this is a small and cute bag , a book size
if you have a long drive trip , you may need a bigger one , except dump it often
if you have kids on the trip , you need a bigger one .
i like this trash bag it fits the bill for me pretty well
just about the right size bag i am not sure i would want it any bigger , i think it would get in your passengers way as they get in and out
i really like the elastic closure on the top if it does get bumped nothing spills out
its also really easy to empty with the velcro along the bottom
i use this in my work car and i am going to purchase another for my personal car .
this bag is great for keeping the trash together in one spot in the car
before i got it i would throw garbage on the backseat floor and clear out every couple weeks , which made for a cluttered gross back seat floor
this handles that pretty well
couple cons though , it is smaller than the picture might indicate so it fills up rather quickly ( make sure to check out the dimensions ) , and it is not always easy to empty out
the velcro does hold the bottom closed very well , just if it is really full , you might have to reach in and pull stuff out when you empty it
this is still much better than grabbing the crap off the floor , and i am very happy with the purchase .
great solution for my car
it hasn not failed in any way
i have used it for over a year now and would certainly rather have it than not .
i have tried other bags
this one is unobtrusive so it doesn not detract from the looks of my interior
because it has a cinch top rather than a flap , it is easy to drop things into it without being distracted
this is my favorite feature
the hole is big enough to put things in but small enough to keep them there
the small piece of velcro keeps it affixed
my former bag had a long piece and i didn not want to stick that to my nice car
it empties easily
really , this does the trick
i resisted crapping up my car with a trash bag for so long
but realized i was crapping up my car with wrappers and other misc trash
this is really good .
neat little s/w radio
made a great gift
great price , fast delivery .
i was expecting the g2000a to be much better made than it appears to be
the case is plastic , and not particularly good plastic at that
the seams between the front and back halves of the case don not fit together well , leaving an unpleasant sharp edge
the leather cover is nice , and , unlike the plastic case , gives the radio the feel of an item that apparently once sold for $180 , or there abouts
i bought the radio thinking it would be an excellent travel alarm/radio
however , in reality it is much larger and heavier than i expected
the above criticisms all pale into insignificance compared to the reception and sound quality
both are extremely poor
this radio can only lock onto the strongest of stations , and even then there is a fair amount of accompanying 'hiss'
i don not live in an area with great radio reception ; however , my boston acoustics receptor radio has no problem tuning into most stations
if the grundig scans the fm band it only finds a grand total of <NUM> stations
short wave is basically worthless on this radio ( as is the am band )
for $40 this radio is not a particularly good buy
there are much better radios for the same price , or significantly less
the leather cover adds a bit of uniqueness
in its absence , this radio would be worth $20 , at the very most
bottom line - this radio looks really nice in photos , but dissapoints in reality ( both in terms of fit and finish , and tuner quality ) .
the grundig g2000a is like the series anna nicole smith : hot looks , feels great , but not something you want to have around day in and day out
to be sure , it is one of the radios you will find , but as a shortwave receiver , it lacks a lot : doesn not tune the whole sw spectrum ( why these radios just don not cover the full 1
7- <NUM> mhz range is beyond me ) sensitivity leaves a lot to be desired , and selectivity ( ability to separate stations ) is in adequate
plus , the audio is on the tinny side
for the $80 or so bucks you will normally pay for this , you can do much better
probably grundig is worst model .
jr music and amazon must be kidding to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a used product
to bury the fact that this item is "reconditioned" at the very bottom of a description instead of in the title or first line is deceitful ! they are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it .
beauty is deceiving
the worst thing about this radio is that the plastic on/off button will be rendered useless after one trip to the beach
get near a grain of sand and it will cause the button to stick
keep it inside the house and it is a marginal radio at best , and confusing to use
the plastic body is very cheap as well and seems to disolve when it gets near sun tan lotion
thousands of these must be sitting in drawers , silenced by the elements ! junk
that is why so many ended up in the bargain bins at retailers .
i have had a couple of these radios
for the most part i have been really happy for many years
its great for a simple transistor radio type sound quality
i am not a person so i cannnot comment on that feature
fm and am reception are terrific in orlando
battery life is great too
i have had <NUM> of these over <NUM> years
the first model was used reliably for <NUM> years
<NUM> of those years were in the bathroom exclusively
i finally wore out its am/fm/sw selector by sliding it back and forth between am talk and fm stations daily 10s of times
at that point i bought a second
this second model had suede inside its leather cover and a cheap shinyish silver finish
the buttons felt cheap and it ran for about <NUM> months and completely died , no audio , no readout , dead
the model appeared to be the same but quality was aweful compared to what i had before
i then sought an older , smooth leather interior covered model through ebay
it has functioned perfectly for the last few years on a high humidity bath windowsill .
the best looking radio in the world , you will love it no matter what
handsome little machine .
i bought this grundig porsche radio at staples a number of years ago when they were getting out of the product line
i wasn not even shopping for one
i grabbed it in a bargain bin for $25 since it had no box , no manual , no accessories , and was a display model , although it spent its time behind a case
unimpressive performance with very poor signal resolution , awkward volume control which forces you to open the leatherette case to get to this slide control ( dumb ! )
i have stacked it up to both more expensive radios that i own and less expensive ones ( ccradio2 , kaito ka009s , radio shack optimus pll , midland er102mo , two table radios - bose wave radio , and kloss tweeter label )
it comes in last every time
for local powerful radio stations it works fine ( but then so does a crystal radio with a short antenna
) challenge it a bit and its good looks get annoying really fast
use it for shortwave and you will find yourself shopping for something , anything that can pick up any but the most obvious and strong sw transmissions
if i had paid any more for it , i would consider it to be as valuable as an old brick
reviews on [
] , a site dedicated to dxing and ham radio operators , place this unit dead last amongst the significant numbers of receivers reviewed
( 1
8 points out of 5 ) stay away unless you can get it for a few bucks used or on clearance and already know that what you are going to listen to is am , powerful , and not likely to challenge the tuner end .
i have been a shortwave buff and radio collector for many years
i have a large collection of radios
grundig over the years has made many good products , however , the g2000a is certainly not one of them
i will concur that it is beautifully designed , has nice leather case and the fm section sounds decent
the am and sw sections are practically useless
lots of interference and noise
only can pick up strong signals and i have experienced fading on those stations
dxers should pass it by !
i have had my radio for about six months now and i could not be happier
it pulls in stations from all over the globe <NUM> hours a day
it is easy to use and extremely reliable
i recently took it to mexico with me so i could keep up on u
news and it provided me with several u
i love this radio .
this , along with the sony are among the two best portable shortwave radios offered by amazon at this time
both have their advantages and it is up to the user what is most important
the grundig is a fairly easy to use radio that allows the user to punch in the desired frequency , enter it into one of <NUM> memories , or scan desired bands to find a station of interest
the grundig is best asset is its great audio
it is definitely the best audio i have heard from a shortwave portable and makes listening a real pleasure
if you live or travel to any part of the world other than europe or eastern north america the grundig is the best you can buy
if you live in one of those two places consider the sony , which has a synch
detector that allows you to reduce interference from adjacent stations
this is important in areas where there are a high number of strong stations crowded next to one another
in any case , both are well worth the money .
i have been collecting radios for a couple of years now , and own over <NUM> ( at last count )
they range from old am table radios to early transistors to the latest and greatest
let me tell you what i think about the grundig : strong points : 1 ) quality
it doesn not feel cheap when you pick it up
2 ) good sensitivity across all bands
3 ) nice , full sound from the internal speaker
4 ) accessory package includes a good quality soft case , ac adaptor , earphones , and 23' compact sw antenna5 ) the ability to switch tuning increments to help fine tune in a station
points : 1 ) only <NUM> presets
i don not need 200 , but it would be nice to be able to separate them into "folders" for am , fm , sw
2 ) battery life is acceptable , but definitely not exceptional
i usually plug in the ac adaptor because of this
3 ) i wish it had a rotary tuning and tone ( bass/treble ) knobs
why ? i just like them
4 ) the backlight is very weak -- a poor choice of led isi know a lot of people find ssb reception to be important , but i rarely use it
as often as not , i like to just tune around the sw bands at night and see what i can find
sure is interesting to hear the viewpoint that other parts of the world have about the us
i am a radio fan , not a radio geek
i just like to play around with radios that are easy and fun to use and sound good
if you are like me , i will bet you will like this radio
if you are a geek , you may have more bones to pick with it , but on that i really cannot comment .
the good stuff : -bfo for tune in <NUM> khz very good sound through phones ( if you have good ones ) -very good sound with built in stereo through good am/ sw with whip ant
-handy reel ant
-very good owner is manual with frequency guide for ameteur , aironautical , and maritime
-nice very well with good quality feel to it
things that bug me , but not too much : -bass and treble would be nice , but if not can not we at least have a tone knob ? not even the famed sony <NUM> has one ! why not ? the hi/low switch is better than nothing , and does an ok job
-no rf gain control
two way dx/local switch tune knob just up and down buttons , so it is a bit of a pain to band scan
push push push push push push push
can tune in <NUM> khz steps
-bfo only
no usb/lsb
tunes in <NUM> khz steps with bfo "fine tune" knob
still ok for ssb , just could be better
-no sync detector
hay , what do 'ya want for that price ? -cheezy "earbud phones"
then again , did you ever get a decent pair of headphones with anything ? not me
spend a little and get some koss "" phones
you will never go back to cheap ones again ! -dial light only stays on for <NUM> sec
don not let all of this talk you out of one though
what it does it does well
all in all : a fine little radio esp
for the $
quite good sound with the speaker , and very very good through phones
good mw/am dx ( not a <NUM> or but , still a lot better than you might think )
good with just the whip ant
for sw
very good fm
i think it is by far the best radio you can get for the money
grab one while you can still get a new one
8 )
i have had this for a week and it is the best radio i have ever owned
it is portable and fits very ergonomically friendly into you hands
there are <NUM> memory presets
the big shortwave broadcasts ( bbc , radio canada , voice of america ) came in very clear and those are really the only ones worth listening to on a regular basis as most of shortwave is flooded with religious programming and politically slanted news
fm reception is very good and am is about as good as my other radios
the dial light and lcd readout could be stronger and bigger
it comes with an adaptor
sleep timer and alarm works just fine
has two times ( for gmt/utc and local time )
it looks great with its platinum case
i highly recommend this
it costs more but if you love radio and want bbc and voa , this is the one to get .
this is a great radio
it arrived on time
it is everything it said it was and more
i would recommend this radio to everyone
this is my second grundig and i enjoy them both .
i have many shortwave radios around the house and use them primarily for easy access to many regular am and fm stations
i use a sony sw7600g ( black version ) as a clock radio because it only has <NUM> presets per band
it is how you switch the stations that is important and the yb400pe requires you to key in two digits plus the enter key to change stations--if the memory preset is two digits , why do you have to press enter ? the sony takes one keystroke ( granted , though , the new sony doesn not do this either )
surely if you are looking for programs on the same shortwave frequencies this is useful , but the frequencies change so much i always use the wrth and ptwbr books and never use the presets
the sound is much , much better than the sony
it has deep bass and clear sound for both speech and music
aside from choosing memory presets , this radio would be more perfect if it had synchronous detection where the carrier is discarded and a sideband is used for better audio
the sony has this and it completely removes interference form rfi sources like computers and fluorescent lamps
bandscanning is okay if you don not mind the muting every time the frequency changes ( some people call this "chuffing" )
the automatic seek stops on the noisiest frequency , not just one with a carrier
the radio is made in china and has been as eton recently
i have one of the models but i wonder how much better the old taiwanese version was
*edit* after about four years of daily use the sound has finally deteriorated
i notice that after about two hours' operation something overheats and the sound becomes muddy and distorted .
do not buy
my father bought a new yb400 for me for a graduation present in 1995
i have never been able to pick up any sw station
i am in colorado now , 100km away from the high power time stations , and i can not pick them up
just hear buzzing noises
nothing on lw either
am ( mw ) reception is poor but it does get some stations
this was really expensive to turn out to be an fm clock radio
the fm reception is good , the clock works fine , the light is nice
equivelent to a nice $20 radio for <NUM> times the price .
i have had this radio for <NUM> years
it has worked well and has good sound quality as well as very decent shortwave performance for the price
pros : great value for price and i recommend the purchase if you want a good shortwave radio with stereo fm capability
the cons which follow would not prevent me from making this purchase again
cons : the packaging is ( injection molding plastic fit/finish and design ) is poor and much like a product that costs $20
it has not failed but just leaves a bad taste compared with japanese competition
what is worse is the legend for the features that one would use in low light conditions such as alarm is medium blue against black , small letters
they can not be read easily in normal light , much less normal household lighting
the logic is typically german
like my <NUM> vws
they seem to do things in a way that is different from anyone else and thus it is not intuitive without reading the manual
again , if it is a seldom used feature
also , a tone control instead of a switch would have been nice as well a ability to charge batteries while plugged in .
i have had the opportunity to compare the grundig yb400pe to several premium radios , the tivoli pal , the sony icf sw35 , the grundig s35 , the sangean 505 , and the kaito 1102
how does it rank ? it ties for second with the aforementioned radios for fm
first place goes to the kaito 1102
for am , it takes a tie for last place with the sangean 505
even the reception strength meter shows a weak signal for <NUM> am , a major los angeles station
in contrast , my kaito 1102 is meter shows "full strength" in its signal
and you can hear a huge difference too
the yb <NUM> does have a good speaker , clear and adequate for a radio its size , but it is not exceptional
i'd give the nod to the kaito 1102
since the kaito <NUM> is similarly sized and is fifty dollars cheaper than the yb400 , i say it is a no brainer : get the kaito 1102 .
great sensitivity and sound in a small radio
very simple to operate
it is to be compared with the sony 7600g , in choosing a portable , its chief competitor
you can not go wrong with either one
the yb400 audio is much better than the sony , and the operation is easier than the sony
the interference rejection however is better in the sony because of the sony is synch detector , if interference of strong stations is a consideration , or if ``selective fading , '' common on shortwave or twilight am broadcasting , where the carrier fades below the sidebands causing distortion , is a problem
this is also solved by synch detection
if distance daytime am listening is desired , the sony with its fast agc is better than the yb400 with its slow agc , because you can add a mw loop ( , terk loop , or radio shack mw loop ) and tune it successfully with a fast agc
it is difficult to tune with the yb400 is slow agc , though sometimes you can turn the switch to local and disable the agc temporarily to do it
( slow agc gives you an edge in copying interfering morse code stations , however , because the louder station won not modulate the weaker one on the yb400 , and it will on the sony
) for strong stations , pick the yb400 for the audio
for interference or am distance listening with a mw loop , pick the sony .
this radio is easy to use , and sounds great
coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good
you also get sideband tuning , which you will need if you want to hear ham radio operators
off the built in telescoping antenna i get more strong stations than i have time to listen to
with the supplied aux
antenna , reception is noticably improved
it comes with headphones , ac adapter and the aux antenna
it also has am and fm reception
fm is stereo with the headphones , and is very good quality
it has <NUM> built in clocks ( believe me , you want that ! ) <NUM> memories , and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling
this could be considered an entry level radio , but it is sensetive enough that you won not "out grow" it for a very long time .
this is one of the best portable radios out there
it has great shortwave reception ! the f
and a
both have great sensitivity and selectivity ; the ability to pull in weak stations next to strong ones
the only reason i don not give this radio <NUM> stars is because of the telescoping antenna
i have been through <NUM> radios because the antenna becomes lose and breaks after a long period of use
other than that this would be a perfect radio .
hello radio lovers ! i have a vast collection of radios and many many years of radio listening and purchasing experience i can do accurate compares which many find helpful
when i purchased this radio i so wanted it to be great like the old days of grundig
its not bad , but i wouldn not go out of my way to reccommend it over others
the sony sw7600gr and the sangean ats909 are much better buys
here is why , first off the grundig yb400pe is generally not made very well
the poor quality of the body , the antenna and the sound are obvious upon first look and listen
the tuner sensativity on fm is good but am and sw are fair
the side band set up is ok , others are better
one draw back is that it takes <NUM> aa batteries while the others take <NUM>
this makes the radio very heavy for its size
true that the sangean <NUM> and the sony <NUM> are a little more expensive but worth it
you are getting a more durable radio with a much better tuner and better sound
so i guess to sum it up its not that this radio is so bad its that the others in its class are so good .
while i am not exactly a shortwave hobbyist i have used shortwave radios on every one of my travels overseas
that being said the yb <NUM> pe is the best sw i have ever had
this grundig brings a lot of features to the table such as digital tuning , forty presets , great capture of stations and above average sound
i have really enjoyed using the <NUM> and its great features
one complaint i had was that the manual that accompanies it does an inadequate job of explaining some of the functions and the are all inclusive , that is it is forty for all bands fm/sw/lw/mw rather than per band
but these are small things that shouldn not take away from the overall excellence of the radio
i am getting ready to go on an extended trip to the third world and the grundig yb 400pe is at the top of my packing list .
briefly , the fm and am reception are very good for the grundig yb 400pe radio
sw is decent and ssb is fair , at best
the controls and display for the grundig are good , too : ergonomically , the choices made by grundig were sound and better than much of the competition
which is to say , the buttons and controls are easy to master in comparison to similar kaito and sony models
the sony is a better unit , i have to say , but the audio on the grundig is much preferable to the sony
overall , i would take the sony , but the grundig is a good portable radio and i would not be disappointed if i were on a desert island with just a grundig yacht boy 400pe as company
well done .
bought the camera , and by late june was covering a national convention requiring daily uploads to webpages
got rave reviews of the images shared
the usb connection is easy and fast
i found it handled indoor shots without flash with outstanding resolution
it has also produced some excellent outdoor shots , including some sky photography ( sunsets ) that rival film versions
one does not need to employ the top setting to produce extremely good pictures , maximizing the number of photos on a single compact flash card
it came complete with a set of rechargable batteries and charger - a nice feature
and the amazon price is at least $100 less than any other source ! this would be a perfect camera for a person just starting into digital photography , who wants a camera that looks , feels , and acts like a familiar <NUM> mm point and shoot and who has elementary knowledge and sense of computers .
this was my first and only digital camera that i purchased as a display item will i was working at compusa
if i remember correctly , at the time this camera was over $300 but i got it for $50
i have no idea how old this camera was when i bought it , but despite that , it lasted an additional <NUM> 1/2 years before it stopped working ; the battery connections went bad
i took it apart to see if i could fix it , but to no avail
the 1
3 megapixels was more than sufficent for me , it took crystal clear pictures everytime
i really enjoyed the lcd screen that showed in real time what the lens was looking at before you shot the picture
it also had a usb slot where you could easily tranfer the pictures to your pc
my only compaint about the camera was that the picture snapping was not instantaneous
this camera felt sturdy and built with quality materials
this camera had been dropped a few times , but it still functioned without any problems
i have taken thousands of pictures on this camera , not to mention the possible thousands that were taken before i came to own it , and i have been thourghly suprised with the durablity and quality of this camera
after my dc240 finally met its demise , i was dissapointed to find that kodak no longer made cameras like this , instead they make these plastic , cheap looking , cheap feeling cameras that feel no way as sturdy as the dc series
i purchased a dx model a few months after this one died and took it back the next day because i was very dissapointed in the quality of the camera
to this day the dc240 has been my only digital camera and i haven not had one since
i will have to turn to ebay to get something from the dc series , because unfortunately companies no longer make them like they used to .
i really like mine
it takes good pictures
it was easy to get started with it
do not try to buy a small camera bag for it because the lens cover will come off easily and you may accidentally turn it on when putting it into its bag
i highly recommend the usb disk reader , makes things a lot easier
with that reader you may not need the battary charger unless you want a slide show on your tv
note that the kodak <NUM> is offered here
[it] is probably more value
but , you will have to buy accessories so [it] will become a bit more after its all done
i can not say too much about how the pics print because i have been using it exclusively for internet images
i am having fun with mine .
i bought the kodak dc240 partially on a whim
i had read reviews of the kodak digital cameras and decided to check the price on amazon -- which was about right
the camera came a few days before i went to a convention in philadelphia , giving me enough time to learn how to use the camera
the pictures are wonderful , and my collegues were amazed that i could show them the pictures immediately , or delete them if the shot was bad
i also did a few shots using the timer , which worked pretty well
following the convention , i was able to put together a quick web site with the pictures , a faster process than waiting for the film to be developed , then scanning the pictures , then cropping , etc
overall , a good combination of features , ease of use , and quality pictures .
this is the best camera i have seen for the price
it has tons of features
i would highly recommend getting a compact flash card reader , so you don not drain your batteries on the camera xfering
also the kodak batteries are the best i have ever used
i would recommended getting the <NUM> hour rapid charger kit , you will get another set of batteries and be able to charge one set and use another .
i thought is was a flat wound cable or something , but it is just a regular cable and overpriced at that .
if you want solid , well constructed cable that you are never going to have to think about again then belkin is for you
i have never had one problem .
if you are not used to working with wires and lengths , i'd suggest measuring something and testing it out on your setup
even at <NUM> feet it seemed shorter than i thought it would be
luckily my computer sits right next to my router so i didn not have issues there
it was great to move away from my previous wireless connection to a wired connect
also makes it easier to troubleshoot the network when it is acting buggy .
i like belkin products and need a patch cable to run from my wireless modem to my laptop it fits just right and snaps in tight
perfect for small jobs where you don not need all that extra cable
i got two just because they were so cheap .
for the price , whats not to like ? it works as well a more expensive ones and i haven not noticed any problems at all .
most of the review is copied and pasted from another review i did for a belkin ethernet cable , this one being used in the same manner
this shorter one was exactly what i needed for the space in which it is being used
i don not know what else to really say about this , or any of the many belkin cables i have bought from amazon , except that they work very well for my requirements
this specific one is being used in my home theater system to connect a component to a switch box
it did not need to be pulled through any walls or stressed in any other way , but it is been fine for my use of it
some people think they are not the best of quality but i have not ever had any go "bad" or break or not fit correctly
you *can* get cables even cheaper than these from belkin , but i don not trust them
the belkin cables here on amazon are still far cheaper than what i have seen in stores , and i refuse to let instant gratification make me spend too much for something like this !
i needed a cable shorter than <NUM> feet
the 1' cable i had was too short
the snagless feature is really useful since i have a tangled nest of cables under the desk - disconnecting and will not be a problem .
good value for a lan cable
works as intended and the color is a breath of fresh air compared to the dull white or popping blue
can not beat this deal
( if you can , be sure to let me know ) .
needed a short cord to reduce clutter between my router and a switch
wanted a reliable brand name ( belkin ) cord with quality connectors
this one looks well built
only shortcoming is that it is cat 5e ( 350 speed ) vs cat <NUM> ( 500 speed )
didn not see a <NUM> foot one in cat <NUM> but the price for the cat 5e was very fair .
this was bought after we bought <NUM> new laptops that needed wireless and my desktop isn not ! just the right size for me to connect to the router ! ~
as my modem sits right on top of my computer , a three foot cable was the best length for my needs so as to minimize cable clutter behind the computer
connectors fit fine with reliable connections
have cycled connectors numerous times in order to break the computer connection on web sites which cause browser to freeze so these can apparently handle cycling without reliability problems
this was important as i have had the plastic latch fail on other cat5 cables from plugging / unplugging .
i know it is a silly thing to say about a cable , but i love the color of it ! it is difficult to get to the release latch to unplug the cable when it is hooked into the back of a 360 , but otherwise it is just what i was looking for
it works fine for system link , as long as your monitors are close enough together
: )
i bought these belkin cables
they are very nice quality
they seem heftier than a lot of the other cables
my system analyst neighbor mentioned that he prefers to buy the <NUM> foot roll
he runs them to wall outlets , then uses the <NUM> foot or <NUM> foot snap in cable from the wall to the pc
that way , you don not have to buy a <NUM> dollar crimping tool
you can not solder these cables
they require a metal to metal contact , and doesn not qualify
also , it is critical to keep them spiraled , all the way up to the end
even when attaching , instructions call for twisting them right up to the connection
since the tech instructions , tell you to keep them down to under <NUM> feet , these cables , whether they are long or short , are in the right lengths
i know amazon doesn not print prices in their reviews , but they have the local major chain office supply stores beat hands down
the <NUM> foot roll was half again as much locally
these are the category 5e cables
they give you a better return feed , which results in better overall performance
so insist on 5e instead of just 5
i initially bought some wall plates from ( a nation wide electrical supply store ) that were category 3 , then i returned those for the snap in option category 5
those were returned also , when i went to ( a nation wide building supply center )
( of all places to go networking ) and they had the complete leviton line of 5e accessories
if i had to do it over again , i would still buy the belkin <NUM> footers
i don not want to have a <NUM> foot roll of ethernet cable hanging around
these are tops
gold plated connectors , snag free ends , that protect that little lock in tab on the ends
you know the frustration of unsnarling a phone wire , out of a wiring mess , and the little tab bends over backwards , never to work properly again
well belkin built twin arches over the sides to prevent just that
way to go
highly recommended , good stuff , for a good price .
i have to give belkin credit ; the cable really does appear snagless
i used this short cable to connect an apple tv directly to router
i try to avoid wireless when i can , but this cable had to fight for space among a clutter of cables through a small access panel in the back of the entertainment center
the texture of the cable is insulation , coupled with the cable is supple flexibility , made it easy to snake the cord through the tangled mess
the connection is solid and secure , and the locking tab on the connector has a shield to help prevent accidental disconnections
i have had no troubles with the quality of the connection , and the apple tv transmits a signal every time
at this price , the cable is a bargain
for some reason , i have seen cat <NUM> cable of this length sell for more than $25
00 in stores ( and one time i had to pay the extortionate price because i was in a pinch )
you can purchase this cable secure in the knowledge that you are going to get a quality product .
it is a network cable , what can i say ? it works lol
it would be nice if it had the little cover over the removal prong , but it is no big deal .
this product works as advertised , i use it to connect my apple time capsule to a nother component and it did just fine
initially i went to a chain box store and purchased a <NUM> foot cat 5e
the price was $14
then they pushed an extended warranty
needless to say i returned it once this one arrived
pay $1
66 or $14
99 ? that is a no brainer .
now , i will admit i didn not strip it down and count how many twists per foot , but this blue three foot belkin cable is just about all you can expect from a functional blue 3ft piece of with molded plugs
yup , shore is !
it is a cable
it was nicely made , worked/works just fine
it wa slong enough to get where i needed .
good enough price , nice ends , good sheathing , not too stiff .
i have these connected to my server , computers , switch and nas server
nice short cables so i don not have so much mess around
seem like high quality , and they work
what more can you ask from a cable ?
i find belkin cables to be fine for their purpose
i am not sure how you should rate the length of the cord , after all , you buy the length you need ! the quality is fine and the price reasonable
( wish i could say the same about their electronics though
- but that is a different set of reviews sometime
should have copied my comments from the other cat 5e cable i endorsed
high quality product , fair price and reliability are the reasons i chose this product .
this cable was very well described came on time and i was very pleased with it would recommend it to anyone
i use this to connect my cable box to my router so that i can have a stronger connection in my room and it still works great ! remember , though , that it is a cable , and be sure to keep that in mind when ordering
<NUM> feet was just enough for me , so just be careful !
good for short jobs , like connecting my nearby printer to my network switch , which is itself connected by a very long ethernet cable to the router down the hall in another room
go go belkin !
bought to connect dvr to wall plug in , ordered with <NUM> ethernet cable , so price was a factor
saved $$ buying it online versus the store where it was $14
00 .
these short cables are perfect for use over the desk , without making a mess
i have a small switch where i connect two laptops and one raspberry pi , and long cables would make too much clutter
these cables work perfectly fine in my 100mbit network , and should also work witn a gigabit network ( not tested )
overall i am very happy with this purchase .
it is a short ethernet cable ( only needed it to run between my router and a device practically next to it ) it works like an ethernet cable should ( relatively ) cheapthe snagfree design is better than i have seen on many others
it doesn not cover the tab itself making it hard to release like other cables
i found it quite neat that it just has guards on both sides of the tab that extend a bit past the end of it so that things can not ( easily ) snag on the tab and still be very easy to depress when you want to disconnect the cable .
great cable , super cheap
i got it for less than $2 as an add on
can not beat hardwiring game consoles .
this item was well made as one would expect
performed well
used to connect ethernet switch box to computer modem
this in turn connected my computer and several online entertainment consoles
did the job .
i mostly use this in hotel rooms and it is been nice having the short cable
it is flexible and the ends make a nice connection
i think with normal use this cable will last me a long time .
this is a great product for connecting a switch and a router or modem
the connectors are very high quality .
good qualtiy with connectors
extremely useful for connections between router and other equipment
purchased three cables
very satisfied !
it is a <NUM> foot cat <NUM> cable that lets my router talk to my switch
no complaints
well i have one
it doesn not clean or cook dinner .
it is nice to have color coded cables in order to keep track of what goes where
i recently rewired my office and have now everything , and it is making things much easier
it is nice to know the external network drive is purple , and the networked printer is yellow , etc .
im very happy with these cables , i used them for connecting my home theatre to the net via a switch i installed in my entertainment center
the wires are made of high quality materials and seem to be working great so far .
inexpensive , but seems to be of good quality
i was looking for a mix of different length cables , and these fit the bill for some short patch cables into my ethernet switch , keeping all my devices happy ! good service from amazon .
this ethernet cable is the perfect length to connect my surround sound receiver to my home network
it works perfectly and is much less expensive than any offerings from local stores .
needed a short cat5 cable to hook up a tv from a router and this fit the bill perfectly
cable is good quality and works perfectly fine .
this cord is priced great and is of great quality ; something that can be pretty much assured when your buying a belkin product
i was looking for cat 5e cables to replace my older cables and decided based on the reviews on amazon and the price that this would be a great purchase
i don not regret it
the cable is of good quality and the completely snagless ; so much so , that it will take you a couple seconds longer to unplug the cord from whatever peripheral or computer it is hooked into
this was actually frustrating for me when i was troubleshooting my router , but then became a plus when i realized how easily the other cable would come undone with just moderate tension on the cord
so , the snagless is great if you plan on leaving it hooked into one device for any extended length of time , but not so great if you plan on constantly hooking and unhooking it from your device ( in this case , it is probably more convenient to get a "snagging" one
otherwise known as
a regular rj45 cable )
i can imagine someone with a laptop using a wired internet connection fussing over this feature
oh yeah , the length of this cord is a beautiful thing
i got so tired of having all this excess cord hanging out the back of my devices that i was thrilled when i discovered this on amazon
i had no idea they made the lengths of the cord this short , so , that was actually the deciding factor for me
i am happy with this purchase .
very nice set of wires , i love my purchase
better then the ones you buy in 99c
i bought <NUM> of them .
i really thought about buying a crimper , cable , and ends but after adding up the cost it was cheaper to just buy premade cables since i didn not need very many
this cable works fine for my needs .
does what i need it to , which is primarily to be a quick disconnect between a coupler and my pc when i don notwant to be online .
used it for my other computer that was just sitting around
works perfectly and seems very durable
cable could be longer though .
needed a new patch cable and this one was a good buy and works like a charm
no problems with this order .
outside skin appears to be good
ends are solid and pretty well put together
color makes it distinguishable from other cables
skin is obviously thin and would not work outdoors or exposed to weather .
these 3ft cables are perfect for any networking task
purchased these to replace the <NUM> foot ethernet cables taking up all the space in my computer room
using these nice short cables , i connected my routers and modem all together much more neatly than i had done using the longer cables
bottom line : these work as they should
been using them for about a year with absolutely no problems or complaints .
pro : it worked , it is blue and matches my linksys routers , what more can you say about a cable ? came in a pretty package : - ) using in a power over ethernet ( poe ) application
cons : none
i have used this cable to connect a wifi router to a lan net and even with regular unplugging and plugging for thunderstorms it has given me no trouble and always supplied a reliable connection .
my modem sits right on top of my desktop tower so i needed the smallest ethernet cable i could find and this was it ! superb !
got several of these <NUM> foot rg45 cat <NUM> patch cable to hook up the connections on my home network distribution panel
i like these over the stiffer and inflexible yellow patch cables which were way too long
these are just the right length and much more flexible to route it around the 19&<HASHTAG> ; distribution frame .
this is a typical cat5 cable - nothing special or fancy , but it works
it seems more durable than other crap ones i have used just in that the locking tab that holds it in the jack hasn not broken off after extensive use .
my ethernet wire broke
( the wire i used to connect my verizon modem to my linksys router ) so i got this one and it works fine
i would have liked them to specify "ethernet" in the description cause i am not familiar with the terminology and wasn not sure it was the same wire i had that needing replacing
i finally looked up cat5e on the web and found a site that called it an ethernet wire so i came back here and bought it .
works as good as any cable you can buy in your local store , just at a much cheaper price .
this was exactly the length i needed from my modem to my router
it is been perfect since i received it
internet hasn not disconnected once
it is hard to gush about a cable , but this was the right amount of cable for a short run , and it worked fine , and the price was good
you have to order it as an add on with something else to make the shipping work .
came on time and the cable works just fine .
nothing fancy here , just a well made product
the price is right and it works flawlessly
i will buy again
with no wireless where i work , a cable is required to use the internet
this is the best buy i found
i had problems finding a cable not wanting cable all over the desk
what i found was $10+ elsewhere , this is the best buy
yes , it works without any problems .
whats blue- 3' long and filled with bits of wire- yeah , stupid joke but this thing works as advertisedyep
this ended up being alot shorter than what i needed but i am sure i will find some use for it in the future , very nice looking and well put together
this is a quick fix for a small cable problem
fast service to repair a cable connection that was broken .
i needed a patch cable , and this one is great quality
the price on amazon is a fraction of what you will pay for this same item at best buy .
works just fine , nice blue color , and no trees in the rain forest were used in the manufacturing of the product
not much else to say .
i bought these a while ago just to bump up my overall purchase to the $25 ( at the time ) minimum to receive free shipping
not an exciting purchase , but functional as i bring up more devices between my patch panel and main switch .
i will make this short and fast much in the same way this cable works
first and foremost : it works and works well
it may be only be <NUM> feet long and that is totally my fault but it fits exactly as i need it
if i were lucid when i measured the location i would have chosen a longer cord and had a little extra but for what i needed at the time and now the length is perfect
i have a virtual cable factory behind my electronics and when making any changes it is a nightmare because it seems as if everyone will get hung up at the connector but not this belkin
it is snagless and that is fantastic for the lazy or impatient
those elements alone would be worth buying this cable ; however , when the value is added in this is a fantastic buy and i highly recommend it under any circumstances that work .
its a cable
it worked
it was long enough
should of made my own but customer wanted blue
two more words .
the product was what i expected and the price was the main reason i made the purchase
i have never gotten a bad wird yet knock on wood .
good quality , low price and the cables worked as expected
that is all you can as for from a network cable .
i needed short cables to connect my home theater devices to a single ethernet cable by way of a ethernet &<HASHTAG> ; &<HASHTAG> ;
these cables fit the bill nicely and the quality is good
local stores charge much more money for 6' cables which would be an expensivecable eyesore .
this ethernet cable isn not long and it isn not fancy
however , it has a solid build quality and should last you for years
great for running in between a router and a closet computer !
the merchant got this cat 5e cable to me quickly
it is well built , doesn not kink , and i like blue
great .
i bought this for my onkyo receiver which required a direct connect internet connection to receive the dozen or so channels available ( xm , pandora , rhapsody , etc
it is of good construction and looking ( color ) and adds some fun to my otherwise mundane system layout
live it up and try come of the colors available
since using daily i have not had a problem at all
arrived on time , well packaged , and as i ordered
solid good product .
with a box of over <NUM> cat <NUM> cables i have no idea why i bought this , i must have been drunk
also claiming a cord as snagless is a bit overboard , but those marketing exec is really know what they are doing at belkin .
does what it is supposed to do
thanks to everyone that takes the time to review products
it is a big help .
to reduce clutter behind the scene with colors to help color the herd gathering behind your electronic devices : )
does the job nicely , cable is high quality and easy to route
would buy a bunch more if i needed them .
well not alot to say on this
i bought this to connect my roku box to my router since they are only about <NUM> feet apart
its thin and not the best quality , but it works great
snagless means that the ends are protected from being snapped offwhile feeding the cord through holes or openings in your desk or entertainment center
it works
and well thats what matters most
so my opinion , to run an ethernet cord to a short distance , you can not get a better value .
i tried it on my laptop and it got stuck
i had to really tug , pull and work at it to get it out
i am not happy with it .
the cable length is what i was looking for and these are priced pretty more than well for what i needed .
i bought a few of these along with some 25 , 50 , and <NUM> ft cables as part of my home surveillance project a while back
there is very little that could impress you about a 3ft cable , but i will say that belkin , in general , provides great cat cable at extremely good prices
i am a belkin customer for life .
these are great for completing a distribution panel - long enough to reach from corner to corner but easy enough to coil if the connection is much closer .
ok , so it didn not disintegrate when i opened the package
the twisty ties were twisty and tied
the clips on both ends clipped properly
it did not break the first time i used it
it didn not break when i had to unplug and it
it fits most brands of cable management systems
and data flows through it nicely
i love it .
if you do wired networking , you will know that there is no such thing as too many patch cables
usually the ones you have are much too long - hence my seeking & ordering these shorter cables
certainly as good quality as any others ; and way way cheaper than i have seen in any retail store !
sturdy , takes being stepped on etc
the color helps me differentiate one line from another
good connections
what else is there ?
it worked for me , but then i pulled it out of a box of other cables
the plastic tip broke off because it caught on something , the other end was already broken
the ends must be quite fragile .
always great to get the right size when a longer one is unnecessary and unmanageable
belkin is products are very consistent in both quality and price
they hit it all with this one
we have used several of these at work .
best cable i have ever purchased
doesn not get all tangled like others do
should last longer than others i have purchased
will buy more as need arises .
we needed to hook two computers up to an ethernet switch box
this short cable was just the right size for the computer which sat next to the switch box
very sturdy cable , and the clips on the ends look like they will last a long time .
you can feel that this cable is made to last
it ahs durabel tips and they feel strong
this works well with all our needs .
it is a cable
it is three feet long and black
it worked exactly as described to connect my kenwood d710 head unit to the main body of the radio .
needed a new one
came brand new in packaging
works great
great buy for the money , great product , still use it today
patch cord was well constructed
perfect in patch panels and in home networks
rubber coating looks to be very durable .
like the title suggests , why would any comsumer want to pay more for a product that does exactly the same thing ? sure , there may exist purists that really believe a more expensive patch cable yields better signal delivery , but they will have a hard time convincing me of an iota of difference
belkin is a reliable name that produces a reliable product at a highly competitive price
i would buy , and will buy , these cables again and again .
this ethernet cable is a great value and works like a charm
had it for <NUM> years and have never had a problem with it .
i replace my cables every few years , my cable was going out so i placed it with this , things are working so much better now
sped up my internet connection by simply buying this cord
i had had no idea that the cord itself could make connection slow , and this was a bargain compared to getting a new modem
snagless , however , means that you will never again get it wrapped as tightly as it appears in the photo
this thing is fairly stiff and it likes to stay straight
just another in the coil of snakes on the back of the desk , but it is a very good cord .
purchased this to connect a switch to a <NUM> port router for extra expandability
there is not much to say here other than if you are looking for a short cable to keep cords clean then look no further .
littly pricy , but a great cable
you will plug this in and never get another , so why not get it ? you may want a longer one though , i just use this from my cable modem to my router .
does what it should , act as a patch cable for internet connection
i only needed a short cable , and isnt much more expensive to purchase this ready made one than terminating my own wire .
i needed only wee little cables to connect computers to switch and these are just the right size
handy to have the light blue , everything else is grey or black so i know which cable goes to what at a glance .
it is well made , soft flexible material instead of cheesy hard plastic
the length is about right for a patch cord .
for ethernet cables , i don not need fancy smancy cables to get the job done
these are good and very inexpensive .
a good quality cable at an affordable price
it has worked well for me and i would purchase additional cables of this brand .
its an ethernet cable
seems to work fine
have had no issues , and passes the signal like it needs to .
good quality and you can not beat the price
bestbuy gets about $25 for a similar cable
i would buy it again .
these do exactly what you need them to do ! what more can you ask for from patch cables ? great quality from belkin .
i have never bought a belkin product i wasnt satisfied with
this is no exception
not that i really give this cord any thought now that it is in use , but that is the point , isnt it ? i guess the only other thing to say , is that being blue , it is easy to find in the mass of cords around my tv and computer area .
not much to review here
item was as advertised and worked without problem
the plugs have a guard over the lever which helps keep the snap tab from breaking off .
well constructed cable , it is very flexible making it easy to run where you want it .
i recently ordered this ethernet cable due to mine being so old and long
this cable is the perfect size , works admirably and i received it within a week at a great price ! thx u so much ! as always i will continue to shop online at amazon in the future !
nice looking cat <NUM> cable and the length is perfect for most devices
i wish they made several different colors instead of white and black , then you could trace what port and what device it powers .
this is a simple cat <NUM> cord and inexpensive
it works great ! i would recommend it
i have has no problems .
i find it hard to say &<HASHTAG> ; i love it&<HASHTAG> ; about a network cable , but they are of fine quality , so they deserve a 5
<NUM> feet is pretty short - turns out , a little too short for my application - so be sure that is what you need .
it is a good cable
not much you can say about a ethernet cable
it works great
high quality build
i would recommend this cable to anyone .
hey it is an ethernet cable , these things either works or they don not
this one worked fine for me to connect to home router .
what you see is what you get
just your average cat5e cable
good for ethernet connections up to <NUM> feet .
great price for a genuine belkin cat5e patch cable ! the packaging is minimal , which is a plus , since it is just a cable
i ordered a few
they all worked perfectly .
i need a small cable to run from my tv to my zyxel wap3205 and this did the tick ! seam to be high qty i tend to like belkin products
you'd think all ethernet cables are the same , but after installing thousands of cables in my profession , you get a good intuition of what is good and what is not
these cables are certainly well made and reliable and an important part of any network
you won not have any issues with this one so stock up and don not worry about connectivity issues .
belkin rj45 cat 5e snagless molded patch cable ( blue ) worked just as it was i thought it would
pagkaged well and arrived on time .
cables showed up exactly like i expected them
packaged neatly and correctly
i honestly don not know what else to say , they are exactly as advertised .
this produce is well made is from a good company and works as stated very well
this item came in a very short timne and was all i had expected
most people will tell you a cable is a cable
after dealing with so many different brands , i have concluded that it is not true
this cable is very easy to manage on a patch panel
i am completely sold on belkin cables .
ethernet cables work very well with my xbox
they looks great and i hope the color of the items
thanks so much .
not a whole lot to say here
they are good cables , good price , and arrived quickly
i would recommend them to a friend .
if there is one thing i dislike about ethernet cords it is the price that some companies try to charge for them
i have , unfortunately , shelled out $20 for a <NUM> foot ethernet in the past thinking it was the price i had to pay
either this price is outrageous or the sellers online are crazy
after buying a switch for my college dorm room i needed an extra ethernet cord
since the switch box was about a foot from the ethernet plug i needed a small length , and <NUM> feet seemed adequate
this light blue cord is exactly what i needed and is listed at an exceptional $2
with amazon prime this is like spending the quarters you find in your couch cushions
i always recommend buying ethernet cords ( or <PERCENT> of products ) online
the deals are too good to pass up !
this ethernet patch cable works great
i have no problems with the signal running through it
it seems like a solid , well constructed cable
the cable i got is as specified in the product description .
i needed a cable to connect a new ethernet switch to a modem , and this fits the bill perfectly
just as described .
i love this patch cable it works great and better than the after market i had speed is faster and better shipment was fast thank for a great product
what more can you ask for but a high quality low cost ethernet cable
they work and i am happy .
very fast service
exactly what i ordered
i am never disappointed with belkin products
will use technology galaxy again
thank you .
i ordered these because most you find are <NUM> feet long and i don not want all that cable hanging everywhere because i have cats that will try to play with it and then all my equipment ends up on the floor
not now because since i found these on amazon they have not touched them .
what can i really say ? it is a standard cable
it seems to be well constructed and it works
there is nothing more to say .
it is a <NUM> foot ethernet cord
it works , it is blue , it gets <NUM> stars
i have to type a few more words to give it a review .
this cable is what it is
i needed some extra cabling to attach a computer to my ethernet hub and it works fine .
i ordered a longer version of this exact cable last year to connect my cable modem to my desktop computer
i was so impressed with the make and quality of it that when i bought a valet router , i decided the cat <NUM> cable supplied with it was not up to the standard i expected
i bought the <NUM> foot one to connect my router to the modem
i really wasn not expecting much as far as improved performance , but i am keeping a full wifi signal on my phone now , while previously only having <NUM> of <NUM> bars showing up
could be the shorter cord , could be better quality , i am not really one to say since i am no pro with these things , but it has improved my router is signal
one piece of advice , if you are using more than one get a different color
i wasn not thinking and prefer the blue cord , so i ended up with two blue cords that are going to the same product
since i do occasionally plug my modem directly into the pc instead of through the router , i ended up having to color a black mark on the one cord so i know which is which
the snagless feature on these works really well and was the biggest concern i had with the cable that came with the router since i could already see the clip starting to wear from unplugging it and plugging
wouldn not usually write a review for a cord , but this one has enough going for it that i think it deserves all the praise it can get .
this cord works great and the length is just right for me
my only complaint is that the orange isn not quite as festive in person
i thought it would be more neon , but it is actually the dingy orange that you sometimes see on really long extension cords
orange is my favorite color , so i paid a little extra for it , but i wish i had just gotten one of the cheaper ones .
good quality cable
i would recommend them to anyone looking for a good , cheap patch cable
i bought them to replace some home made cables , and they work perfectly .
this wire does the trick for my portable wifi router without having to lug around a long cable
the three foot length is just right !
i connect a long ethernet wire to 10/100mbps desktop switch which inturn uses <NUM> of these belkin ethernet cables to connect all my devices and they work perfectly
i connect my tv , xone and ps4 and all of them work at full speed .
plugs are not plated ( full plastic ) , which can causes mass problems
they do their job as expected for the rest .
i needed a few extra cat 5e cables to hook up some devices to my home network
i found these cables on here at what i thought was a ridiculous price , and though the price made me wonder would the things even work when i got then , i should never have worried
they worked like a charm
for someone like me who isn not going to buy a roll of cat cable at home depot and make my own network lines , these worked great
highly recommend !
not much to say about wire - it does the job
we use this to connect an upstairs computer with a downstairs printer .
it is a piece of cat5 with snagless ends
it is blue in color and approximately three feet in length
good for making short patch connections
nothing wrong with it at all i would purchase more if needed .
i saw the mixed reviews but went ahead and took a chance on this
i am happy to report that it was in fact <NUM> feet and works perfectly connecting my modem to my computer
the price was great the big box store wanted $25 for a <NUM> foot cord
this is a great value for a small space and it looks just like the picture
i recommend the product .
i just installed a network between my two home computers , and this cable did the job perfectly
it worked just like it is supposed to , and the 50ft length gave me all the cable i needed , with plenty left in case i decide to the desk locations
well worth the $10
99 price .
it works , it is snagless
perhaps with some high end test equipment i could find a flaw , but none are visible by me
five stars .
belkin is a classy company indeed
i am frequently plugging and unplugging my laptop from this cable and the tab that keeps the wire in the jack broke off after about <NUM> months of heavy use
went to their website , put a claim in and they mailed me out a new one the next day , no questions asked
update 8/08 belkin now makes a50ft cat6 black patch cable snagless rj45m/rj45mthat is better made , transmits data faster and supports <NUM> mbps networks and probably best of all is cheaper .
i bought these belkin cables
they are very nice quality
they seem heftier than a lot of the other cables
my system analyst neighbor mentioned that he prefers to buy the <NUM> foot roll
he runs them to wall outlets , then uses the <NUM> foot or <NUM> foot snap in cable from the wall to the pc
that way , you don not have to buy a <NUM> dollar crimping tool
you can not solder these cables
they require a metal to metal contact , and doesn not qualify
also , it is critical to keep them spiraled , all the way up to the end
even when attaching , instructions call for twisting them right up to the connection
since the tech instructions , tell you to keep them down to under <NUM> feet , these cables , whether they are long or short , are in the right lengths
i know amazon doesn not print prices in their reviews , but they have the local major chain office supply stores beat hands down
the <NUM> foot roll was half again as much locally
these are the category 5e cables
they give you a better return feed , which results in better overall performance
so insist on 5e instead of just 5
i initially bought some wall plates from radio shack that were category 3 , then i returned those for the snap in option category 5
those were returned also , when i went to home depot ( of all places to go networking ) and they had the complete leviton line of 5e accessories
if i had to do it over again , i would still buy the belkin <NUM> footers
i don not want to have a <NUM> foot roll of ethernet cable hanging around
these are tops
gold plated connectors , snag free ends , that protect that little lock in tab on the ends
you know the frustration of unsnarling a phone wire , out of a wiring mess , and the little tab bends over backwards , never to work properly again
well belkin built twin arches over the sides to prevent just that
way to go
highly recommended , good stuff , for a good price .
using this cable to connect my ps3 to the router , and it is working fine
i don not know my upload or download speeds , but playing movies off netflix and playing games online has been trouble free .
we got one spare computer table in the room and just <NUM> minutes ago i set up everything and works perfectly ! it is connected to our router in the living room and right now i am playing the music player on our xbox accessing my mp3 songs on this computer
so happy with this belkin ethernet cable
oh another thing , its wires aren not awkwardly bent like other cables after you remove it from its packaging .
the cable was just exactly the length i needed
the no kink feature is really nice
it worked very fine .
these where exactly what i needed for my player
the price was great and could not be beat at any store that i looked at .
if you just need to connect a router or switch , and don not want to bother about making your own cables , this is a great option
certainly pricey for what it is , but the snagless design is very solid and you won not have to worry about bad cables , as these are all for you
one small quibble is that the snagless housing makes for a big cable end , which could become problematic if you are plugging many cables into a small hub
otherwise , great .
cable is high quality , was shipped on time and packaged well
i have used cheaper cables but they are not as and durable as this belkin cable .
works fine
no problems with any of the connectors
packaging was fine when i received it
overall no problems and works to standard .
there is not much to say
this cable does the job intended and works just fine
considering the price , it is a great buy !
ita a cable it does what it supposed to do and does it good been doing it for a while now and hope keeps on doing seems like it like what its doing
while it seems silly to sit and glorify the merits of a cable , the belkin series of cables are truly great
i have a number of varieties of them , and they are all excellent - well made , work great , and the snagless aspect actually is qite good
good connectors that won not break soon , too .
i needed an extension that was not wireless so that i could reduce the buffering in downloading and watching movies and this does the job adequately .
i use it to run to my router and keep my family happy haha thank you for selling this item to me
i bought this to connect another pc to the router and this cable made installation easy
was able to run it from the router , through a floor hole , across the basement , and up through a hole near the additional pc with no kinks , twists , snags or curls
the pvc jacket is solid and thick for excellent protection and yet the cable remains flexible so i was able to bend it through some pretty tight spaces
big plus : the strain relief on the plug helps protect the locking tab from snapping off
the plugs fit into the jacks with barely any wiggle so it makes solid contact
( and i have had some bad experiences with cheapo plugs from other sources
i am looking at you , radio shack
) i like this cable and highly recommend it .
great quality cable , i wouldn not buy anything of a lesser quality and it has the stubs on the end to protect the connector that often breaks off .
i bought it to hook up my <NUM> to my computer
it works great and i did not have to spend $100
00 on a wireless .
this product works flawlessly and provides a great signal for my extended network system
i highly recommend this cable .
i snaked it through a wall
the ends held up just fine
my media pc has excellent internet connection through fios .
what can i say
it is cable
it is long , it is blue , it does its job and the price was right .
i'd not going to go nuts here - i mean , it is just a cable
but 50ft of cat5 at the oxymoronic 'best buy' would mean unloading your wallet , so $12 is a reasonable price and the cable has been working fine ever since .
this is just what it says it is
a good , moderate cost cable for joining parts of an ethernet network
the connectors are large enough to grasp easily and they are snag proof as you pull them around furniture , etc .
i bought this ethernet cord for my home network and it has worked flawlessly
not much else i can say
it works as you would expect it to , and the price is great .
works great , but i am not too sure what snagless molded patch means , but definitely able to hook my desktop into my router ! i wish they had black though .
i wanted to buy a good cable , not a cheap one and this one seems to be made well and is working good .
very sturdy , just what i needed since my pc does not like to &<HASHTAG> ; go wireless&<HASHTAG> ; all the time
i just keep it plugged in with this chord and all is good
and when my mac has issues with wireless , i can give it a turn .
i ordered both the belkin <NUM> ft cat 5e and the belkin <NUM> ft
cat 5e cables since i was not sure if the <NUM> ft cable would be long enough --- as it turned out the <NUM> ft cable was just what i needed so i did not use the <NUM> ft
the <NUM> ft cable comes in belkin packaging and markings but ( like other reviewers stated ) the <NUM> ft
cable comes in a plastic bag that says made in china and there is no indication that the cable is a belkin
i gave this <NUM> stars because it does not appear to be a belkin product --- i would give the <NUM> ft
cable <NUM> stars .
and now i have one
i tested it , tied to multiple connectors back to the source and it works perfectly , with no delays , etc .
used this to hook up wired router for 2nd computer
it is a quality product .
50ft for $9 ! what else needs to be said ? this cable is every bit as good as the $50 bundles you will see at office depot
i bought about <NUM> of these and every one of them works great
i have my home security system wired up on this particular cable
its a great buy , and i am a belkin customer for life now .
the cable worked , was able to negotiate a gigabit connection as expected
there is not much more to say
. .
priced right and worked flawlessly , i recommend this item for home networking and will use again in the future .
this cable was received neatly coiled with in a retail package
the connectors , which are already applied , will not loosen over time like manually pinned out cables will have a special design to protect the security clip from breaking off
this allows the rj45 connectors to fit firmly in place and not fall out of the network port
belkin is a recognized brand for premium cables
even though this is a name brand cable , the price was comparable to other similar cables making this purchase a clear best choice .
it is very blue and does not snag even if you try
i really like how blue it is and it also works well .
this cable says belkin on the box , but the protective sheathing is of a poor quality
<NUM> feet is a long length , and if the quality is poor , you can expect crimping , snaging , twisting , and a mangled mess
i bought this cable anyway
i used the cable for three weeks
i removed the cable after three weeks
junk after three weeks
all those who say -- maybe they only used it for a day
after they got paid for writing a glowing review , they junked it after <NUM> week
plan to junk yours too
hey , it is only your hard earned money
so what ? i cannot tell you how much it hurts me to write such a poor review
dam you , belkin .
good product and it does the job
and great price
seems to be very well made , just as most all belkin products are .
i have been using belkin cat5 cables for a long time
they come with a stamp and specs on the wire and the connectors have a belkin logo embedded in them
the one i received does not have the belkin name anywhere on the wire and the connectors
sure its a fake
if i had to buy any cat5e i could have spent only $10 including shipping
may be this fake cable works good , but the seller should not deceive people by saying its a belkin cable
buyer beware .
i opted for this one after reading reviews of some of the other cables made by other manufacturers
it is the cable ends that are usually of concern
the belkin cables are fine
the ends are very well made and snap into their sockets nicely
i have used it to hardwire an internet streaming box to my router
it is functioning just fine .
i am using several belkin patch cables along with this one
they all work as advertised , have a good design on the connectors and come with a lifetime warranty .
gotta put in <NUM> words , so what can i say , it is a pre made item , made by a great cable maker , so this thing will work great and it was a great price , usually stores are out to kill you on price so this fit the bill to connect two rooms together on my network .
works perfectly
great value
connecting internet modem to tv in living room via basement in order to use netflix/pandora
blue makes it easy to recognize what it is if we ever have to distinquish it from other lines .
they connect my cable modem to my router , and my router to my computers
they transmit data back and forth
so far they have failed to burst into flames or snap off and poke me in the eye
so go patch cables ( yay ) .
this 50ft cable is flawless , snagless , no more kinks in the cable
the connectors are nice and soft and i love the blue color
this cable works like a charm and well worth the price at 50ft length
highly recommended - cheaper than radio shack !
i needed a cable to go across my house , and this one did that job fine
i was really afraid i would have to pay a lot of money for a 50' cable , but this cable proved me wrong
it is not expensive (
the snagless connectors were very useful when i was dragging the wire under my floors ( though some tape probably could have done the job )
i have not noticed any loss in performance because of this cable .
cable worked great will buy again when i need another cable
very durable and works like it should
would recommend if you need a dsl cable
received these ( 2 ) quickly , packed well in belkin packaging
snaked thes thru walls and got a tight connection with nice signal strength
i needed the 50'
glad that i didn not go with my first assessment of 25&<HASHTAG> ; all was right with the ordering , packaging and delivery
ran from dsl router to computer and roku .
this cable is such a great price ,
that alone is a great reason to buy it
it helped me extend the distance of my signal , without the cost of having to buy a signal booster
have been using this cable for <NUM> months now with zero problems
ive got it running thru my apartment because our router is in my roommate is room
a quality cable that is reliable and dependable ! i love it !
prompt delivery
the extension cord allows me the extra length i sometimes need when i must be away from my desk while teaching and using my ipad .
i used this for a server i have running in a corner of the room away from my pc
i plugged this into one monitor port , and now i don not have to use a finicky remote control software to access the pc
the cable is good quality and provides a clear image of the screen .
great price and it did exactly what i needed it to do
if you need to make your cord stretch after rearranging some furniture this works fantastic .
i use this to have an extra monitor closer to my ham shack
it does the job but the screws don not reach the nuts so i only could plug the cord in and could not screw it in place .
ordered a few of these they work great
perform like the newest cables with out the cost
a true buy .
this was not the right cable i needed , so cannot give it a glowing report
returned it and bought the right hdmi cable .
my projector universal port adapter was only <NUM> ft long
this was an excellent addition
now my computer does not have to sit so close to the projector .
i need a male/female cable to use with a vga extender
i didn not realize until i received the cable that the fastening posts actually prevented the cable from connecting because any vga outlet would not accommodate that
i decided to take my chances with a hack saw and successfully ( and easily ) removed the posts from the female end
the posts are only needed if using as an actual extension to prevent the cables from being pulled apart
it worked great for my application .
 ? in this review i was asked to rate stars on this product is ease of use and sound quality - i have no idea why , as this is strictly a visual product
anyway - i use this male to female vga monitor extension cable to extend another 15' vga cable which connects my laptop to my 46" lcd tv
i would say i am very discerning when it comes to assessing audio/video quality and still feel the picture is nearly perfect
it does what it is supposed to , without any detectable degrading to the image quality or "noise
" the build feels solid and at the same time , not too rigid
i am very happy with this product
*update : this and the other cable i bought at the same time , 2
5 years ago , both seem to be working well
neither has seen heavy abuse , so i can not attest to it is , but in my home it still carries a strong , clear signal !
the screws to tighten the plug feel cheap , but the cable works just fine
i am using it for an old 17&<HASHTAG> ; monitor and the picture looks just dandy .
belkin isn not high in terms of consumer name recognition - but they produce a pretty wide range of products
cables to routers
i have never been disappointed in any of their products which deliver to value pretty dependably
this cable is another one of those products
a simple product ( vga extension cord ) - but it needs to work reliably
this cable was nearly the least expensive one available - and it works well / as expected with higher resolution
i'd buy as many more as needed without any regret or remorse .
i was looking for an extension for my 42"tv/monitor in the living room when i found this one i have bougth belkin products before and have had good luck with them this was a very good buy for the price better than going to the retail stores and buying there .
purchased to use second monitor on my pc
configuration of my setup required a longer vga cable
does the job perfectly !
the first two times i plugged this into my projector , it took a couple times unplugging and replugging to get it connected
now i can not get it to work at all
unfortunately , i had it over a month before i tested it , so now i can not return it .
if you have to run a legacy dos program , it is getting progressively harder to find these things
there is also the issue of a maximum length for a functional parallel cable before things start malfunctioning
this one works just fine , and is inexpensive , as well
( so how much more can one rave about a rather intentionally mundane object ? )
with my setup i have my printer and a zip drive running off the same cable , and since i bought this belkin cable i havent had any problems
it is also very easy to screw and onto the computer as it has different knobs than the standard printer cable .
this extra long ( 25' ) cable enabled me to relocate my printer to a more covenient location in my home office .
-- a cable ! i needed to connect my ancient ( but ) hp laser printer to my "modern" computers ( that still have a parallel port )
i'd considered using a cord , or a adapter ( converter ) , but some of these have reviews on this site , so i decided to go with this "older" solution
[rare mention of a out there , too ! ] the result is , i can now use the ( which still works splendidly ) with either of <NUM> desktops , or with my windows xp laptop
the proper drivers install quickly , and printing seems quick enough
-- in short : recommended .
this item is perfect for those of you who still have older hp workhorse laser printers
thick construction and super long cable .
worked perfectly to run from a desk , around a wall to an oki impact printer
not a single problem
typical great belkin quality .
paying ( little cash ) , i was not expecting a great deal of volume from this speakers
consider this , some cheap non amplified speakers cost near $15 dollars and for double that price , you would expect about double the quality
well , let me tell you , this baby more than the sound of those speakers
the creative labs pc works <NUM> system comes complete with the <NUM> satelitte cubes , the subwoofer , power adapter , audio inputer cable , mounting stands , velcro attachments and screws
installation was very easy , just plug the speakers in the back of the sub , plug in the power adapter in the power source and the audio cable in the sub and the source
the included manual is quite small but is adequate enough to help you set up and get the system running
they have recommendations on placement and volume
i plugged my system into a discman first
when i first turned it on i was amazed at the power of the bass
the oomphs really shocked me
concerning the volume , this is one of the problems i have with the system
first off , the volume is somewhat hard to find the appropriate setting
( there is a bass adjustmant on the sub and a volume control on the audio cable ) finding a balance in bass and treble is quite hard
when the bass level is at <PERCENT> ( as set when you first get the system ) , the bass tends to overpower the treble at lower volumes while the treble overpowers the bass at high volumes
solving this problems involves alot of tweaking and depends on the type of music you listen to
my second problem with this system is the supplied velcro strips
these were supposed to be used to mount to a wall
i was obviously skeptical at the concept but i tried it anyway
about <NUM> days after mounting them to the wall , on one of the speakers , the velcro pad unstuck from the speaker so the speaker fell
after it , almost a day later , the velcro pad stuck to the wall unstuck so the other speaker fell
after this happened , it is obvious that the actual sticking surface which attaches to the wall/speaker is too weak , not the velcro
if you decide to use the velcro , let the pads stick to the surfaces for atleast <NUM> days before mounting the speaker to the wall
those <NUM> problems are my only ones , other than that the volume is excellent
you will be suprised about the amount of volume you can get from this system
its hard to explain ,
hear the sound , you will be amazed
in conclusion , if you think about it , the cost of these speakers warrant it to be a typical speaker system for any computer and can easily be used for a small home theatre system
the speakers are magnetically shielded so you can mount them to your monitor
if you got extra cash and you want neighbours <NUM> or <NUM> houses down the road to hear you , consider pumping out that cash for a more expensive system
but for regular people like me on a budget , this system is an excellent solution for any sound need .
pros : low price , decent sound , unobtrusive , easy to set up
unlike some <NUM> or systems , the pc works bass unit is shielded , in case you ever need to put it close to your monitor
cons : though it seems a bit silly to complain that a $50 set of speakers offers less than perfect sound reproduction -- heck , i have spent far more than that on speaker wire -- the &quot ; subwoofer&quot ; in this set is not really a subwoofer at all
it is a woofer , and exhibits a rather uneven frequency response
still , the sound is fine for games and most internet music content
as long as you aren not expecting them to sound like a good pair of living room speakers -- don not believe the hype on the box -- you probably won not be disappointed .
i have been using it on my pc for <NUM> years now
this product proved to be very reliable
it sounds great with games and cd audio
it sounds a lot better than those mini <NUM> speakers
for just $40 , i don not see why we should use the cheapy mini speakers
my only complain is the volume distortion
if i push the volume higher than <NUM> using the volume control , the speakers starts to have some background noise .
excellent speaker system for the price
extraordinary sound , and great bass
fully recomended to anyone shopping for computer speakers .
let me preface this review : these speakers are not for the audiophile
if you want high end sound , completely distortion free at full volume , with a treble that can call in the dogs from a mile away and a bass that can rattle cracks in your house is foundation these are not the speakers for you
but if you don not want to spend a lot of money and you still want reasonable quality , these speakers are a good buy
given the price of these speakers , i must say i was amazed at the sheer clarity of the sound
i tested them with my car cd player and they played everything from classical beethoven to classic rock with alaming precision
they worked equally well on my computer for cds , mp3s , and dvds
the bass was separately adjustable--a plus at this price range--and the apparatus was easy to set up
i did not experience audible hiss that was noted by some of the reviewers , but at higher end of the volume setting the higher sounds tended to fray and the bass became a little muddy
no matter
this is not the speaker set up for a large room or a home theater
these are personal speakers that will function best in a small room or office and they pack more than enough punch for this venue
my five star rating reflects the quality of the product given its price
i have listened to other speakers by boston acoustics , altec lansing , and yamaha that were bought for almost double this price that did not sound as good as these
once again , this is not audiophile sound , but who can expect that in this price range ? i highly recommend them for the basic user who does not want to pay a premium for premium sound .
i bought these for the price and really did get more than what i paid for
if you are shooting for looks , you won not get it
these speakers are ugly and i hate the external volume control
makes for too many wires running around if your like me and have ethernet cables and a bazillion extension cords already
as far as sound goes i thought they were far more than serviceable
if you really like to turn it up i would recommend something a little more powerful , but if you have them in a smaller room and such they will do great
great price , nice sound , ugly packaging , but a definite recommendation overall .
not very loud , and the sub tends to get boomy
other than that , best sound for the money ( still is )
perfect &quot ; &quot ; for a student living in a dorm
took it to a friend is home with a portable cd player
my friend laughed at my portable gimmicky stereo at first
they weren not laughing anymore when they heard it playing .
these speakers are great , great sound from a cheap sound card , full sound and power .
the cambridge soundworks pcworks speaker system was designed by audio hall of fame member henry kloss and made in partnership with creative labs , the company that also manufactures soundblaster audio cards for pc is
simply put , this compact computer speaker system is an absolute dynamo ! it consists of two x x satellite cubes , a x x subwoofer unit , and a wired remote volume control unit
the subwoofer is the central unit in the system
in addition to pumping out a deep , mellifluous , natural sounding bass into the room , it provides amplification for the satellites
it doesn not take long at all to get the cambridge soundworks pcworks speaker system set up and running
here is all you have to do : * connect one of the volume controller is leads to the computer is &quot ; audio out&quot ; port , and the other lead to the subwoofer
* connect each satellite is lead to the subwoofer
* plug the subwoofer into household current
* as the instruction manual points out , the human ear can not distinguish the location of bass frequencies ; so subwoofer placement is not critical
i suggest placing it on or near the floor on a shelf
for best results , don not place anything within <NUM> inches directly in front of the subwoofer
after setting up my cambridge soundworks pcworks speakers , i really put them through their paces
i test drove them with music as diverse as beethoven is &quot ; spring&quot ; violin sonata and &quot ; the best of the guess who
&quot ; i played a variety of computer games
and , i watched the movie &quot ; gladiator&quot ; in my computer is dvd player
in all cases , the sound from these little cambridge soundworks pcworks gems was simply magnificent
at all times , crisp , clear , well balanced , and natural
never any distortion , fuzziness , or clipping , regardless of how loud i set the volume
i &quot ; discovered&quot ; cambridge soundworks speaker systems a couple years ago , when i bought an &quot ; ensemble iv&quot ; satellite/subwoofer system for my stereo
when i first bought it , i was amazed at the sound quality that emanated from that miniature dynamo ; two years later i am still amazed
the cambridge soundworks pcworks is as good as my &quot ; ensemble iv&quot ; system ; in fact , i rate it as the best computer speaker system i have ever heard
considering its very inexpensive price tag , it also a system that packs a huge &quot ; bang for the buck&quot ; for consumers
so , if you are looking for a new computer speaker system that will bring your games , music , and movies alive , look no farther that cambridge soundworks pcworks
go ahead
buy `em and set `em up
then kick back and enjoy the music !
i am no audiophile
increasingly , my music is stored in the form of <NUM> khz mp3 is so i can take it with me or put it in very large playlists on my computer
that implies some small amount of loss of sound quality
i am the kind of guy who is happy to live with that
that having been said , these speakers are ideal for the purpose
after comparing them at a store with several other more mainstream brands , i was impressed at the amount of what those audiophile glossies call 'presence' , especially at the low volumes appropriate for apartment dwelling
beat the altec and labtec speakers hollow - dunno why , particularly
a bose system was a little better - and about <NUM> times the price
the large isubwoofer' only gets frequencies that your brain is spatial localization system ( mediated by the lateral lemniscus -&gt ; superior olivary nucleus pathways , if there are any neuroscientists reading this ) isn not equipped to deal with
so set it under your desk , put the little <NUM> inch cubes on your desk ( or hang em from something with the included tape , each weighs about an oz
) and get ready for great sound at a great price ! i originally bought a set for my computer but went ahead and bought extra sets for every room in my home , including the bathroom , so i can have music now if i want
the price is right to do that !
very high level of noise three pixels on all the time
otherwise it is about as good as a low quality surveillance cam
i don not know what the other reviewers are used to but they need to look around
for the price it is ok in good light forget it when the light begins to fade
the software is somewhat deficient too
when i tried to do a video capture it froze up
i would not recommend this to anyone
this is an incredible camera , especially in regard to its capabilities
i used mine for years , but as windows os versions changed , the camera became less and less cooperative with the pc , and with windows <NUM> finally stopped working completely
( it didn not do that well with xp , either )
so , if you are running an os older than xp , you can not go wrong with this camera ; especially at this price !
these webcams are excellent and it is a shame that they no longer make these web cams anymore
you will be able to buy them from auction sites ( e
, ebay ) or here at amazon
but most likely , you will have to search endlessly for the drivers of the item ! when you find the drivers that you need to run this item
you will find an excellent , high quality webcam and worth the price ! i use webcams for a living ( conference calls
) and own video conferencing cameras
and for the price of these cameras
they are worth it !
as expected with any ccd , mine got a hospot burned into the image where the sun hit the camera at the same point every afternoon ( i have it watching my front pasture )
i have since adjusted the position
also : a lot of the software included is actually demo versions and if you want to use them for more than just play you either have to go buy the full version or hack around your setup to work aroung the limits of the demo version ( this seems to be a common , but still misleading , way all the cam manufactures bundle the software with their webcams .
pros : it is actually a relabled vicam , which has been favorably reviewed in the past
excellent low light performance
detachable usb cable is easily replaced with a longer one
comes with an unregistered copy of webcam32 which is an excellent program for putting your camera on the web
cons : apparently 3com now owns the product , so expect no driver updates and no useful customer support .
if you need a camera that takes higher quality , and higher resolution photos in all kinds of light , you will need this camera
the 3com homeconnect has remarkable capability
i use it as a &quot ; weather cam
&quot ; it is pointed out the window of my office in edinburgh , indiana where it adapts well to everything from bright sunlight to ambient street lighting at night
unlike most webcams , this one features a resolution as high as 640x480
i also like the long , detachable usb cord
another plus is the easy setup utility
basically , all you do is put the cd in the drive and it tells you onscreen what to do next
it is so simple ! just don not plug the camera into the usb port before the program instructs you to do so
it is not the least expensive camera on the market , but the extra price gets you a much better camera than the average webcam .
although it says that the camera is not windows certified when it is being stalled , i have no problem whatsoever
i got the latest driver from vividcommunications
i have no idea why some people report problem or color problems but this camera is the best that i have used in term of clarity and capability
i think once you figure out how to set this camera up , you'd enjoy this camera
with interchangable lenses , the camera can cover a wide range of angles
as for mounting , i went to best buy and got a pair of speaker wall mounts for about $$ , which provides all the adjustment angles you'd need
you only need one mount for each camera but have to buy them in pairs , as they are made for speakers
good luck to those who are getting a webcam
if you need more info on the mount , just contact me .
i think peoples' expectations of web cams are so low that they rate things at <NUM> or <NUM> stars too easily
this camera is lousy , and isn not worth $90
the details : installation : good
installed on a win2k pro sp4
no problem at all
color : terrible
no matter how you set the controls , use auto or manual , or mess with the settings , the green/red/blue color rendition is always awful
color shades are all wrong - either too vivid , too washed out , too green , to intense , etc
frame rate : terrible
there are <NUM> settings for picture quality vs frame rate
on &quot ; high&quot ; quality , you get a nice smooth picture with color , and a frame rate of <NUM> fps ( i measured it )
on medium , the picture is very grainy , so you can turn down the sharpness , which helps &quot ; somewhat&quot ; - frame rate is now <NUM> fps
on &quot ; low&quot ; , the picture is downright awful , with grain , and jagged lines , and the frame rate is still only about <NUM> fps
it cannot do <NUM> fps , nowhere near it , not at 160x120 , 176x144 , 320x240
forget it
cpu : good
uses about the same as other good webcams i have tried --- about <PERCENT> of a piii <NUM> mhz to capture 320x240 at <NUM> fps
light sensitivity : good
the picture quality does not degrade , and the frame rate doesn not drop in low light , and the picture is plenty bright enough
unfortunately , the picture is never good , and the frame rate is never good , so this is of little value
go try a logitech quickcam pro <NUM> or an intel cs430 and you will see what a good web cam is capable of .
far better resolution and optical quality than more recent webcams , these 3com computer video cameras are still useful many years after being discontinued
at the time , they were available with interchangeable focal length lenses as well
worth seeking out .
i was nervous buying this camera as i had read horror stories of how people couldn not get to install this on their computers
but i was hooked to this camera is response to low light and went ahead and bought it
i made sure i stuck to the installation sequence ( software tests first , installs drivers and then you hook up the camera on reboot ) and it worked ! not only that this is a twain compatible device and i got it to work smoothly with adobe photoshop 5
0 and premier 5
this deal is worth the risk
picture and video quality is really good and even better than the ones that come out of the sgi video cameras ( supposedly the graphics powerhorses ) .
i bought this camera after reading several reviews here , on cnet , and also by visiting webcam sites that use this particular camera
i heeded the advice of reviewers to go directly to 3com is site to download the latest drivers for this , and installed those first instead of using the
no problems on a micron , 450mhz , <NUM> ram , win <NUM> machine
i installed the software no prob , but be forewarned the webcam32 software ( to create your own webcam on the internet ) included is *not* registered ! you will have to pay for it if you plan to use it for more than an hour
i did pay , just because i wanted this specifically for a webcam
i am not that crazy about the webcam32 software though - it feels quite amateurish
alas , it is the only thing i have , so i will stick with it
apparently many other webcam creators like it
the low light performance of this camera is excellent
it self adjusts to many light situations
even the largest image resolution is very clear
i previously had a logitech quickcam web usb camera , but the image was quite grainy on that , and it was hard to get anything clear in a dark situation
but it is user friendliness was excellent
and it had a convenient free membership to spotlife
com , that hooked it is software into logitech is , which did all the work for you to send a webcam image to their site
( with a quick refresh time as well )
i only wish this 3com camera had something as useful and easy
also no problems with angling of the camera in the direction you want , as i read in another review
perhaps i got an improved version ? the cable doesn not weigh it down at all , and it sticks in the position you put it
3com has discontinued this camera , so get it while you can for good quality ! this camera is quite small unlike the photos
if you are just starting out , you might want to consider another cam for ease of use .
very unhappy with this
setup was a breeze contrary to much i have read but the picture quality is horrible because this camera is very used and very beat up
upon first connect the images were a total washed out blur
i removed to lens to clean it all and it looked like milk or oil had been spilled all over this camera in the past
after much cleaning the images are now almost recognizable
still very poor , i can not believe someone would sell a product , new or used , in this poor condition
zero stars if i could
my $19 labtec cam takes far better pictures
the 3com homeconnect might be good , i don not know because the one i got is in such bad shape .
&<HASHTAG> ; great camera
but it is made for widows 95 , windows 98 , and windows 2000
the furnished drivers are for those systems only , and will not work with later operating systems
also , i cannot locate any vista or win7 drivers for the camera
too bad ! the mac does not even recognize that the camera is connected .
palm comes with a stylus
if you lose it then buy this , otherwise it is a waste
and by the way , if you have long fingernails you can use that to input into your palm when you are too lazy to take the stylus out
i bought these babies the same day that i bought my vx
i thought that it would have been a good investment counsidering how small the styli are
considering my penchant for misplacing things , particularly pens , i thought i should go ahead and get them
for some strange reason , i have only lost one in <NUM> months and that was the one that came with the unit
in that aspect one pack of these replacement stylus should last you a while
however if you can get other replacement styli that can fit the silo i suggest you go that way
the replacement styli dont seem to fit the silo as well as the original one
it doesnt fit right
after a little investigation i found that the plastic tip ( the part that can unscrew ) is slightly larger in circumference then the original stylus
thats why it seems a little tight when you take the it out and put it back
why this is , i have no clue but it is really annoying
for anything else you can get these babies to preserve the continuity of the unit , otherwise i recommend you find another replacement stylus that can fit the silo
personally though i dont use the stylus
i recommend you go get one of those that have a stylus , pen and pencil all in one
all serious palm users use one of these instruments simply because any type of prolong use of the stock stylus will certainly give you cramps , at the very least
its like writing with a toothpick
if you anticipate that your going to be scribling on your palm a lot go get a multipen
cross makes a good one , lamy and rotring also makes excellent multipens
personally i use a rotring black matte
it carries a blue pen , stylus and pencil
its a great size , weight and looks incredibly cool
again if you anticipate scribling alot on your palm , i strongly recommend getting a
however if you dont think you will be the stock stylus will suffice .
 stylus , <NUM> of them even ! they even seem better than the one that was actually included with my palm pilot
a stylus is an easy thing to misplace , lose , just like a pen , so its great to have a few in your briefcase or purse !
the stylus fits perfectly in my antiquated palm pilot and i really like the weight of the stylus
my pda might be old but it works for me
thank you very much !
your palm v probably came with two -- one metal with plastic ends and a hidden pin to reset your palm , and one all plastic
these are exact replacements for the metal stylus that came with your palm
that is about it ! for the price it seemed like a good idea to have them around just in case
you can also keep a spare in each car , or whatever .
this stylus is tip seems to be of a harder plastic than that of the palm iii is ( the one with a silver metal body and grey plastic ends )
having just switched from iii to v , the difference was dramatic
i have spares of the iii type at my desk -- it is quicker to just grab that than pull the palm is one out , and i won not forget to put it back
i am afraid of wearing down my palm is sensor surface , so am shopping for a &quot ; softer&quot ; stylus for the v
( the v is are a touch slimmer , so my spare stylii won not fit its holder
the styli are of sufficient quality for me to be satisfied with them ( = they work ) , but i have two complaints about this product : - the product is said to be &quot ; same as stylus provided with product&quot ; and a &quot ; genuine palm quality product&quot ;
it is neither
these styli do not fit the silo perfectly and the screws at the top and bottom are badly made , in contrast to the perfect screws and silo fitting of those that were provided with the product
- the price is excessive
why should a simple piece of mass produced plastic cost over three u
$s , especially considering the mediocre quality of the product ?
if you want to convert your vhs video tapes into digital format and don not want to purchase an expensive video capture card , this is an alternative
i have been able to convert vhs tapes into decent mpg , real , and microsoft windows media files in size <NUM> x 240 , but not without some hassle
as an earlier reviewer pointed out , the software that comes with this product is very buggy and be prepared to spend some time troubleshooting to get it working
here is my first experience
i use windows <NUM> on a piii 550mhz , with <NUM> ram and <NUM> gig eide harddrive
when dazzle arrived , i followed the directions and installed the software and put the plug in the usb port and then discovered that this software only works with windows 98
i visited the dazzle web site and found out that you have to purchase a program called movie star is you want to use it with windows 2000
i wound up ordering the software for [more $] plus shipping
once , i received the new disk , i installed it , and once again , it did not detect the unit when i plugged it into the usb port
and again , i visited the dazzle web site
i discovered that they have posted a patch for the movie star software that fixes &quot ; some minor problems
&quot ; i downloaded and installed the patch and after rebooting the machine , i was able to get it to detect the unit
the next step was to get dazzle to work with my cheap
mitsubishi vhs player
i was able to get it to work with the port from my panasonic dv camcorder , but i couldn not get it to detect the output plugs from the vhs player
finally after rebooting the machine twice , i got it to work
next getting the software to work was another challange
despite having a fast machine with a lot of ram , i found the movie star program to be very unstable
i was able to capture up to <NUM> minutes of video and save it to the mpeg format , but everytime i tried to edit or export the video as windows media or real , it crashed the machine
i downloaded a copy of ulead is video studio , but couldn not figure out how to import mpeg files
i finally bit the bullet and wound up downloading a free trial of adobe premier
i found premier to be a very stable and easy to use program
i just wish it didn not cost [so much ! ]for my trouble , i found the output from dazzle to be satisfactory
you would get better results if you spent big money for video capture card that would let you plug an cable into the back of your pc
another better alternative would be to use firewire
( i always use firewire with my panasonic dv camcorder and it works great
) after my experience , i cannot recommend this unit to others
i don not think it is fair that this company charges windows <NUM> users extra $
for buggy software
and i think they could improve the usb connect so it isn not so difficult to use
i am giving this unit two stars because it does the job , but only after spending a lot of time and some additional money to make it work .
the usb version of the dazzle dm4100 video capture box is an excellent way to capture video into the mpeg1 format in real time
this format plays back well on modern pc and mac computers but doesn not take up too much hard drive space
the quality isn not as good as a professional encoder but then it costs about a tenth of the price .
first time i plugged it in and installed the drivers it worked instantly
captured about four hours worth of high quality video with no sync problems on a with 128megs ram
i then installed a usb cd writer
the dazzle device no longer works
i really don not care what installing the cd writer did , i see this as a major flaw
my usb cd writer and usb zip drive work perfectly
i am now forced to use this device on another , much slower computer
nothing about this is mentioned on their site
this product is very flakey
after making changes to video settings , you must exit the program , unplug the device , plug it back in , and restart the capture program
this seems to be dazzle is solution for every problem i have encountered with this piece of uhm
it feels as if this product was rushed out in a &quot ; just make it work&quot ; strategy
dazzle obviously did not test this product thoroughly enough before finalizing it
stay away
get a digital camcorder and dv card instead .
if you want a small , low resolution image that has unsynchronized audio ( or you have forever to wait on the audio sync ) , this one is for you ! oh , yea , don not expect to be able to videoconference with your camcorder
if you want to capture home videos with no or low loss of quality and want it done at a reasonable speed , you probably don not want this one ( or any other usb or similarly slow external connection ) .
the dazzle multimedia dm4100 digital video creator is very useful to import video from your tv , vcr or dvd player into your pc for editing and then converting to pc video formats
the device is exceptionally good for making videos for use on the web or as attachments
thanks to its use of usb its very simple to install and can be &quot ; &quot ; with other usb device without rebooting your computer
i don not recommend using the device if you plan on editing videos on your computer and want to export it to video tape
if you will be using the device primarily for making videos for web broadcasting there is an internet version available that is optimized for this task
the internet version also includes a realvideo converter and encoder
the included software package is very useful and stable
however , the included ulead video studio and ulead photo express are not the most current version .
obviously there must have been an issue with a lot of the players that were made with this model # , but i haven not seen it
i have had the player for <NUM> years + and never had one issue with it
its the first and only stand alone dvd player i have had and works wonderfully
i also own <NUM> sony tvs , a sony reciever and vcr and satellite system and haven not once had an issue
i think that sony has continued their product quality no matter where they are built .
dvd is work just fine in this player
but i purchased it with the intention of viewing home movie vcd is
not happenin'
no matter what i try ( vcd , svcd , different disks ,
) this model will not play them
i have seen dvd players costing under $100 play the very same vcd is without any problems .
i bought this dvd from amazon in november , have watched wellover <NUM> dvd is ( see why later ) and played a lot of cds
. the cd sounds even better than my other cd deck
what i like most is the headphone jack that allows me to listen to cd and watch dvd just with the dvd machine powered on , without disturbing others
now the best part
that even amazon staff does not know
this machine qualifies for <NUM> free dvds and <NUM> free rental ( 10 from netflix , <NUM> from blockbuster via sony coupon and <NUM> from blockbuster 10/20 program )
i waited until now to write this comment because i want to verify the above
i got all that
what can i say : outstanding picture , gorgeous sound ( i had a full <NUM> speakers sound system mated to a 5x100 watts dolby digital , dts receiver ) , and all the freebies listed above
you must be nut for buying any other dvd brand
after all , this is a sony !
mine is a just over a year old
guess what ? yep , it is croaking
in fact , every sony product i bought the past decade -- a phone , <NUM> portable cd players , a tv , and now this -- failed just after the warranty expired
i have finally learned my lesson .
this is a great machine all around
what puts this ahead of other units is that you can pull up the dvd menu not only from the remote but also on the front of the unit
it even has a dial on the unit for still , pause and frame advance which is very smooth
this unit even has a 5
1 dolby digital decoder for 5
1 upgradable receivers
you get a choice of composite , s or component video outputs
the remote works on all sony tvs
very , very good for the money .
i bought a sony <NUM> in 08/1999 , and have had no problems at all
the only problem i have noticed is that a disc is supposed to resume from the point you stopped when you push &quot ; stop&quot ; and the display says &quot ; resume
&quot ; mine does not do this consistently , and never seems to do it with cd , but perhaps this feature does not work with cd
aside from that one baffling inconsistency , i love my 530
i have it hooked into a yamaha dolby digital &quot ; ready&quot ; receiver , and find that the bass management controls in the sony <NUM> are excellent for setting up my system
i have a full surround system using all paradigm monitor series speakers , and the sound from the <NUM> when used as a cd player is so clear that you can hear individual string plucks on guitar , and other details you don not often hear
the picture quality is so superior to vhs , that i can scarcely stand to watch vhs anymore
when it comes to video products , and particularly digital video , you can not beat sony
don not waste your money trying any other brands
you will just wish you had bought sony to begin with .
i have owned this player for approximately <NUM> years and have learned all ( or at least most ) of its foibles
there are several major problems you should be aware of with this unit : ( 1 ) lip synch problems
the audio and video streams will unpredictably go out of synch from time to time , requiring you to stop the dics and restart to get the streams back in synch
( 2 ) noticeable video artifacting ( jaggies , combing , moire , etc
) on ordinary dvd discs that have scenes with "difficult" mpeg encoding
( 3 ) poor handling of many discs with extremely subtle scratches
one disc we rented ( talented mr
ripley ) was so bad that the sony s530d would not play an entire chapter of the movie
however , the el cheapo dvd player in my dinosaur laptop computer playerd it without incident
( 4 ) most of the time , the player spontaneously turns itself "off" about ten seconds after you turn it "on"
when i turn it "on" a second time it stays "on" properly
it doesn not matter if there is a dvd in the tray or not , or if you turn it "on" from the front panel or with the remote ( 5 ) slow transition from one dvd layer to the next
in short , buying this machine was a bad idea when it was first introduced
today , there must be literally scores of better models out there
buy one of them instead .
the dvd player is great
perfect player , with a good mix of features vs
did notice a problem with one dvd , but it has not occurred in the past month or two , but i shall keep watching for it
if you get this dvd player , you will not be disappointed .
the &quot ; &quot ; problem has shown up on my 550d model once while watching over <NUM> movies
other than this issue , the dvd player rates <NUM> stars !
i have to assume that the problem referred to inearlier reviews must have been taken care of , because i haven notencountered the slightest problem
the video quality is simply astonishing - i won my wife over by doing a direct comparison with the laserdisc and dvd versions of &quot ; gone with the wind&quot ; - she is <PERCENT> sold now ! there is enough flexibility that you can upgrade to a tv if you don not have one now ; i am using the output and that blows me away
the remote has excellent human factors engineering - i have no trouble using it in a room for the usual functions ( pause , slow forward/backwards , fast , etc
) plus some handy features like &quot ; how much time is left on the movie ? &quot ; menu access is simple and intuitive , too - no buttons to feel around for
full 5
1 outputs and dts/dolby digital if you can use them and a host of options for the speaker folks
really , this has everything you could ask for in a player in this price range - i don not know who selected the toshiba as amazon is pick , but this is really the one you want !
i bought this dvd player and have had no problems whatsoever
the picture quality has been flawless , as has the sound
i have not had any or fuzzy lines , etc
i have played both austin powers movies , rounders , contact , pulp fiction , and two gratefuld dead dvd is , along with an assortment of audio cd is
it did take me a little while how to figure out how to get the audio set up properly for 5
1 , as the default setup when you buy it is for just two front speakers .
after reading every review we could find , we ventured for the first time into the digital photographic world purchasing the olympus digital camera
we were definitely not disappointed
after just a few days the camera accompanied us to ulaanbaatar , mongolia and seoul , s
korea , while we nervously left our canon slr at home
the camera performed marvelously
we found the optional 16mb flash memory card more than adequate for our needs , as we easily downloaded photos each day into our laptop
we were amazed at the quality of photos even in low light settings
we took shots at our conference including a multimedia presentation where surprisingly the projected image on the screen was readable ! while staying in the countryside in a traditional mongolian &quot ; ger&quot ; ( tent ) , we shot an incredible photo of the predawn sky-- even the morning stars are clearly distinguishable ! arriving home we were completely satisfied with the photos shot at the low resolution setting when printed out on our hp deskjet <NUM> using an epson photographic paper
i doubt that most people would be able to tell the difference between the prints and a standard developed snapshot
the enclosed olympus and adobe software is easy to use and functional for most home use
you will absolutely love the quickstitch utility that simply creates oversized and panorama shots ! one of the only weaknesses we found a little frustrating was the variance between the optical viewfinder and the digital one
if you frame
say , a head and shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder , you will discover that digitally the camera sees a much broader area
olympus should do a little better job calibrating the two viewfinders
apart from that , you will want to invest in the nimh charger and at least <NUM> batteries-- shop around for the best price
also , picking up a 3
5 inch floppy adapter for the flash memory card will be a big time saver
you simply pull out the flash memory card , slip it into the adapter , and then slide the floppy into any computer
you will save time and frustration over having cords laying all around your table , plus a significant download time
one last item-- do you think a 16mb memory card will be too small for your needs ? olympus , through their website , is offering an inexpensive upgrade through the end of december that will allow the camera to use the new 32mb memory cards .
the olympus is , in my opinion , the best value digital camera available right now
the picture quality is impressive---i usually can not tell the difference between the pictures it takes and pictures taken with a $340 slr that i have scanned in
also , the camera is fairly lightweight and compact and easy to use , like a good point and shoot camera should be
since i bought my olympus , i have not taken <NUM> photograph
i enjoy the simplicity of the camera and the freedom from developing and film costs ( some $10/roll )
overall , the camera is worth the investment and it is an excellent camera for someone new to digital photography .
i have owned an olympus <NUM> for two years and i have been very happy with it
but i recently upgrade to the olympus <NUM> because the <NUM> just couldn not give me the i was looking for ! frame a photo from the <NUM> and you can tell it is a digital photo
frame a photo from the <NUM> and you would never know it was digital ! so , i love this camera and it was a great camera for me to learn about digital photography and to see if i liked a digital camera more than my old 35mm
but , two years later , i have found the need to upgrade
however , due to the significant price jump , the comparisons to the <NUM> are not totally fair ! so i still give the <NUM> a rating of <NUM> stars because for the price i think it is a great option !
i posted a review of this camera a few weeks ago , shortly after purchasing it
i gave it <NUM> stars , mainly because the manual wasn not well written
however , that still being the case , i must say that this camera deserves <NUM> stars ! it takes amazingly clear , bright pictures
the video display lcd is bright
and it seemed to take forever for the rechargable batteries to run down ! i highly recommend this camera ! if it had an optical zoom , it would be perfect
however , with this camera , you get more than you pay for !
so many people have written about the technical part of this wonderful camera
i agree with many of them
you won not feel bad about spending your $$$
i have shopped around and i have made my decison with confidence
( yes , you can find this item for less at other , but i trust amazon , they deliver promptly and their customer service is great ! ) some customers have said that this camera eats batteries like crazy
it is only true when you use the lcd monitor to take pictures
if you use it for reviewing ( and deleting ) the pictures you have taken , it lasts a long , long time
i have purchased my camera before thanksgiving
it is december 12 , and after taking hundreds of pictures ( most using flash ) , i am still using the batteries it came with ! lemme tell ya a little secret , if you do take pictures using the lcd monitor , and you get the message that the battery is low , turn off the camera , let it rest for a little while and turn it back on again
the battery life will show full again ! no need to change the batteries until it tells you it is dead and you have been taking pictures using the viewfinder
now , it is not a bad idea to get yourself some rechargeable nimh batteries
i have seen many good comments about the brand maha
also , i have seen great reviews on maha is charger model
some people have mentioned them here
but i didn not know where to purchase them from
so here you go
for more info on the maha products , go to website
and to purchase these two products , check out is website ( sorry i can not include the exact web addresses according to the reviews guidelines , but it isn not hard to figure out )
for around $50 i got the charger and <NUM> nimh batteries
now you can go on the road and not worry about your batteries dying or where to purchase them
it is a lot of fun to have a digital camera and take hundreds and hundreds of pictures knowing you don not have to pay for developement or wait to finally see your pictures
just download them and enjoy or use the video cable to see your photos on your tv
or just use the lcd monitor ! : ) -- from a happy olympus/amazon customer
: )
i have owned the camera for one week and it has worked very good so far
i agree with the other customers about the manual
it would be a lot better if it had a section for each language , not three languages together in one page
but the camera is very easy to use , takes excellent pictures and has many nice features
with a tripod , you can take great pictures at night without the flash ! the software is also very easy to use
although it is not documented in the manual , the camera comes with a twain driver , so you can choose to download the photos with the bundled application or with your favorite photo editing software .
la olympus ha sido mi &uacute ; nica c&aacute ; mara digital , la he tenido por m&aacute ; s de <NUM> a&ntilde ; os y no tengo queja alguna excepto por dos cosas : 1
si se utiliza la pantalla lcd para tomar fotograf&iacute ; as panor&aacute ; micas o con el zoom incorporado , las bater&iacute ; as no van a durar casi nada
el transferir las im&aacute ; genes a la pc puede tardar una eternidad &uacute ; nicamente para ver el contenido de la tarjeta de memoria , luego viene el proceso de bajarlas al disco duro
consejo : hay que comprar el adaptador ac de lo contrario las bater&iacute ; as se consumir&aacute ; n velozmente ! respecto a la calidad de las fotos , no me puedo quejar de nada
excelente calidad y si quieren tener m&aacute ; s espacio para almacenar
compren la tarjeta smartmedia de 16mb mientras duren existencias !
this may have only 1
2 mp but it is the best camera ever made in the digital arena ! really
( as evidenced by the unusually hi cost in the used camera market for these 1
3mp cameras ) i own <NUM> of them and use them for my business
people are always commenting on what great quality photos i produce
the adjustment allows you to take photos in low pixels so the saved photos won not eat up all the space on your computer or camera card
*a note of caution , the smart cards with mpixels that fit this camera are very difficult to find now days and expensive to boot
i think it won not take over a 16mp card .
this is a great little camera
a real bargain at this price
excellent color and quality pictures
only drawback is slow serial interface to computer
buy a flashpath floppy adapter or a memory card reader to transfer pictures faster
a good card reader that won not crash your system is made by siig
they call it their usb reader
about $79 street price
also get the maha charger and nimh batteries reviewed elsewhere on this page .
this dvd player is great for home or travel
only two little quirks : the bottom gets really hot , and you can not plug it in to a car outlet
otherwise it is really cool !
if you like dvd watching on planes or in airports , this player is excellent
it does get a little hot , but not too bad
the amount you pay for this unit has come down now due to a new model out in a few months with a <NUM> inch screen .
i love this player ! i travel frequently and the l50 keeps me company in the airport lounge and on the airplane
the folks that make the powerxtender laptop adapters for airplanes are going to be shipping one for the l50 so you won not need to take extra batteries on those long flights
the screen is very nice looking , and the 16x9 format lets you view anamorphic format dvds in their best possible resolution
of course , the wide screen also causes you to curse the dvds that aren not anamorphic ( e
, titanic )
the sound from the speakers is ok , but sounds very good from a pair of headphones
for travelers i recommend a pair of the sony noise cancelling ear buds .
hey , this is by far the biggest step up in portable that will ever happen
great picture and sound quality comes from the <NUM> speakers
the only thing that you might want to think about here is the battery life ! this was a major frustration in trying to watch any movie more than <NUM> hours long since the battery life is approximately two hours
this was pretty good however , and the battery life doesn not hurt the rating for me since i got the power adapter !
otherwise very good - never tested limits of the battery - have used on ac generally - works very well , pricey - i would wait for one more generation if too expensive
we use this when travelling on airlines
but to make it work the very best , you need a couple of additional items
you need good noise cancelling ear phones to get rid of the background noise on airplanes , trains , buses , cars , etc
panasonic model or similar
you need a isplitter' so that two of you ( if you have a significant other ) can watch the movie together
( radio shack ) then all you need to bring is popcorn
for those long flights , you will need one or two extra batteries
the battery that comes with it will play for about three hours
it takes a long time to charge these batteries ( about four hours ) so be prepared
enjoy !
i absolutely love this product
the picture and sound are both great
the unit comes with enough cables to get you hooked into a tv
it even has on optical out , so you buffs will enjoy pure digital
i travel quite a bit and this thing has been great for occupying my time
as far as not using it on an airplane- i disagree
i beleive the line goes- &quot ; portable electronic devices may now be used with the expection of cellular phones and pagers
&quot ; most all laptops have and they have not been the cause of any plane crashes to date
in summary- if you travel a lot get it , but shop around for the best deal .
i get only 2 : 15 of battery life on average , barely enough to watch a good movie
i'd love to see cheaper packs , or a camera battery add on option
it plays +r but not +rw disks .
i read the reviews by other people here and am wondering loudly whether they know what these batteries are for ? they are rechargeable batteries for devices that require higher mah rating
nimh batteries or nicd batteries do not hold charge like an alkaline battery so if you have charged an nimh battery and put it in say an alarm clock , the batteries will lose charge in less than a month
they are for immediate usages like digital cameras where you need high mah batteries and that digital cameras drain batteries
its more like "spend it immediately" battery unlike the disposable batteries that discharge in a circuit but drain very slowly when not in a circuit
i use energizer aa batteries for my digicam and they recharge the flash much faster than even the best disposable batteries
a best guide is to look whether the appliance for which you are buying this battery is listed on the package or is identical to those on the package
this 9v would be a great thing for a toy where the battery drains out fast and you cannot afford disposable ones everyday
just a note : if the device is a direct draining one like a motor and not in a circuit , do not use a rechargeable battery since if they are completely drained , they cannot be recharged .
this is a very good product ! it still take a charge ! very good echarable battery
my husband uses it for his recording mixer ! good to have for outdoors use .
i charged this battery up and tried it in my garage door opener remote - it used to open from about <NUM> feet away , but now it barely works at <NUM> feet
i'd recommend that you stay away from this 9v
i have been quite happy with the other nimh sizes from energizer .
they don not hold a charge
i have found it is a lot cheaper to buy regular duracell batteries at costco and just keep replacing !
we use this in our alarm clock for when the power goes out as it often does
so far this little rechargable hasn not needed a recharge & is doing a fine job making sure when get up on time when the power goes out & then back on while were sleeping
i gave it <NUM> stars because we haven not had it long enough to get a really good opinion on it aside from the one just given .
so far soo good
it works and run like a power battery ! if you like power this is a must buy
this battery , like other rechargable batteries i own , is rated for 8
4 volts and i am told is likely even less
why not go with maha ? it is rated at over <NUM> volts , which for my applications ( powering a headroom micro dac ) makes all the difference
i can only imagine that a battery with a rating which conforms to a devices' designated power requirements , is better across the board .
i bought two of these batteries with the overnight nimh family battery charger , and so far the batteries have performed as expected
haven not used it enough to see if they take memory if charged to frequently but so far so good
great product ! so now i have used this product for <NUM> months on a microphone to line amplifyer and they last about <NUM> days on average
the batteries take <NUM> to <NUM> hours for a full charge which is pretty ridiculous ! luckly i only use one at a time so i have time to charge the other one
i would still say great product !
i ordered the product for the purpose of having to use them in our wireless handset mic system for the church , they work great ! we were going through about <NUM> 9v batteries every week , but with this it holds enough charge for the wireless system for <NUM> 1 hour services each battery ! it has taken the cost of batteries from $15 a week to nothing and it can be charged overnight ! no problems at al with them , in fact we ordered <NUM> of them for backups along with <NUM> aa rechargables that we use for our cd players and recordering devices and they al work wonders !
i like energizer rechargeable batteries
i have used several before
this one is on a sprinkler timer and so far , so good .
i teach <NUM> classes a week , which require a battery for the mic
i got tired of buying these every week or two , so i bought the rechargable
the single charge lasts the entire week
i recharge it on the weekends and i am ready to go
no problems so far
i have had it for <NUM> months or so .
i am a strong supporter of rechargeable batteries , but at 7
2 volts , this just doesn not meet my needs
devices that use batteries are designed to work across a range of voltages because as the battery is used , the voltage slowly drops until the battery just runs out of juice
when the dying battery crosses a certain voltage threshold , some devices warn you of a low battery
this is a good thing , because you don not want , say , your smoke alarm to need to go onto backup battery power and not have the juice it needs
the problem here is that the devices i use seem to cross the low battery voltage threshold somewhere around 7
0 volts
that is to say , i put a fully charged battery in there and before i know it ( about <NUM> week or 2 ) , the low battery light comes on in my answering machine or the smoke alarm starts doing it is low battery beeping thing
nope , this is no good
i suggest you steer clear of energizer and go for another brand that has an 8
4 nominal voltage ( or better yet 9
6 if that extra
6v isn not going to harm your device--nimh cells go in increments of 1
2 v so as far as i know there is no way to get a 9
0 v battery )
sure this will work in many devices , but i really don not see why energizer opted to go for a 7
2v battery instead of 8
4v other than to save a small amount of money
that seems like a very sort of thing to do
<NUM> star only from me .
the energizer battery charger seems to be a great buy for the money
i have been using it for many years without any problems
the nimh batteries seem to last long and a good charger does help
i bought <NUM> extra chargers so i could charge <NUM> at one time
another great feature is that this battery charger could charge all types of batteries
you don not need different chargers for different batteries
i have shopped around ther internet and when amazon has it in stock in their store , buy it ! they have the best price ! i would buy <NUM> and get the free super saving shipping at the same time
happy charging ! peace , anthony
works good , much sturdier than the cheapo other brands
definitley a keeper !
i have used this charger for a while and it works really well
it charges both nimh and nicd batteries in all sizes aa , aaa , c , d& <NUM> volt
a full charge takes about six hours
you can charge different sizes at the same time
i consider this charger a very good investment and recommend it to all .
the only reason that i use this charger is in case i have a battery that is too dead to charge with my wonderful maha charger
unfortunately the maha needs some slight residual charge remaining for the processor to initiate a charge , so that is why i sometimes need to use this energizer chm4fc for around a half a minute to give the battery just enough juice for the maha to initiate a charge
the energizer chm4fc does not care how dead a battery is , but it does a poor job of charging compared to the my maha which uses pulsed charging
the maha can even erase the memory effect of old batteries
at least the energizer chm4fc does not burn up the batteries like those terrible life shortening <NUM> minute chargers however .
this is a versatile charger that charges all standard size nimh and nicads , and reliably
i have used it for a year with no problems , a good value for the price
smarter chargers have been recommended here ( at about three times the price ) to compensate for some of the issues with but less expensive chargers like this one
i must admit , the information provided by energizer with this charger doesn not help to understand the limitation of this 'fixed time' charger
it will put 430milliamps for <NUM> hours into a aa nimh
430ma times <NUM> hours = 2100mah
it uses 370ma in its 'nicad' setting for <NUM> hours = 1100mah for aas
since there is always some existing charge left in rechargeables before recharging , if your nimh aa is capacity is less than 2500mah ( typically yes for aa nimh ) they will be fully charged by this charger
likewise , nicad aas less than about 1200mah ( typical for nicads ) your batteries will be fully charged
you can use the information above and the charging currents given on the spec sheet for this charger to figure charging capacities for other size and capacity batteries
c and d size capacities greater than 30000mah will not be fully charged in one <NUM> hour cycle and will have to be cycled twice ( 2 x 3000mah = 6000mah ) or more times , unless left in the charger to trickle charge for a long period of time ( a good idea in any case to top off all charges )
every <NUM> hours of 65ma trickle current will add another 325mah charge to a c or d cell till it reaches its full rated mah capacity
trickle charging batteries by leaving them in the charger after the notimed' charge cycle ( 5 hours on 'nimh' setting , <NUM> hours on 'nicad' ) will keep your batteries topped off to full capacity at all times without hurting them
so , this charger is a good value if you understand what it does and and does not do
those with less knowledge or time , but more money , may want to buy the more expensive smart chargers others have mentioned here
the vanson would be my choice , a very good value
i have derated this charger because of lack of information provided to the consumer by energizer on its site and on its spec sheet for this charger
they are not alone in this department , but there is still no excuse for this
if you really don not need a universal ( all battery types charged ) then you can get a smart aa/aaa combination charger for much less
i would recommend the ripvan lighting 4000n at ripvan100
it charges fast but gently ( doesn not batteries , a life killer )
hope this has helped everyone
rechargeables are the only way to go for saving you gobs of money and the environment gobs of abuse
buy good high capacity rechargeables , like highly rated energizer is , and buy a good charger that will treat them right for you
noooooo overheating by cheap quick chargers .
my neighbor and i bought this charger but i returned mine and i think she is going to return hers also
it seems a little dated because it charges the batteries for a fixed amount of time ( both nimh and nicad )
so if your battery is only slightly discharged it will still charge it for the same time as if it were totally dead
it also can not charge batteries individually which my rayovac charger can
the only downfall of my rayovac is that it can only charge aa and aaa which is all i need
i paid <NUM> dollars for the energizer and the rayovac was only <NUM> dollars
big difference
if you can find a rayovac recharger at your local store get it ! i even got <NUM> nimh batteries for <NUM> dollars - plus they are all 1600mah ( higher the rating the more power )
just thought i'd let everyone know
it appears that there are several battery rechargers available that may be better for specific needs
for example , one may want a faster recharger for use with a camera , or one that does aa batteries only , or one that work with batteries only
for more specialized uses , there are instruments that are both higher and lower in price
that said , i agree that this is a versatile , reasonably priced recharger
as you can see above , it works on size aa , aaa , c , d , and 9v batteries
i have used the recharger safely now for over a year ( please read all safety instructions ) , usually by plugging it in at night
as noted elsewhere , you need to charge one or two pairs of batteries at a time ( with the exception of 9v batteries )
here are a few specs for people with some electrical knowledge ( unlike myself ; i just read these off the back ) : input : ac120v , 60hz , 15woutput : 2x ( 2
500ma ) 2x ( 9
13ma ) note : as stated clearly on front and back , use only for rechargeable hydride or batteries ( not both at the same time , however )
also , these batteries are generally more expensive than alkaline batteries , but for people who have a lot of toys and tools with different battery needs , this may be the one to get .
batteries are expensive no matter what you buy
this recharger is inexpensive and dependable
given that there are four battery docks , you will never run out of charged batters
this recharger quickly charges nickel metal hydrido ( nimh ) , ( nicd ) , aaa , aa or 9v rechargeable batteries
the price is fantastic and what it lacks in aesthetics , it makes up for in power and speed
when the batteries are charged , the light displays green and be warned that it is normal for the batteries to be warm
unfortunately there is no real carrying case for travel .
great for the 9volt and d but for aa and aaa it does not do as fast as the smaller rapid charger ones form energizer .
i use the cable at home on my home desktop pc
it is great for synchronizing my palm iiixe with my home and work pc
i use avantgo
com at home to add news to my palm ( which i can not do at work )
best of all it is cheaper then the cradle and it does the exact same thing
the only thing missing is the button that you get on the cradle
instead , you launch hotsync from your palm .
useful , versatile , lightweight , and convenient
this small lightweight cable is easy to travel with
use it to sync your laptop or connect to any other serial device
i bought it to use as a second hot sync cable to help keep by home computer and work computer synced
the full sized cradle is more expensive and less versatile
you can use it to turn your palm into a terminal , via a modem or direct connection
note : you may need a null modem adapter for some devices
for programmers , i think this cable is fabulous
it makes the palm useful as a programming interface for any serial device
the low cost of a palm and cable means any small serial interface device , like a voicemail system , can have a permanent or temporary display hooked up without adding a lot of expensive hardware , or hauling around a heavy laptop
i think this concept will increase the need for palm programmers and generate a new breed of palm based application interfaces with associated software
buy it if you need a method to sync to a laptop when travelling , or for an interface for a serial device .
i have to agree with other users that this is a great product , but it is not as practical as you may think
a usb sync cable is a better idea
talk about convenience
secondly , the cable is too long ! who needs 3' ( or 2' ) or cable to connect a palm to a laptop computer ? the reason why i am writing this review is because i haven not been able to find a usb sync cable
i called palm , there is none available
i visited the stores , there is none available
will anybody have the brilliant ( and obvious ) idea of creating this device ? ! i also write this review for those of us who use laptop computers with usb ports and don not want anything to do with legacy hardware .
don not travel with the cradle , and don not wait until you return from a trip to synch with your laptop
just roll up one of these and stick it in your laptop case
this is especially useful for palm viis , which can not use the version of palmos that supports synching through the ir port
this cable does not have a synchronize button
in order to use it , connect the cable , turn on your palm , press the hotsynch icon , and press the localsynch icon
remember that leaving your palm in the cradle or leaving this cable connected to both your palm and your computer will put an extra drain on your batteries , so you should unhook your palm as soon as you finish synching .
if you are going to sync from more than one computer , this is a far better option than buying an additional cradle
to offset the lack of the convenient button on the cradle , you get better portability , a lower cost , and can hook it up to palms that live in a carrying case without having to rip it away from the velcro .
though the palm iiixe comes standard with a hotsync cradle , that isn not something you want to carry in your pocket
this cable is the ideal solution if you travel or if you need to sync with more than one pc
the generous 3' cable length is perfect - better a long cable than one that is too short
keep in mind that this is not a usb sync cable , it is a practical serial device for the palm iii &amp ; vii , along with some of the older models
read the other reviews here and you will find other creative uses for this cable , so i won not repeat them here
you will also see that most of the owners who needed a serial sync cable agree - get this and you won not be sorry .
lightweight , portable and simple
these words describe both the hotsync cradle that came with my palm iiix and this cable which i just purchased
however , if you travel a lot , and sync to a laptop or second computer , this cable is the way to go
i takes up virtually no room in a laptop bag , and can fit in virtually any luggage pocket ( and also a suit pocket )
there is no other software to install
just pull the cable out of the bag , attach to your pc and palm and sync using the hotsync icon on the palm itself
one way that it could be improved would be with a button on the cable end itself which would trigger the hotsync
this would most likely make the cable more expensive and possibly less reliable over the long term , however
all in all , a and utterly useful product .
i received this dvd player yesterday 11/30/99 and my son tried to install it
he is not a genius at electronics
we called the toshiba service support line and were patiently assisted with the installation
this was extremely helpful to us
this is easy to install but if you aren not an electronic wiz , this is a very good asset
the dvd player itself seems flawless to us at this point
i would recommend it highly .
i have had this player for about six months
about <PERCENT> of the dvds that i own have at least one feature that can crash this player , when that happens the only way to reboot it is to hit the switch disk button , none of the other buttons will work
the remote control design is pathetic , half of the buttons are hidden by a cover , and are virtually inaccessable
the skip and fast forward functions are combined on a single key , to you must hold down the skip button for several seconds , if you don not hold it down long enough it skips to the next scene
the skip backwards function doesn not work , it can only return to the start of a scene , not an earlier one
so if you accidently skip to the next scene you must restart the movie from the beginning .
i can not find a compelling reason to recommend a higher priced model than this one
sound and picture as rich as can be
it is worth hooking up to a stereo system if you have one near your television
remote features are excellent , allowing for more tricks than you will use
chose this after too many negative reviews of low price sony models ( i am sure everything is fixed , but i wasn not going to take a chance over the holidays )
wasn not a toshiba fan before this purchase ( simple sony prejudice ) but now i am willing to spend the big bucks on one of their large tv is
you will enjoy this player and its price .
i own this dvd player
i just bought it in late march 2000
it is the first dvd player i have ever owned
the sound and picture are great with my dad is home theater
i am seriously thinking about getting one for my bedroom
i just bought a toshiba tv for my bedroom
for those of you who have problems getting rid of the zoom in the lower right hand corner , hit the setup button twice , that should get rid of the zoom
enjoy ! update 10/9/07i still have this dvd player and it works great !
this is an awesome dvd player
i bought it after doing a lot of research online and truly understanding how the machine works
it came down to this one
why ? zoom function : you can actually zoom in and look at minute detail on the movie and pan left and right on it
it also allows for "outside" angles -- meaning you can pan left or right while a movie is playing to see outside details from the center screen , if the director/dvd makers allow it ( which i am sure will be the next push in the technology )
speeds : the selection of scan through speeds is amazing -- all with startling clarity
resolution : i scoffed that a dvd could produce that much better resolution and clarity of sound , but whoa man ! this is amazing -- i truly am blown away with what kind of quality you get off this dvd player
compatibility/ease of function : this dvd player is so incredibly easy to use , you basically just plug it in and play a movie
finally : the dual tray for dvd play
this player comes with two trays to put in two movies -- which you will find with longer epics out there
it is simple to switch between on disc to the other , and it makes it awfully convenient for viewing pleasure
they should really bring this product back
it is the best out there .
this is a great dvd player
i like the dual disc operation of this player
you can put two disc in the player and just sit back and enjoy
it has every possible connection that you need
the sound is great , the picture is great
i do wish that there was more controls on the front of the player , like a menu button you must use the remote for all of the players functions other than play , stop , pause and forward and reverse
this play also reads hdcd is , but not cdr is which are rewriteable disc
you can switch between the two disc and the player continues to play non stop
i like the feature of changing the black level of the picture which makes the colors just pop
this a great machine and a must have .
if you are like me , you use two or more pc is over the course of a normal workday and you use your palmvx religiously
your palm already came with one cradle , but you really need an extra to ensure all your pc is are in sync
what more can be said
it is the same high quality and easy to use charging cradle that came with your palm
mostly a convenience thing for casual users , but for those who use their palms alot , you need an extra
pick one up now while they are still available .
i wanted a palm vx because i love the looks but finally settled on the palm 3xe for several reasons
1 ) the hassle of charging a vx when travelling is greater than the benefit of not dealing with batteries in general use
and a cradle or more expensive travel kit is needed for use with a second computer or travelling
2 ) the cost of vx accessories are too high
i liked the 3xe because i wanted to hot sync my computer at home ( 3xe travel cable is only $17 compared with $40 to $50 for vx ) with my computer at work where i used the included cradle ( free with purchase )
and 3 ) the bulk of the vx cases made them as big as the 3xe with included flip lid
and this cradle is $20-$30 on top of the price of the vx
the bottom line : the the nice looks of the vx cost $210 more with all the accessories like a case and travel kit
not worth it
i'd rather have two 3xe is .
found an old palm in my basement and wanted to get it working again
took a chance and bought this cradle to charge it and sure enough it booted up
i have no real use for either the palm or the charger but for as cheap as it was i got it
worked well .
i bought this palm v hotsync cradle as a replacement to my old one that had been stolen
the cradle itself works great
it is easy to install and required no extra software if you already the hotsync software installed
a good product .
what can i say ? palm products have always been of the best quality , and the palm v hotsync cradle is no exception
i purchased an extra cradle for use with another desktop , so i can sync with several computers
the cradle bottom is metal , and there is enough weight that it does not move if the cord has a bit of pull on it
a must buy for palm v ( x ) users that need to sync with another computer , or need one at the office and at home
whatever the case maybe , its very handy to have an extra cradle around .
didn not work for my device but it lit up and worked
i sent it back with no problem and a full refund .
it does what is advertised
charges palm v and is also downloads to pc
that i haven not been able to try as the plug on the end of the cable is female and the connection to my laptop is also female
need an adapter
the charger works great and if it came with a usable connection i would have given it a <NUM> star rating .
perhaps the only bummer with the palm v series is that they have a slow serial port connection , which takes much longer to sync than a usb port
i'd recommend buying the usb palmconnect kit instead , which costs about the same
shop around .
this travel kit takes too much space
if you would like to connect your palm v or vx to two computers , i suggest you either buy another cradle , or pack your cradle
a cradle takes up as much space as this travel kit , and it is better
remember you can also hot sync through the infrared port if you have a computer with an infrared port , but this drains the batteries a lot .
the item pricing was good however , i did not get to enjoy their uses because i could not get my palm pilot completely operational
something had expired ? .
i agree with others here
all the components of this kit work very well
i took my palm vx to italy and had no trouble keeping it charged thanks to the adapters
i felt safe doing it with the converter too
i know people who have damaged computer equipment by trying to make do with cheap adapters
the sync cord is great
i use it at work instead of buying another cradle
it would be nice if they sold this separately
in the end , my only problem with this kit is the price
it is a bit much for what you get
i suppose if you travel overseas a lot it will pay for itself eventually
occaisional travellers will just have to swallow the cost
do i hear any third party vendors out there ? ps : this would get <NUM> stars if it were cheaper and <NUM> stars if you could use the adapter plugs with other things ( they are made to be used only with this converter ) .
this is very useful addition for palm for people who travel internationally
unless you are someone who travels to all the corners of the world , you may never use some of the plug adapters
i particularly like the hotsync cable
i can use it for syncing the palm with my notebook
comes in a neat pouch too .
i travel quite often , and lugging around the weighty hot sync/charger cradel adds some pounds to my briefcase
with the travel kit , the charger and hot sync cable are seperate , and much lighter , without the stand like the cradle
works just as good as the cradle too
i like the fact that the charger comes with <NUM> extra plugs , which can be used for different countries ! great travel kit at a reasonable price .
like the previous reviewer , i also purchased the kodak nimh batteries and charger and have found it to be a improvement to the standard package
too bad nikon doesn not include this as standard equipment with its digital cameras
my wish list : an automotible adapter so i can recharge batteries &quot ; on the fly&quot ;
overall , a quality product that functions as advertised and provides good value for the money .
i bought these , and mine came with <NUM> batteries
. another note : it doesn not have an electric cord , just two that flip out and go into a socket
makes it very compact , somewhat elegant
but : its design is such that ( 1 ) it doesn not work well in a horizontal outlet , only in a vertical outlet , i
where the switch plate is a vertical rectangle
in a horizontal outlet , the box ends up hanging precariously on its side , prone to falling out of the wall
( 2 ) if you happen not to have the lower outlet open , it doesn not sit readily in the upper outlet because it is upside down so the weight of the batteries tends to pull it away from the wall
so far it hasn not fallen out in this position , but it is probably gonna some day
personally , i think a regular electric cord and plug would have been better -- i suspect kodak just wanted to save a few bucks , and calls it a &quot ; feature&quot ;
other than that it is okay , but why did i really spend this much money ? as long as it is ul listed , buy yourself a cheaper recharger from a major brand name , and make sure it is intended for nimh batteries if that is what you want .
for a slightly less price , you can get yourself a negative pulse charger
a negative pulse charger strips away sulfate buildup and gas bubbles that basically ruins any rechargable batteries
take a look at the maha c210 charger or radio shack cat pulse charger
they are microprocessor controlled so that you can not overcharge your batteries
with the c210 you can charge any type of battery ranging from 3v to 12v .
this kit comes with everything you need to 'go rechargable' with one of today is digital cameras
i use it for my nikon coolpix and have noticed that one full charge of the <NUM> ma batteries lasts times as long as the disposable alkaline batteries that came with the camera
full recharging takes about <NUM> hours
the plug on the back of the charger folds up into the unit so you can slip it into your pocket or bag with no problem and be rechargable anywhere ! overall , slightly more expensive than other units out there , but worth it
be sure to get <NUM> ma nimh ( nickel metal hydride ) batteries if you are going to buy extra batteries with it ; you will find all kinds of uses for them ( pager , penlight , handheld games , etc
it is a great charger
you can basically bring it to anywhere you go
but one advice , don not buy too many batteries , because most of the time you think that you really need a lot of batteries , but after you really bought a lot of batteries , you will realize that you don not need that much ! and regret about wasting money
and if you are out of battery , you can just charge them again , two hours after , they are full charged .
this is indeed a lightweight tripod , as advertised
i didn not expect manfrotto quality , but the head is a bit disappointing
the plate is somewhat fussy to get onto a camera and into the head
if you are going to mount a still camera and leave it stationary indoors , this unit should work passably , but beware if you are going to use it with a video camera : mine doesn not pan smoothly and wobbles quite a bit when using any controls on my canon hg21 or the rode svm mounted on top , or when people walk around nearby
this leads to shaky video , even with is , which in turn works against the compressibility of the resultant files
the tilt hinge is something of a disappointment , as with a still camera in landscape orientation , when fully closed the camera is slightly tilted
if one is needs are very occasional and don not require panning or much adjustment , this could be a reasonable buy
it is probably also fine for holding reflectors , mic booms , or lights
i think , though for video use i am going to invest in a slik or other unit around the $ range .
i used once
very bad quality
i bought a manfrotto tripod
i love it .
you simply can not beat this deal ! great little tripod ! does the job perfectly as a lightweight "" tripod
i do have another big , heavy tripod for windy days but plan to carry this one on hiking trails and long distance trips
just what i needed .
i got all excited since this was a very inexpensive tripod and the reviews were good
got the item and the first time i used it for christmas eve photosthe lever that releases the pan and tilt head broke off
other than that this is a good starter tripod .
this tripod is too short ( i virtually always use it extended to full height , including the head ) , too flimsy ( it struggles to hold my canon 400d still , even with a small lens ) , and difficult to adjust ( the same camera is virtually impossible to hold at much of an angle )
the removable head is also a bit flimsy
however , it is also light , and ridiculously cheap
don not pay more than $15 for it , and you won not be disappointed .
i am amazed with this tripod , it is light and east to set up
the bag is nice too
i can not believe it is so good for such a low price !
i received this tripod for christmas and i am totally delighted with it ! it comes with a case and is small and light enough for me to carry
in just a few days use , it has made a difference on my low light level and photos .
the only reason i give it <NUM> stars it is because i only paid about <NUM> bucks for it but it is a toy .
you can not beat the price for a full size tripod for your camera
great for taking pictures of low light settings , night shots , etc
since the tripod will keep the camera still and won ; t blur the shot
the only bad thing is the shipping on this is more expensive than the tripod itself ! still worth it for about $20 .
cheap plastic breaks easy , treat gently
the only positive thing i can say about this tripod is that it is very light and very cheap
i tried to use it several times - does it is job only if the camera is positioned right on top ( 90 degrees )
if you move the camera and change the angle the top stand twists and fall back under the camera weight
i was using canon powershot s3 is , which is really light
i can not imagine if you use it with a dslr camera
my final conclusion - it is good if you don not need to change the vertical position of the camera .
these teac drives are great
i have them for about <NUM> months and no problems
just remember - no cable comes with purchase so make so you have a cable .
does not work for 720k formatting
if you need to be able to format to 720k , this will not work
otherwise it works fine , but i gave it <NUM> stars because i am unable to use it and i hope others can be saved the trouble .
i was having sporadic problems with my old floppy drive ( also a teac ) so , suspecting the problem was with the drive itself , rather than the motherboard , controller , cable , driver , etc
, i went ahead and bought this one from amazon
well , it installed without a hitch , and now works flawlessly
file transfers are somehow much , much faster -- faster than with my drive at work , and especially compared to my old drive
funny that floppy drives don not carry x speed ratings like -- if they did this one might be an &quot ; 8x&quot ; .
this drive made it possible to read some old floppy disks on a new pc
the new motherboards do not have floppy interfaces .
win <NUM> detected device without problem
wrote to and read from multiple disks without an issue
great option for making a boot disk for older pc builds/resurrections .
good drive , seems to read floppies more reliably than an old internal drive that i was using to try to recover old data
used on windows <NUM> x64 with no drivers or installation needed , just .
i recently found a couple of floppy disks with documents on them that i thought had been lost for ever -- the disks were 20+ years old and in a fireproof lockbox ! -- and i had no computer with a floppy drive that could read them
i wanted something inexpensive but which would work to help me recover the old docs , and this filled the bill
i plugged the disk drive into the usb port of my asus laptop running windows 7 , and the computer immediately recognized it
i held my breath and put in the first floppy
i opened the floppy from &<HASHTAG> ; my computer , &<HASHTAG> ; and there were all of my old documents -- which i was actually able to open and convert to a modern format
i only needed to use this drive once , so i didn not want to spend much money , but on the other hand , i needed something that would work , and preferably without having to deal with installing new drivers for it
this was perfect for my needs
i'd actually used some sabrent products before , so i hoped it would turn out to be a reliable drive , and it did .
not much to say here , it works for me
i was able to access my old floppy drives
windows detected it without needing to search for drivers .
the product was delivered on time and seems to work ok , albeit a little slow - but floppies are slow
i used this to transfer some data from an older xp machine to my new windows <NUM> computer
no problem as far as i can presently determine .
as others have mentioned , only works with 1
44 disks
out of curiosity , did try a single sided <NUM> and double sided <NUM> but no luck
works ok
build feels a little cheap , dive itself is pretty noisy
i ended up returning & simply using an old computer to read floppies
if this is your only option worth giving it a try .
needed a drive for some of my photos that are still on disk
this one was cheap , but very difficult to eject the disk
not satisfied with this at all .
does not work with win& out of the box - have yet to find anything to make it work - find an older machine ( xp ) and see if you can extract your data .
work well right out of the box after computer searched for and downloaded drivers
only used once for single floppy with much needed data
durability unknown
price was right .
floppy drive was a great purchase
works on all my machines of varying 64/32 bit , operating systems , and motherboard configurations
highly recommend this to others .
i am impressed
i have windows 7 , and was concerned about it working properly
but , no problem , it comes with a disc , but of course , you don not need it for windows 7 , just plug it in and windows <NUM> finds and install the driver automatically and i was up and running in under a minute
this was certainly worth the price
i had so many 3
5 left over from the 90s
i had no idea any more what exactly was on them , so i just could never trash them
and , i am glad i didn not trash them
there was some great stuff on those things
laughs and memories
it is amazing how things have changed of the past <NUM> years
buy it , you won not be sorry
and an extra note , it doesn not pull up stuff automatically
you have to go thru your exporer and find the drive and open it , but if you have 3
5s you probably can handle that
cheers , great product .
the unit works flawlessly
unfortunately , many software applications that still require floppy disks don not recognize usb floppy drives
my app is one of those
i have a partial
i run the software as administrator and despite receiving an error message that no floppy drive exists , the drive starts working
go figure
the <NUM> stars represents a warning to the buyer to make sure that their applications recognize usb floppy drivers .
we needed a new usb floppy drive to put command programs for projects onto disks for a piece of equipment
this piece of equipment will only accept 720k dd disks for the project info
unfortunately this drive will not recognize 720k disks that already have info on them , it will not format them ( even through a command line with unconditional override applied )
i tested it with some hd disks as well just to make sure it was a hardware limitation and not a defect
the drive reads , writes , and formats hd disks ( although it is slow and noisy and seems to have some marginal head sensitivity )
had a client who brought me a 3
5&<HASHTAG> ; disk and told me he had to have the data off of it
never thought i would have to buy a floppy drive or even use one
crazy , but this did exactly what i needed it for even in windows 8
i figured when i plugged this into an 8
1 machine , windows would basically tell me , &<HASHTAG> ; what is this ? 1
44 mb , hahahah&<HASHTAG> ;
this device worked perfectly just connect it to the motherboard usb headers and your done windows <NUM> picked it up and it reads my floppy disks with no problems !
so you have your tax records on a floppy , and you need to get that data ! whip this bad boy out and you are good to go !
its great
did exactly what i needed it to do
works with mac mini
did not have any problems
: )
this usb floppy drive was purchased to allow me to retrieve some files that were still on /4" floppy disks ( yes , they were ancient )
my old pc had a floppy drive in it , but my new laptop did not
the drive plugged in and installed itself with no driver required
the diskettes were read quickly and easily and the data saved off to cdrom for storage
i don not know if i will ever need this drive again , but if i do , it will be available and ready .
my main reason for buying this drive was to process a few boxes of floppies ( i'd guess 200+ floppies ) and i am about halfway through
after unboxing i was able to attach it to my windows xp box and it picked it right up without any driver installation or administrative rights required
using winimage i was able to image aging floppies with &<HASHTAG> ; bad spots&<HASHTAG> ; ( and ignore them even if i couldn not find a way to do so automatically ) in order to retrieve data i wanted
i have only just started using it so i can not speak to its long term reliability , but if this drive dies before i finish processing the remaining 100+ floppies i will modify my review accordingly .
i was very happy with this drive
it di exactly as described
simplicity and speed of operation .
the drive i received was sabrent model fitted with a mitsui drive
the drive installed completely plug and play and operated without any further actions to install it
the operation is a bit querky on some disks , all of which must be high density ( hd ) 1
44mb disks
i had one problem and discovered the write protection slide tab was open
sabrent is latest manual
pdf , from their website , explains that the write protection tab must not be open ( so you can see through it -- for those of you that have not been through the glorious 3
5 floppy era ) for the drive to function correctly
also , i tried several techniques to get some floppies to work correctly -- right clicked on folder and selected open , ejected and replugged the drive without the floppy in it , and several verbal invectives
most of my photos , program data files and old program installation files seemed to copy easily , albeit slowly , onto the hard drives
overall , a good bargain compared to the hassle of trying to install a 3
5 floppy into the computer that wasn not designed to accept such an installation
also , the floppy is an acceptable media for transferring smaller files from computer to computer .
overall , this floppy drive is a great value
i have used it in both windows <NUM> and linux without issue
it presents a usb mass storage device so it doesn not need a special driver
the floppy drives of old were heavy , high quality , and made of metal
they were also very expensive
this floppy drive is lightweight and made primarily of plastic
it is made as well as it needs to be --- especially considering the very low price
personally , i wouldn not mind paying more for more floppy drive , but the reality is , there is no point
floppy drives aren not needed very often these days and there is no point in paying extra for a device that will get occasional use at most .
this same drive seems to be sold under many different brand names
obviously not very high quality , but i need the ability to transfer data by floppy disk to an older machine & this seems to be the only option
i bought 2 , <NUM> works ( for now ) and the other just wanted to reformat all the time , whether there was a disk in it or not
i guess i will order a couple more for spares .
i had an internal drive stop working on a desktop and got this instead of finding a new internal drive
it works great .
it would not work
the software would install properly
i will be returning the item
very disappointed in the product .
i guess it is hard to complain about any fdd device anymore as manufacturers discontinue the production of 3
5&<HASHTAG> ; floppy disks
this served a purpose but in the end run is just a desperate attempt to read all old floppies and move their info off to for more permanent storage ( until the begin to disappear as well ) using this with os x is a real pain , using it with parallels <NUM> on os x to recover or produce temporary fdds for win or apps is useless
win machine is the next trial ; but , on the front , this will always be a frivolous spend and a somewhat frivolous attempt to resurrect aging and probably bad fds
the sabrent external usb 1
44 mb 2x floppy disk drive was exactly what i was looking for
it works perfectly and saved me from destroying all my saved <NUM> 1/2 floppy disks .
i have had this product for about three months now , it works on several media types just as described
i would recommend it to anyone
this is used by me only occasionally , so i do not know about someone using it all the time .
works great
after all how difficult could it be to make a good floppy drive
i was thinking of getting a used one , but this one is cheaper and gives peace of mind
- compared it with sony external usb and found this one cheaper
- very sturdy , dropped couple of times but it still works
- very plug and play
- never gave me a chance to complain
- works comparaeable to my sony vaio integrated floopy drive
the one i ordered arrived not working
i see from the reviews that this happens fairly frequently
buying one of these appears to be a roll of the dice
update : after returning this item and buying a usb floppy drive from a different manufacturer , i learned that on my os ( windows 7 ) that the drive will probably not automatically appear
you have to open the start menu and choose computer , and then click the icon for the a drive , to "activate" the usb floppy drive
if you then the a icon , you can see the files on any floppy that is inserted into the drive
the sabrent drive may well have been a fully functioning drive ; i just didn not know about this little workaround at the time .
works like a charm
i have used it on two computers and it has worked well on both
i am able to transfer data from the floppies to my hard drive
i would recommend it .
fabulous product at a great price
a very simple &<HASHTAG> ; plug 'n' play&<HASHTAG> ; way to transfer all those pictures that are on floppy disks
after purchasing a cheaper reader for eleven dollars including shipping that just didn not work on windows 7 , i got a refund and purchased this instead
it was twenty dollars with free shipping
as soon as i plugged it in it worked
i read a good dozen floppies without any issues and was able to transfer the files i needed to my hard drive
i do recommend this however if you are using windows <NUM> i will give you a few pointers
first off there is no install disc , simply plug into your usb and it will recognize the device
it will show up under devices and printers so you need to go to start and click on devices and printers and then click on the usb floppy reader right click and open and it should be drive a
you will more than likely need to do this for each floppy you put in
it may take up to a minute to read the entire floppy it is not as quick as a standard external drive or usb stick by any means
however it will read your old floppies and if you wish you can even transfer files to it and take it with you
bottom line , this works great you just need a little patience .
these little things can be lifesavers
in modern times , a floppy drive is nearly a dinosaur , and the majority of new computers don not &<HASHTAG> ; waste&<HASHTAG> ; space on them
that is sensible , as they are seldom needed
however , there remain those old &<HASHTAG> ; sacred&<HASHTAG> ; files long ago squirreled away on floppies , and their loss can upon occasion be a catastrophe of sorts
these little drives are totally up to date with usb connectibility , and cost next to nothing
i have been grateful to have carried one ( a sony ) in my briefcase for many years
this one was purchased for an associate who needed to transfer files from an older commercial graphics machine to alternate locations .
easy to install ( just plug it in ) and you have instant floppy
i have a few old photo disks that i wanted to copy the files off of and no computer with a floppy disk
very inexpensive but well constructed and works great .
easy hook up , does what it is suppposed to do
the price is nice too ! a lot of us 'old timers' still got stuff on floppys .
company replaced the item
so i raised the rating to <NUM> stars
it makes keeping track of the cac convenient
the company makes one that is better constucted
recommend buying that one ,
easy hook up --- just plug and play
now that non of the newer computers have a floppy drive , i thought it was important to get a drive before they stop making them
i have a lot of old photos and documents stored on floppies and no way to access them , until i got this drive
i like it so well that i will probably order another one .
cleaning out my office after an almost <NUM> decade career i ran across dozens of old 1
44mb floppies
recalling that i had used several for photos in one of the original panasonic digital cameras i decided i had better take a look before i tossed them in the recycle bin
unfortunately my current computers both at work and at home no longer have floppy disk readers , so the sabrent external usb reader was an easy solution
glad i did because i found several photos i had forgotten i had
i have other sabrent products : usb3 sd and micro sd card reader and a usb2 external sound card
all three work as intended .
i never thought i would need to look at a floppy drive again , but lo and behold , a customer had some very important data stored on some very old floppies
this saved his data and his price can not be beat
not a bad addition to have for your toolkit for that rainy day .
does as advertised , performs well
worked flawlessly right out of the box
everything needed was already present in my wintendo <NUM> install .
the delivery was prompt , the item was packed well and the floppy disk drive was plug and play as advertised
i simply plugged into my computer using the windows <NUM> program and the drive self loaded the software which took approximately <NUM> minute
it was ready to use
i was able to transfer my pictures from the floppy disks to cd is enabling me to view my old pictures which i hadn not seen for a long while
i would , at this point , recommend the sabrent external floppy disk drive as i am very satisfied with the product .
arrived on time , in good shape , and works without hassle on windows 7
we need 3
5 for our business machines and this fits the bill .
i had a bunch of photo disks that i wanted to upload
and this product fit the billinstallation was plug and play - and the product worked flawlessly .
it works fine
just plug it into a usb port and it will allow me to access old floppy disks .
i still have some floppies that i need to look at occasionally
this device makes that possible
it seems to work with any pc
my new computer has no 3
5 inch floppy drive , but i still have several such floppy disks with data i wanted to retrieve
this disk drive read the floppies just fine so i could save the data directly to the computer
this drive is a little slow , but it gets the job done
for the price , it is a great and very useful buy !
i used this external floppy disk drive to recover some photos and documents that i had from back in the dos and windows 3
1 days
it read my disks just fine and i was able to transfer everything to my new system .
when you need a floppy disk for an older computer to update bios , this works great
portable , windows and the bios saw the device without any problem
no brainer purchase if you are going to work on older computers .
works well on both osx and windows 7 , haven not tried it on linux yet
now i remember how slow floppy disks were .
works well , for the price
occasional miss read
unplug and try again fixes the problem
just was trying to recover some old files i found
did the job
cheap enough .
thesabrent external usb 1
44 mb 2x floppy disk drive ( ) blackis a totally plug and play device which operates perfectly under microsoft windows <NUM> ( x86 and x64 ) , and also gives the user a straightforward way to boot up modern pcs from diskettes , provided that the unit is connected directly to the motherboard , with no intermediate hubs , i
the drive must be connected to the usb ports on the back of the pc in order to be bootable
note : when using the drive under microsoft windows 7 , sometimes a prompt will come up saying that the diskette is not formatted and asking the user to format it
if you know the disk might have useful data on it , cancel the prompt and open up the windows explorer ( windows key+e ) to let windows reread the disk contents , and voil&agrave ; , the disk contents will be presented promptly in the explorer window
i am pretty sure this behavior is due to windows 7 , not the drive , since using it under xp didn not exhibit the symptom and , certainly , booting the pc from the same diskettes ( which i have already done ) wouldn not be possible if the drive couldn not read the disk .
i bought this to use for work and works great , i have had no problems and i like that its plug and play .
everyone in a while i get a customer that needs/wants to read old floppy disks
this drive is great for the money and installs in windows <NUM> and <NUM> without drivers
good drive !
i bought this to transfer very old floppy files to a thumb drive
i plugged the usb drive into a windows <NUM> 64bit computer and it was immediately recognized
this was a transfer , it worked and i won not use it again
dealing with a floppy made me appreciate modern data storage
god love anyone still using floppies
they have the patience of a saint
file transfers are slow because of the old technology , not the drive
the 4th star was for the easy plug and play , otherwise my rating is a neutral 3 .
i received a defective one the first time and it would take forever to load any file or it wouldn not load it at all
so we contacted the company through amazon and they sent us another one free of charge
the second one works just fine and have not had any problems with it
it is nice being able to save all my old files on a computer and not having to lose them
it also works great for if you want to install an old operating system on another computer that doesn not accept floppy disk .
i plugged it into my computer and
tried it in several different computers ( windows <NUM> and windows 8 ) and the device is completely dead
will not be recognized by computers
the worst part is i cannot return it as of a few days ago
i would recommend trying a different brand .
plugged it in , popped in a disk and in a couple seconds the disk appeared on the desktop
shockingly mac os still has actual icons for a floppy disk built in
highly recommended if you need to dump some old files off floppies
the only minor downside is it makes a hum/whine while idle with a disk in it
i guess that is the price you pay for 2x the rpm .
works as expected and is nice considering that even if you have an old floppy , newer motherboards don not have the connector anymore .
 <NUM> star because it doesn not work
apple : <NUM> imac - drive won not even register , just clicks away
apple : <NUM> macbook air - same as above
ms windows <NUM> on a <NUM> acer laptop : pulled up directions at mfr
model number not found - it is under
anyway , plugged drive in ; windows <NUM> installed the driver ; checked to ensure it &<HASHTAG> ; mounted&<HASHTAG> ;
i even had windows search for an updated driver
nope , the current one is good
then the fun : inserted a 1
44mb floppy disk with data ; the drive did not activate any windows &<HASHTAG> ; window&<HASHTAG> ; like a cd/dvd does
i had to bring up windows explore to view the drive
clicked on it , the drive actuated - click , spin , zoom , zing , the green status bar showed progress ! but alas , message window ! this disk in the drive is not formatted
insert blank floppy with the tab set to unlock
again , had to select from the explore window
again , click , spin , zoom , zing
oops , disk needs to be formatted
select okay
now it was hummin'
windows green status bar once again showing progress - the drive is spinning - green light on - then stop
then a new window pops up with formatting options
all fields looked correct so i selected the format button
one more time for click , spin , zoom , and zing
then stop
new window - windows cannot format the drive
several attempts followed to get this thing to work
shut down the pc
booted with the drive connected - no dif
tried different usb ports - no dif
ms windows <NUM> on a <NUM> toshiba laptop : see above
i am not sure what is up with sabrent and their models
i purchased the
there is no manual on their website for it
there is for the , though
i took a chance on a product that had <PERCENT> negative reviews ( 39 out of <NUM> were <NUM> stars and below )
the fares no better with <NUM> out of <NUM> reviews rated <NUM> stars and below
that is <PERCENT> ! guess i will keep looking
bottom line - it is going back .
buried deep within the user manual ( available online at sabrent is web site ) is the troubleshooting observation that you must wait &<HASHTAG> ; one full minute&<HASHTAG> ; ( use a timer ) between plugging it in and inserting a 1
44 mb floppy ( it does not support any other density )
follow that directive and the device will work pretty much like any ordinary floppy
before reading that directive , i was about to join those who swore the device would not work at all
it had repeatedly failed to read any floppy
the only other problem i have encountered ( in only <NUM> hour of testing ) is that the device driver ( written by microsoft ) hung on one occasion , requiring a reboot to resolve
i would also note that the user manual available online is for a teac drive while the drive they sent me is a mitsumi drive
that said , the teac user manual seems entirely applicable to the mitsumi drive
but , if you search the sabrent web site for the model number of the mitsumi drive ( ) , you will find ( at this time ) no information on that model number at all .
no problems with the drive , delivered as promised , good price
this really has saved me as i have some old <NUM> 1/2 diskettes that have photos on them and no working machines with a drive to read them .
i was talking with a friend last week about computers and the conversation got onto floppy disk drives and how no one uses them any more
however , and old timer like me has many files still on floppy discs , both 3
5 inch and a few <NUM> 1/4 inch
that got me to thinking about what i could do about them
i have an old fdd/ reader that the card reader works with windows <NUM> but the fdd won not
so i searched amazon and came across the sabrent
i read the customer ratings , as i always do , and saw that many people said it worked with their windows <NUM> and even windows 8
so i ordered it , received it , plugged it in and within a few seconds windows <NUM> said it was ready for use
i popped in a fd and heard the old familiar whirring noise
i on computer and there it was ! i on it and heard the drive reading the disk and saw my files display
how weird the young ones would have probably thought if they'd seen my face when it worked
now i don not have to worry about the hundreds of floppy discs that i have not been able to read for the last few years
i haven not tried it with the discs as i don not think i have any
i learned long ago to just buy the 1
44 mb discs as they were more
now to copy the discs to my computer and then back them up to cd/dvd/external hdd
note : nothing on the package mine came in says it is compatible with any particular version of windows
it only shows &<HASHTAG> ; windows pc compatible&<HASHTAG> ; , &<HASHTAG> ; mac os x compatible&<HASHTAG> ; , usb 1
0 compatible and hot swappable
now , about the 5
25 inch discs .
if you have old 3
5&<HASHTAG> ; floppies laying around but don not want to toss them before checking the content , this drive is absolutely perfect
just plug it into any usb slot and windows explorer will see the drive without any drivers , and it even works from the from the front usb slots
i have tried it on a winxp system and on a windows <NUM> system , and it works perfectly on both to read and write to the floppies
the price is great as well
i have some old internal floppy drives still , but motherboards no longer come with the connection for them , unless you want to install a 3rd party card to connect it , all of which would be much pricier than the cost of this drive .
this unit seems to work great
i was able to read all but three of my <NUM> floppy discs
not sure why the three wouldn not read
might be their age
but the sabrent floppy drive was great
it worked from the usb power .
it works and it doesn not
the product itself works and yes it works with the operating systems but it didn not work for my needs
i had old floppies from and xp machine and wanted to get data back
with this i kept getting a message that there was no data on the floppy disks which i knew not to be the case ( yes , i am aware of degradation of floppy drives over time )
i did some research and determined the issue was that the hardware is too knew so it doesn not recognize some of the older floppy disks
i managed to find an old machines with and internal floppy drive and did get the data off the floppy disks
all but <NUM> of the disks resulted in data retrieval
so while this actually works ( drivers install , shows up as a valid drive , etc
) it really doesn not
most anyone purchasing this is trying to get data off old floppies which this didn not do for me .
i thought for the price it would be a complete kit
it is oem ! it is just a bare drive , no cable , no driver , manual - nothing
if you know what you are doing or are replacing an old floppy it will do , but you can find bare drives for a much much cheaper price elsewhere
they should put that it is oem in the description .
never thought i would actually buy a floppy drive in this day and age , but when a friend came to me , asking for help with stacks of floppies that contained baby pictures taken with a sony mavica back in the day
i did
discs would not read at all in any of the <NUM> xp computers at work that still had floppy drives
errors and &<HASHTAG> ; format disc ? &<HASHTAG> ; options
but no reading what so ever
bought this and plugged it up to my win <NUM> machine
and first disc read like a charm
other discs popped errors , but after reinserting/opening times , all would eventually read , and i was able to retrieve <NUM> of a total <NUM> pictures from the stacks of discs
can not say i will ever use it again , and it did take a little wrangling and a lot of time
but $14 isn not much to spend to retrieve priceless memories from <NUM> yr old floppies no other drive would read
money well spent .
i like this product
just know that if you have labels on the floppy disk , more than one , the disk will get stuck on ejection
the tolerance is too tight in that regard .
this review is for the sabrent usb 1
44 mb 2x floppy disk drive ( ) black
it is a well built , quality floppy disk drive that comes with a hardwired usb 2
0 cable for connection to the computer
there is really not much to say except that it works ---- simple setup , plug and wait for drivers to load and install --- then use the drive
how hard is that ?
it doesn not work with dd disks , only hd disks
we had a few of the former and we had to decide to just give up on them
it mounted fine on a macbook , and even transferred our old system <NUM> mac disks
we did get a defective one first , but amazon replaced it quickly enough .
works well and allowed me to transfer all old data off floppy
now i can get rid of old computer .
* it is indeed plug and play
i just plugged it into the usb on my lenovo laptop ( windows 7 )
i was able to view every file on numerous floppy disks
* great price
if you have some old , old floppies around , i recommend getting this little beauty
you might have some wonderful old files/memories you had forgotten about on those floppies .
i plugged the drive in and my win <NUM> pc indicated it was downloaded a driver
after that i could read and writes files just fine
it does have an annoying habit of refusing to eject disks with labels on them
i have had to simultaneously hold the eject button and extract the disk with tweezers .
this is a well made floppy drive that has no apparent issues that could have crossed paths with me or the application i put it in .
work great
was terrible did auto connect and was complete waste if time thanks for telling it doesnt always work good going
worked out of the box with my macbook prodoes not eject with computer command , must manual ejectnoisy - with no disk in it sits there and &<HASHTAG> ; thunks&<HASHTAG> ; loudly about once a second ( which means i will keep it unplugged until i need it ) which is a pain since i was setting up a usb hub to make easy
( with a disk in it it is quiet , but not sue how happy it will be when pull the hubs usb from the computer ) have only tried reading
works very well
not the greatest sound but it is just the thing for patio parties , etc
make sure to read the manual first .
excellent purchase for the price i paid
works great sending signal from my computer to outdoor location ( approximately <NUM> feet through a wall with window )
it is a little testy when i first turn it on , often requiring slight adjustments to the tuning to find the proper signal frequency
every once in a while i think uncontrollable outside static also causes issues , requiring me to readjust the frequency on the transmitter and receiver
but once working , i have rarely had to make adjustments--and it plays just fine for hours
i have not used batteries yet , so i do not know the life when playing music without ac
but overall , it has been an excellent purchase and far simpler than wiring outdoor speakers , at least for now .
wish i read the reviews here more completely
this was a complete piece of trash
like with others , the speaker would not play for more than <NUM> seconds at a time no matter what i did
after a while i could feel that the speaker was over heating so i left it unplugged
sure enough it came back and played for another <NUM> seconds and then quit
it is going back to amazon immediately !
i wouldn not waste my time on this product
the range isn not nearly what was advertised
it says <NUM> feet , but i can barely get them to work across the room
it is even worse in a house
god forbid if you want to have the transmitter downstairs and the speaker upstairs or outside
they are prone to hissing and popping and my set has an annoying , whine
even the slight motion can interfere with the signal
i should have returned them when i had the chance .
just hooked it up and it works great
we have got the reds game on the television inside and the audio coming through the speaker outside so we won not miss anything ! so far so good .
the sound from the unit is descent given the size and construction
the wireless system , however is pretty bad
in an urban area you might be able to get 20' , but even then you will get periodic interference
in a more rural setting it becomes moderately usable , with more like 40' and fewer blasts of junk .
on the first try the outdoor speaker played for <NUM> seconds then stopped working
i returned to amazon ( no charge ) and got a replacement speaker
opps , same thing , the speaker played nicely for <NUM> seconds and then went dead ( the speaker sounded good for the brief time that it played )
i emailed amazon
com and wanted to role the dice and give it a 3rd try
amazon responded by saying that the problem with the speaker was more widespread than originally thought and they would not be able to send me an additional one
they refunded all my money also gave me a $10 credit in my account for the hassle
i was surprised to see the same speaker still for sale on their site two weeks later especially if there is a manunfacturing defect , the speaker goes dead and they know about the issue
should i give the speaker another try ? i really did like the product if it would only work
i have searched the customer reviews and this problem is not isolated to me
well , if you order this product save the box and packaging as you might very well be returning it after <NUM> seconds
it seemed like a solid product but at the low price of $32
00 , i am not surprised it failed to work
please leave feedback as i would like to order anothrer myself , but the hastle of returning defective products is a pain no matter how easy amazon tries to make it
also , i wanted to mention that it was very generous of amazon to give me a $10 credit for my troubles with the speaker
com is a very reputable company i recommend them strongly and i will continue to buy many prodcuts from them now and in the future
best of luck with this one .
i love the digital music channels provided through my cable tv service , and i wanted to be able to listen to this music outside
i just got so sick of dragging the boom box outside during dinner parties or while gardening and then having to fuss with changing cds--especially when i had great music playing inside the house
the speaker has exceeded my expectations
if you read the directions carefully and follow them , you will have good sound outdoors , too
i was up and running with tunes oustide within ten minutes
i needed another five minutes to fine tune , which was easily accomplished by reading the instructions and the troubleshooting guide
( if you refuse to read instructions or to show a little patience , you get what you deserve
) contrary to what you may have read in other reviews , if the unit is set up correctly , the sound is not thin
the bass is substantial and even with the volume set to maximum , there is no distortion
i set up the speaker ( loud ! ) and strolled my entire yard perimeter , as well as the far side of my neighbor is yard , and could hear everything perfectly
i used the cordless phone right next to the unit--no problem
the distance from my stereo to the backyard is the entire depth of the house--about <NUM> feet--with signal passing through several plaster and brick walls
i found that it is important to place the transmitter up as high as you can
that solved the few little sound problems i had at setup
what can i say ? it sounds great and i love it .
i was pleasantly surprised at how easy this unit was to set up
within <NUM> minutes , i had the unit set up and playing on my back patio
no static or distortion on cd or radio once i &quot ; tuned&quot ; in the box
unit sounded great with a balanced mix of bass and treble
make sure that the speaker is sheltered outside since the instructions explicitly state that it will not handle excessive rain or wet weather !
although i own two indoor advent wireless speakers which are excellent , this one is horrible
constant static whether from a radio or cd
it has trouble tuning to the stereo although it used the same transmittor ( 755 ) as my indoor speakers
actually it was closer to the stereo
but it never held a sound regardless of position
i am going to buy a third indoor speaker , use it on the screen porch and occasionally on the deck
much better sound with speaker and tweeter .
being able to enjoy music with a wireless speaker is fantastic
the speaker is small enough to be innocuous but delivers pretty good quality sound
on occasion , especially very humid days , it is harder to get the receiver to pick up the signal , but overall we are happy with the product
if you can buy the speaker at a deep discount , like we did , then you will be happy with the product .
works fine for my purpose , a wireless speaker i can move wherever i want to listen to my main stereo
i use it in the kitchen and by the pool , which are not wired for my stereo
sounds about as good as an inexpensive boom box and has a good range .
and look for another wireless speaker , because unless you are overwhelmed and enraptured by the audio quality delivered by a "close and play" or an eight track , you will be disappointed
and this is shocking , because usually advent makes great speakers
to give you a sense of perspective , realize that i do not demand or own end components
my entire cost less than <NUM> dollars ( includes : amp , <NUM> cd changer , dvd player and <NUM> boston acoustic floor speakers )
i purchased the aw810 unit to play light jazz or rock ( i am over <NUM> -- ouch ! ) , out on my deck
i thought it would help take the edge off the day ( the music , along with an extra dry martini )
instead of being smoothed by the sounds of miles davis or the dead , i found myself constantly running to the speaker to retune it ( oftentimes causing me to spill my drink -- ouch again ! )
net/net : 1 ) sound is thinner than a razor blade2 ) range is abysmal -- and you actually have to "tune" the speaker to get reception3 ) my unit turned orange after being exposed to sunlight for a week ( i am not kidding ! ) 4 ) the volume of this unit can be drowned out by a snoring cricket5 ) this speaker simply does not meet the high standards that advent has set for their other speakers
overall i am satisfied with this purchase
for the first hour or so , i was extremely frustrated with this product
i tried changing the frequency , the volume of the transmitting speaker , and the location of the wireless speaker a few times , with no luck , no sound
after some fiddling it would transmit sound for about one second and then go silent
it finally sounded like it had blown
it got very loud , very staticky ( sp ? ) , and then went silent
the power light turned on and off
it did this about three times
i was about to give up
i gave it one more go , and it worked ! i kept the frequency , and even moved the speaker a couple of times to see how it would operate
it is still working
it is not a high end speaker , but for the price , and what i am using it for
i am very pleased
it does what i bought it for .
if you are looking for the best camcorder in the market , stop looking this little toy has it all
the quality of the picture and sound are so great the you will feel and see every thing that you filmed as if you where there live again
if you have a home theatre system with adobe digital 5
1 you will really see what i mean
the only down side is you will need a battery that lasts longer and make sure you get more tape .
i have played with this digital camcorder for about <NUM> days now and i am delighted with it is quality and features
if anyone is disappointed with the quality of the video ( see reviews below ) , they are probably being unrealistic in their expectations
to get better video , you'd have to go up to a 3ccd camera ( at about 3times the cost ! )
as for those who say that the camera is too big and heavy , i say just try shooting a still video without a tripod with a camera as small as a paperback book ! you need something larger to get a good steady picture ( even with &quot ; steadyshot&quot ; )
i appreciate sony is innovative digital <NUM> because the tapes are less expensive , but you still have the quality of digital recording ( the pauses are terrific ! )
i am not worried that these tapes are not interchangeable with the format
i mean , how often would i want to trade digital tapes with someone ? i also have the option of playing back any old <NUM> or videotapes that were previously recorded , and converting them to digital ( try that with a camcorder ) ! i like having a/v outputs and inputs so that i can digitally record from a source other than the camera lens
the sony infrared &quot ; nightshot&quot ; is astounding
it is like have nightvision goggles for your camcorder ! the lcd screen on the trv310 is wonderful
5 inches ! the 20x optical zoom is sufficient , and going partway into the digital zoom ain not too bad either ( as long as you don not try to actually use the full 360x ! ) i cannot say enough good things at this point
if i have to find something negative to say , i wish some of the controls were in easier locations to get to while i am still filming
all in all , a nifty camcorder that i highly recommend !
i have had this camcorder for <NUM> years and i am still happy with the purchase
for myself being a big guy , i was never comfortable with the tiny minidv camcorders out there , and the size of the digital8 camcorders is a nice fit in my hands , without being too large and heavy for my wife to use comfortably
i have not had much chance to do comparison testing , but the picture quality is very good
in some cases i might think the color is a bit undersaturated , but i prefer this to seeing colors pushed beyond what they should be
i have no complaints about the sharpness of the video
in very low light the picture doers become grainy ; i suspect that new camcorders out there may do a better job in low light than the trv310
one thing i really like about this camcorder today is that it seems better built than the digital8 models than sony is currently producing
in addition , the lens is a bit larger on the early digital8 models , so low light performance may actually be better than the current ones ( but i have not done a comparison )
i also will recommend the trv130 for video editing ; i have had no problems loading video off of the camcorder onto my windows xp pc with a firewire cable
my complaints on the camcorder : 1
still uses tape , which can jam up inside the camcorder ( luckily i havent lost a tape yet )
i have also been told specifically to use *only* sony hi8 / digital8 tapes with this unit
there is a manual exposure setting , which is good for shooting candlelit scenes , etc
but the camera is missing a manual white balance that i wish it had
the white balance is done automatically when the camera is turned on ; when indoors with natural light i will point the lens to a blue object at powerup to eliminate a bluish tint to the picture ; likewise if the indoor scene is lit i will point at a object to eliminate everything looking orange
the supplied infolithium battery is useless
i which sony would include one of the larger batteries as standard
as mentioned above , low light performance could be better
the low light settings the camera provides are rarely used
altogether , i am very happy with this camcorder .
well , i had read all the reviews of this model on amazon and based my purchasing decision partly on this information
i expected picture quality from the <NUM> to be at least as good as my old pal sony 8mm
however , after <NUM> weeks of using the <NUM> we had to conclude that it simply provides inferior picture quality in most lighting situations
inferior in both colour reproduction and in clarity , whatever the technical specs
for example , i have a coat with a maroon sleeve but this appeared bright red whatever exposure or program setting i used ; same with the shop model we checked with when returning the purchased unit to the store - it didn not appear to be just a snafu with the particular unit we had purchased
we also compared the <NUM> picture with the supposedly inferior panasonic <NUM> and both colour and clarity were actually better on the latter
why ? what is sony playing at ? we were expecting twice the clarity ( &quot ; resolution&quot ; ) and <NUM> times the colour depth from this digital <NUM> camera , as widely advertised
what are they talking about ? when it comes down to it , its about picture quality , no matter what bells and whistles the machine has
boy , was i glad to get my money back !
this must have been the best handycam for the price when i bought it ! and i love the death out of it ! all i can say is that this camera would still be great if it were still manufactured , <NUM> years later ! if you find one someone who is selling this camera in good condition , by all means get it ! it is a great camera !
this very small compact radio plays very well for its size
i am able to pick up some really distant am stations and i am also able to pick up many shortwave stations only using the small built in telescoping antenna that it has
performance is not as good as my larger sw and ham radios that i own but all in all i rate it very good for it size and performance
this model is no longer being produced but you may be able to locate a used one that is in descent condition .
this is the only shirt pocket size shortwave radio worth buying
for this great price you get a pocket radio without any drift ( meaning the station you listen to won not change to another station because of a loose or faulty dial ) , great stereo fm on headphones or ear buds ( the buds that come with it are ok
buy a better set and get ready for great sound ) , good am reception , and shortwave reception that is adequate for the big international broadcasts like bbc but poor for most everything else
the speaker is only good for talk radio
for music , this is a tinny and tiny speaker ( about one inch wide )
if you want a pocket radio that also gets bbc , radio canada , and voice of america , this is the trick
listen in on good earplugs and you will be happy with your purchase
it also has a good vinyl case
the radio looks sturdily built and will probably last for years .
a great little radio
i used it on my flight from az to nh
the fm and am came in just great
not sure about the shortwave as i wasn not able to pick up anything
but then again , i didn not really try
i like the small size
fits in my jacket pocket
a smart looking radio
price is reasonable
con : the ear plugs are useless
will not stay in the ear .
i supposed location is everything
up here in alaska , i found this radio to be rather limiting if not almost useless
reception proves to be very weak , tuning isn not the most exact science here and quality of this radio wasn not very high
i brought this radio from rei and within a year , the speaker cover fell off ( they were just glued in ) and my tuner dial fell apart
needless to say , this wasn not grundig is finest effort
i did get good am/pm reception within the city limits but i can do that with almost any radio
sw modes were limited , even on a clear nights , on top of a mountain
its a weak radio , probably good in a very civilized part of the world but worthless out where you really need it
small size is nice but why carry a radio around if you can not pick up anything once the city lights are no longer in sight ?
i purchased one of these radios to listen to am talk radio while commuting
the am reception is 'good' but not great
it takes some getting used to the backwards tuning dial which goes high to low which is the opposite of most other radios
what i like best about it is that it is very small & sturdy
i believe i have had the same batterys in it for over a year now and have not had to replace them
it does not get heavy use as i said earlier the reception is not what i had hoped but still gets several hours every week of play time .
it is a very good radio for emergencies and grundid is an excellent name
i also believe it was on sale
it works fine and i recommend it highly .
i have used this product for about an hr now and its going back
can not stand its sound quality - one tone , shrill sound
hurts my ears
stay away from this one !
this is my first shortwave radio
so , not having anything to compare it to , this is a good radio
on the am/fm side , i am hearing radio stations i didn not know were available
on the shortwave end , i am amazed what is coming in
in the short time i have owned this , i have heard bolivia , cuba , and either french canada or some other french speaking nation , as well as many spanish speaking stations
if nothing else , this is a good "beginner" radio
yes , the reception on the sw side are a smidge in and out , but it is ok
at this point i am just in amazement at what i am able to hear
there may be better radios out there ; as i delve into this more , maybe i will get them
but this is good for me just starting out and is fairly easy to figure out .
looking just at the features , this is a good unit to get for a basic , portable am/fm/sw receiver
it has a good digital tuner , decent reception , an external antenna option for pulling in weak signals , etc
however the design of the unit has several short comings
the biggest by far is that it uses up the batteries when turned off ! leave it on the shelf , and in a few weeks it will be dead
to add insult to the injury , all the features that require memory ( channels , alarms ) are lost when the batteries die
the second is the construction is not very sturdy
the grill popped off of mine after a few months of regularly toting it around
and the telescoping antenna - like all - is a failure waiting to happen ( and it did )
i am looking for a unit that has comparable features , but is more sturdy , has better power management , and memory .
this radio is a great value in a radio
it is being phased out in favor of the eton/grundig e100
these days there has been a trend for radios with digital frequency counters like the grundig <NUM> field radio
while these radios are easy to tune and bandscan , they do not have any memory presets and the tuning drifts after a few hours based on temperature and humidity
the grundig yb300pe , on the other hand , is a true digital radio and has <NUM> memories
the memories are a boon for fm/am listeners like me who like to "channel surf" during the long commercial breaks on howard stern and the don & mike show
the direct frequency input is unheard of at this price , especially for a grundig
granted , this radio is no longer made in taiwan but mainland china ( the box actually says "quality product made in china" in big letters , possibly in response to the reviews it gets in the passport to world band radio book )
the extras that are included with this radio cost almost as much as the radio itself : a quality ac adapter that doesn not introduce that annoying <NUM> hz hum , a reel antenna , a carrying case , earbuds , and a lanyard that is actually really handy ( the radio is much smaller than you might imagine from the pictures )
it runs on <NUM> aa batteries for what seems like forever in fm , and only a little shorter when always in am or shortwave ( cheap aa batteries are included )
i can not really say that the speaker is useful for those who want to hear music but those folks are better off with the yb400pe , the larger cousin of this unit , or even sony
no is available but if you are serious about something like that you won not be buying a radio at this price , anyway
overall a good radio for am and fm digital preset channel surfers like me and the occasional jaunt into shortwave
a great clock radio for travelling , too .
my grundig 300pe was a christmas gift , 2009
one week later , it wouldn not turn on
( please note this is an updated review
my full revision and explanation is found below , under the astrix
) i have installed new batteries and it won not work on the external power source either
the "light" works , but nothing else will power up
this is frustrating , and sadly grundig when it was a product made in germany , was an outstanding line of radios
now that they are made in china , there is no reliability in the products
i'd suggest "buy at your own risk" and understand that this radio has a short
the audio quality ( while typical for a radio having a speaker this small ) was good
it had an easy time receiving a signal inside my home in a rural area , miles away from fm transmitters
my old sony portable radio ( which i purchased and took to russia in <NUM> in order to get shortwave broadcasts from the usa ) finally died after <NUM> years
the grundig ( when it worked ) never performed as well as my sony ( made in japan ) but i wasn not too disappointed with the performance of shortwave listening on this tiny radio
the sony would hold a station better and not drift as bad as the grundig and the sony had vastly superior audio , despite having a speaker about the same size as the grundig
* update
this grundig radio easily "dies" often after being powered off and left to sit idle for a few days
i thought a component had gone bad inside the radio and i was about to shoot a video to post on youtube showing a hammer crushing the darned thing because it "died
" however , i have been able to get this radio to working again ( on several occasions ) by pulling the cover off where the batteries go and discovering on my own , that there is a very very tiny reset button under the batteries
it has to be reset with a toothpick or a paper clip
when i reset the radio , it is like it comes back from the dead and works
but that being said , resetting this little monster is a frequent chore .
this radio has very good sensitvity to fm , mw and shortwave
its sensitivity is almost as good as my grundig 400pe , but some of the other specs aren not quite as good which i would expect for a receiver that is about half the price of the <NUM> pe
its power consuption is better than the <NUM> pe too
it is smaller size ( than the <NUM> pe ) , very good designed , easy to use controls , good sound quality along with an excellent read out offers a good value
i like this radio is abliliy to quickly get to the frequency i am interested in
this is a fine little radio--- four stars .
this radio has good sound for a radio this small with verylittle overload on fm
not quite as selective as the yacht boy 400 , but good
better than the sangean <NUM> and my sony walkman
the am is good for nighttime listening , but daytime listeninghas some interference
the shortwave reception is average , even though it doesn not cover all the bands
the thing i like most about this radio is that it is easy to carry around .
hello folks its vince the radioman
i have been a collector and a buff for many years , love to do compares
this radio is generally ok no major complaints
the tuner quality is good ( although you can only tune down to a 5kh increment )
much better quality than the g2000a
the sound is a bit brassy but clear
its a good little travel radio and for the casual user its certainly worth the money
i would rate this better than its competitor the sangean ats <NUM>
it has a little bit of a better tuner , better at noise reduction and it has an external ant
jack which is always a plus
not the best radio for dxers because of the 5kh increment but you can still get some fairly decent results
grundigs construction quality leaves a bit to be desired ( be careful its delicate ! ) but all in all not a bad little radio
if you get a sale buy it .
absolutely fantastic , my recorder stopped formatting my disks
i had used the recorder approximately <NUM> yr , after using maxell is dvd cleaner disk , all is back to normal
great product even a simpleton can use it , follow on screen instructions and you are home free .
it works for me
it also has a few extras such as audio/video tests
i don not have any complaints .
i purchase maxell products because they works
needed to clean the old dvd player
put the disc in and followed instructions
simple as that .
did exactly as it is advertised
be aware , however , that there is only one ( tiny ) brush on the disk
other brands have a few , or many ( if that matters to you )
i have always had good luck with maxell .
i was about to retire an old standalone dvd recorder , because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs
i bought this lens cleaner and -- voila ! -- the recorder is working again
super easy to use ( it is simply a dvd that you insert into your machine , and the menus tell you what to do )
highly recommended .
works great
for what i am using it for it works good
i liked the excellent price
i would tell friends about this product .
it is easy and comfortable to wear , not sure if it was just my product or so is made in general , but the cleaner disc is not fully adjusted to where the optical pickup lens is located ( by just two millimeters ) , and i can not taste good if it fulfills its job well .
i bought this as a cheap fix for my polk dvd/cd player , which refused to play disks that worked on other machines ( lots of screen freezes )
i inserted the cleaner per instructions , followed the instructions on screen but it failed to complete the cleaning process
ejected , tried again , same thing
on the third go , the cycle was completed
unfortunately , dvds continue to freeze
so , maybe the polk is a dud
in any case , the cleaner didn not fix it and it is tough to know which product is faulty .
this disc could not be read in either of my dvd players
refund requested
would not pruchase this item
do not buy !
i was in desperate need of a dvd lens cleaner
this is great
i was expecting something with more dust fibers attached
the wispy few fibers manufactured with the disc perform admirably .
560d : this is my first review of any product on amzn
i had to add a comment after reading the other reviews
i am not alone ! these errors have been a continual headache , and from what i see from the reviews , turning to sony will be to no avail
ah well , sony has lost a dvd customer
i have the wega which is a great picture so i am not uniformly prejudiced against sony products
and the dvd player when it has worked has been great
but the hitches have increased in frequency until lately i simply get no disc error
the reader scans back and forth for about <NUM> seconds until it gives up
and i am giving up , too
i am very surprised that a lot of people have this same problem
points to a generalized issue which i hope sony can take care of .
for anyone who wants to have total control over what you are dvd movies look and sound like , this is the unit for you
although the picture and sound are stunning
if you feel the need to make them even better , the <NUM> gives you virtualy unlimited control
and it will save the settings for two hundred discs
just pop the movie in and all your adjustments are recalled
but beware if you are moving to dvd after years with a vhs that flashed 12 : 00 , opt for a simpler player
otherwise , you will be paying for a something that you can not control
the sony <NUM> will deliver fantastic picture and sound , for $150 less
and , as far as the sync problems that many have reported , i have had the player for two weeks now and have had no problems what so ever
even after checking out many of the reported problem scenes listed in other reviews
dvd is the future of home video
don not take my word , just look around yourself
if you are ready to buy , don not wait
you won not regret it for a minute .
sony has sure come up with another great hit

let me get right to the point
when this dvd player was working , it worked well
good picture quality , reliable service , reasonable remote
when it worked
unfortunately , this particular generation of sony products falls victim to sony is perplexing high failure rate and infant mortality problems
after only six months of very moderate use , suddenly the unit refused to play newer dvds ( instead , displaying an &quot ; insert disc&quot ; message )
soon thereafter , we got the dreaded &quot ; c : 13&quot ; error on the screen and front panel of the player , indicating that the unit had essentially failed
now , i can play a few older , dvds , but not newer dvds
in researching the c : 13 error via google , it appears that sony refuses to recognize the massive number of people experiencing this problem
now , it appears that some lawsuits may be headed sony is way from some very upset customers
i am certainly one of them
so , caveat emptor
sony certainly is an innovative company , but their quality control and longevity engineering is woeful as evidenced by the huge number of failures experienced by this product
thus , i offer a resounding one star for poor performance by sony .
the sony is a great buy for first and second time dvd player buyers alike
it offers a tremendous combination of features and performance at a very reasonable price
i had a year and a half old panasonic dvd player that decided to stop working and i realize now that it really did me a favor
seeing and hearing movies on this sony has really opened my eyes and ears to all that dvds can offer
i mention ears because as amazing as the video quality is , the sound quality is what really blows me away ( and you don not need a humongous sound system to appreciate it )
you will not be disappointed by this product ! it provides very near the quality level of the sony reference ( at half the price ) and features ( inc
a jog dial remote ) that put it over the sony ( at least in my book ) .
i asked around to some friends before buying a dvd , and was recommended the 550d multiple times
the higher end models only give you changer control ( multiple dvd is/cd is ) but since i already have a cd changer , i didn not need to pay for that functionality
i have never had any issues with audio track and video track being out of sync , in fact it has worked perfectly
the remote control is intuitive , with multiple rewind and ff speeds
the slow motion also has multiple speeds , so you can go frame by frame with the jog function , or the system can move forward very very slowly front or back
full features , digital menus , most of the controls can also be done from the console of th machine itself
i play cd is in it all the time as well
optical jacks and svid and coax , really offer flexibility when connecting to your stereo system
i especially like the built in dts decoding and dolby digital outputs
very nice system !
i have had nothing but trouble with sony dvd players
this one is audio gets out of sync with the picture after the layer switch on dvds
my previous one , sony is , couldn not play the second layer of any dvd without skipping
i took that one back and the dealer couldn not get replacement parts from sony
i love sony is design and features , but i wonder about their quality anymore .
generally speaking , i love sony products
however , i have found that when they need to be repaired , they are never good for long
case in point was my purchase of this dvd player
it broke after <NUM> months with a c : 13 error
i took it in , and they shipped it back to me <NUM> weeks later
it then broke <NUM> 1/2 months in the exact same way
i took it in , and it was fixed for <NUM> months before breaking in the exact same way
it was out of warranty this time , but because it had been defective so many times they fixed it
well , you guessed it
now it is broken again
when the machine works , it is great
but it has broken too many times for my tastes .
i don not know about the rest of you but i have been researching products to allow me to play music for about <NUM> months and i have had a hard time making a decision
i have looked a mp3 , minidisc , and regular cd players
i finally chose to jump in and buy this mainly because i didn not want the mp3 craze to pass me by : ^ )
here is what i think : styling : look good
it is almost exactly the size of a cigarette box but the depth is about 3/4 less
the clippable pouch that comes with it is okay but you need to undo the velcro tie to turn it on and completely pull it out to vary the volume
the pouch is quite and probably saved me when i dropped it
it does feel and look durable
the blue backlit screen looks attractive
the mp3 file names scroll across the screen rather slowly but , again , a minor point
sound : apart from the miserable headphones ( my main problem was static as the headphone jack swiveled around the entry socket ) the sound is good to great
i wasn not looking for &quot ; knock your socks off&quot ; sound anyway but i am quite happy with it
the highest volume setting is not as loud as i'd like it but it doesn not bother me to any great extent
loading music : loading is quick thru the usb port
i use realjukebox plus ( the one that costs money ) along with an to manage music loading and i am very happy with it
i didn not like the rio audio manager but it works fine
setup was a piece of cake
very intuitive and fast
memory : 64mb allows me to place almost any cd i have in memory
i have a mixture of 128kbs and 192kbs sampling rates on my mp3s and at <NUM> a single cd is about all that fits on there
the expansion port for memory upgrades will come in handy
overall : nothing really to complain about
a nice little gadget that i am very happy with .
two quick negatives about this machine : 1
documentation is terrible
you will be hard pressed to find even the most basic instructions in the manual
software is buggy and will cause your system to lock up on occasaion
the player itself is very good
i would also suggest looking at the rave mp2100 mp3 player before you make up your mind
though this is a neat little machine , i am not sure that the usb option works as fast as it is touted in the promotional literature
recommended with some hesitation .
the rio <NUM> is a great mp3 player
it has all the features i wanted , pretty good battery life , and is a perfect size
pros : -basic , easy to use interface
-decent battery life , although not as long as the manufacturer claims
cons : -i hate the software interface
it is slow , unstable and poorly designed
i suggest you use windows media player instead to upload files to the device
-as of firmware version 2
15 ( availible from ftp : //ftp
exe ) , the player only supports additional smartmedia cards of up to 64mb , to give it 128mb of total memory
although this is a decent amount , 128mb smartmedia cards have gotten a lot cheaper
-there is no windows xp support with the included software
it will work with xp using 3rd party software , which , consequently , is better than the included software .
i still prefer my rio <NUM> and have yet to &quot ; upgrade&quot ; to any of the newer mp3 players
it is light , smaller than a deck of cards and easy to use
i used it primarily to listen to audible ( audio books ) while commuting and it has been flawless [with the exception that one time it refused to boot up properly , with a checkerboard screen]
a quick search at rio is website ( rioworld
org ) revealed a recovery utility , which i ran and recovered my rio is firmware
whew !
the rio is overall a great product
the buttons and &quot ; interface&quot ; on the player itself are for the most part intuitive ( though it took me some time to figure out the more &quot ; advanced&quot ; features ) and are easy to use , even when you are fumbling around in your pocket to change a song
the fact that the player is unskipable ( it is not like minidisc where they say it doesn not skip and it really does ) and extremely lightweight makes the rio the perfect exercise companion ; i take it on every run
for <PERCENT> of purposes , <NUM> megabytes memory is enough ( unless you are a fan of <NUM> kb encoding )
i can almost always fit ten or more songs on the player , and changing them is easy enough
so don not worry about the memory is enough
the software ( i use a macintosh ) is well done and makes it very easy to transfer songs to the player itself
the only thing i was less than perfectly happy with was the wait while the songs copy ( in the scheme of things , a very small flaw )
the usb interface was no problem at all , even on an older , less compatible imac ( revision a )
the headphones included with the player are neat looking , but not great sounding
the fidelity is low , with barely any low and sound
assume you will have to spend at least another $25 for decent
the only feature i feel the rio lacks is recording capabilities like the nomad
but again , no big deal
overall , a great product
i'd buy one for a friend .
simple to use , compact , one rechargable aa battery lasts more than <NUM> hours , great quality
great value
i enjoy it everyday .
in it is own world , the rio is great
just an mp3 player with <NUM> meg ram
needs better headphones , although they feel snug and secure
also , it would have been nice to have a recording feature with built in mic or input for a lapel mic
that would blow minidisk out of the water
i must say however that this is the future at its best
no moving parts , removable smart media cards used to expand memory
the future of music does not involve any motors of any kind to spin a disk
i have allready downloaded a ton of online books and music , and the quality is great
and remember , mp3 is can be be converted back to a standard
wav file with just about any mp3 editor
try music match
a great product david_carlin<MENTION>
does not work at all on my brand new pc ( 98se , usb ) , very bad software , support is helpless
advertised audible format is not actually supported ( 'yet' they say
) don not buy now
this is a rushed out ( though late ) buggy product .
i bought a rio500 and regretted the purchase <NUM> minutes after opening the package
to load software from the computer to the rio500 , you use the audiomanager software that comes with your rio
on <NUM> of <NUM> computers i tried the rio software on , the software failed to properly interact with the rio , popping up a dialog saying , "either your rio is busy or it has insufficient memory
try turning your rio off , then on again
" a brain dead message - i wasn not trying to copy anything to my rio , so memory isn not an issue here
diamond is tech support did find a that worked on <NUM> of the <NUM> failing computers , though
the reason i bought the rio500 is because memory is expandable using flash cards
more memory is good
also , i have some compact flash cards for my digital camera lying around
unfortunately , diamond opted to call their proprietary memory card , a flash card even though the memory is incompatible with any device using the standard compact flash card
the only reason i can fathom for the similar name is duplicity on diamond is part
the other reason i bought the diamond is for use in the gym
i grow weary of the classic rock at gold is and want some talking heads , lords of acid or maybe mozart
the carry case packaged with the player , however , is tedious
the fabric mesh case completely obscures access to all controls
in fact , while fumbling , i accidentally placed the rio into "loop this track" mode
how did i do this ? there is no loop button
several minutes of inspection , between workout sets proved fruitless
later , after i got home and read the manual - fold out pamphlet is more apt - i learned diamond overloaded the use of the
not only does the turn , but you press it for selections
if you have a sony handycam , you know the drill
however , while in the gym , the rio is interface had me baffled
i blame diamond for a bad interface
a classic problem in the field of computer science is the knapsack problem
the knapsack can store only some many units and given a selection of units , the problem is to optimize how much you place into the sack
the limited memory of the diamond is the knapsack
your mp3s are the items you place into the knapsack
unfortunately , when placing mp3s onto the memory cards , you have to select which card the mp3 is stored upon - either the onboard memory or the expansion
the audiomanager does not optimize for you
leaving you to figure out how to best use every megabyte on your rio
this lack of optimization is exceptionally tedious
looking at the specifications the diamond rio500 seems a winner , but after some use and field testing , i realize terrible mistakes were made
diamond duped me with their illegitimate "flash card , " the audiomanager isn not fully baked and the interface to the player isn not straight forward due to one button having more than <NUM> function
give this player a miss and wait for the 3rd generation mp3 players .
the diamond rio <NUM> is simply the best bet out there for anyone buying a mp3 player for the first time or buying one as a gift
it is also far and away the best bet for macintosh owners
as others have noted , the only downsides are the lack of an ac adapter and the horrible headphones that come with the unit
this may be a bit subjective , but the design of the unit itself is also a bit uninspiring
the unit is , however , extremely small , light , and portable
you won not mind taking it with you in your coat pocket , although i am not quite sure if it would be appropriate for jogging ( i wouldn not know where to put it )
don not be fooled by the packaging which is overly large and cumbersome , the device inside is smaller than it appears
oh , one last nitpick , battery life is pretty short
i would recommend using two sets of good rechargeable aa batteries , otherwise you will be buying new batteries every other day ! the rio is a lot like an ibm thinkpad
it is perhaps not the sexiest device on the market , and it is a little bit more costly than some other options , but it does everything a bit better than the competition and will last ( making that bit more you spent more than worthwhile ) .
not the smallest or best built , but not that bad
i am not disappointed
that is more than i can say for many mp3 players .
the rio <NUM> holds a decent amount of music , and the battery lasts longer than i expected
but best of all , it is mac compatible and the tranfer speed via usb is fast ! if you use soundjam on your mac , the interface is right through that application .
the documentation to get started is sketchy at best
i almost took the unit back and thought it was flawed because i could not get it to download to the recorder
ripping from a cd is fast , and downloading is also fast , but it appears that battery life might be a problem since it shows considerable use after a couple of hours
i also have a mini disk player and will not throw this away since it is more flexible in repeating songs and the disks aren not that big that they are a pain to carry
in essence , the price may be a bit high , but the quality is great and the unit is nice to carry
i am not sorry that i bought it since it is nice to download songs right from the net
diamond/s3 has created a major dud w/ this product
i will never again purchase another diamond/s3 product , nor will i allow someone to do so w/o hearing me out first
for starters - the box says that it is firmware is upgradeable to support higher memory capacity at a later time
then after we'd already bought it - they said they wouldn not upgrade the firmware past 32mb cards
a huge uproar came about from all the owners since other companies were supporting the 64mb cards
finally they relented
then the new rio is won not support the memory cards that you buy for this product
and memory is the most expensive part
there won not even be some sort of an expansion pack - the new rio is will use a proprietary type of memory which means you can not use it in your pda or camera - and you will pay a lot of money for it too
then , there product is highly bugey
crashing often , it has huge battery issues
for instance - if you are transfering data and the battery dies then the unit has to be reset at the factory
and this happens a lot because unlike other usb products that are powered off the usb bus , the rio drains batteries like crazy when transferring files
i end up having to put in a brand new battery every time i transfer files just because i don not want to deal w/ a factory reset
the usb cable - not sold anywhere so you can not get a replacement
you have to get 3rd party software to download mp3 is to the rio because what it comes w/ is useless
the cdrom it comes w/ has 3rd party software that you can only use for <NUM> days , thankfully musicmatch and realjukebox will take care of that
the rio500 will not be upgraded to support some of the new codecs ( wma ) which are half the size of mp3 is
the rio600 comes w/ it - so obviously they are recognizing that this new codec is the way to go , but they won not support their older products
and why not ? this &quot ; older&quot ; product is the most current product available by them to date
and it is not like after shelling out $275 for a unit , you are willing to &quot ; upgrade&quot ; to another player in <NUM> months ! are you getting the feeling that they have upset me a bit !
wow , what a frustrating product
the technology is so tantalizing , but the realization through the rio <NUM> is so that it drove me crazy
i am returning the product
some of the problems : o the software from diamond or from audible to program the rio is truly horrid , the worst software i have seen in many years
it crashes so frequently that you will be pulling your hair out
o the documentation is a joke ! the &quot ; manual&quot ; is two pages long
and no , the product isn not intuitive so you don not need a manual
look forward to lots of trial and error as you learn it yourself
actually , the hardware part is ok and the sound is joyous on those rare occasions when you can get it programmed
but for me , the trouble overwhelms the joy
i will be returning mine and looking at a creative nomad or some mp3 player .
the player is great , small , light and easy to use
you must either use a mac ( works great with itunes ) , the riositude program ( freeware , google for it ) or win98
i use mine whenever im outside : running , yardwork whatever
you will need to replace the earbuds but if you buy a used one do you really want to use someone else is earbuds ? the serial number will rub off so write it down as another reviewer suggested
also , if you buy a used one , make sure you get the usb cable
it is proprietary and you can not get it anywhere
( refer to rio support coments below
) customer support at rio ( or sonic blue or whatever they call themselves this week ) is a joke
i will not buy another product of any type from them ever .
this is a very well designed player
it shipped without instructions of any kind ( from audible ) but they are available on the web
mine doesn not play mp3s well , they sound fuzzy and distorted
as i use mine primarily for audio books it is not a huge issue
if you get one , check it right away for playing quality
i didn not and they won not allow me to return it now
my biggest complaint is it is sensativity
if i bump it , it resets to the beginning of the audio track or song
i don not know if their other products do this but this one is awful in that regard .
the rio <NUM> is great for gym workouts , train listening , etc
it is small , light and sounds good enough for listening in an environment with ambient noise
my biggest complaint is the rioport software
there is no simple way to download songs directly to the device from a folder or cd rom
instead , you have to import the songs into a database and then create playlists
if you move songs from one subdirectory to another , you have to manually edit database entries for every song that you moved--a tedious and process
if you the songs to the database after the move , you get duplicate entries , only one of which is valid
however , you can not tell which entry is the valid one
another gripe--after paying this much money for an audio player , it seems wrong to have to shell out another $9
95 to unlock the software
in short--great product once you get the songs loaded , but reaching that point is frustrating at times .
the rio500 is a great mp3 player - in this reviewer is opinion , the best on the market currently
its size ( smaller than a pack of cigarettes ) and weight ( about an oz
) recommend it to musicophiles and , especially , athletes ! ( you can jog all day with nary a skip , and with the included netting , it will definitely not pull your jogging shorts down , weighing about the same as a pager
) interface with any usb macintosh is seamless , and the included software , casady &amp ; greene is soundjam mp , is the finest mac application in decades
all you need to know is how to work the plug , and how to drag and drop , and you will be organizing your rio playlists with no trouble
if it isn not already , soundjam will become your mp3 player of choice , too
the rio takes smartmedia cards and can reportedly handle any size , including the upcoming 100+ mb cards ; mine works perfectly with a <NUM> mb sandisk smartmedia card
( 96 mb is just about perfect for listening to a full cd recording , say of beethoven is fifth , at <NUM> kbps sound quality
) i also get great sound out of a adapter , which i use to playback mp3 is in my car
my only complaint is that the included are terrible , both acoustically and for the fact that they just won not stay in ! alternative headphones can be used , but drain the power source ( 1 aa battery ) rather quickly
a solution might be nimh high capacity rechargables .
i think that this is one of the most used toys i own
great for taking in my car to have a fresh sound every week
great for taking for a jog or working out in the gym ( no skipping )
i only wish they included a ac adapter plug
plays music smooth and loud , great mp3 player !
very well made unit
great sound
connects via usb cable to pc
battery life is
good support from manufacturer
you can get firmware updates easily at their website
comes with a &quot ; card&quot ; , not a manual
but there is a good manual , and a printable version , at the rio website
provided headphones stink
you can get a nice leather case from the sonicblue website store
64mb stores a lot of music
i added 64mb card , which are coming down nicely in price
i have two rio500 is , one for music , and one for my audio books
decent headphone volume
display with latest firmware is sometimes hard to read
if you pull the usb plug during download , or if download is interrupted , the rio will lock up , good
but , sonicblue tech support website does have program you can download for free that will fix it ( usually )
this happened to me , and the program worked fine ! right now , i think it is good buy
the other rio mp3 players use expensive memory &quot ; backpacks&quot ; , or rechargable batteries ( rio800 )
i prefer alkalines
regular rechargable aa batteries are not recommended for the 500
i think it is a great unit
<NUM> stars easily !
i just recently received the rio <NUM> for a father is day gift
i wanted one to paly audible files so i was pleasently suprised to receive it
unfortunately i am returning it because the device doesn not live up to it is billing
the main problems : 1 ) low volume
even max'd out the unit doesn not have enough volume to drown out any background noise when listening to the unit in a loud environment
coffee house2 ) poor documentation and software
there is little documentation with the unit to describe the functions of the scroll wheel etc
you are on your own to figure it out
3 ) headphones- the very first day i lost one of the foam caps and had to have it replaced , only to have it fall off again a number of times
i called tech support about the volume problems and they just responded that the rio <NUM> has better volume
it was obvious that they were unable to talk honestly about the <NUM> since it is a product that is being phased out
having said all of this i did purchase the rio <NUM> and i give it two thumbs up
the volume rocks and it has more functionality to the controls and the layout
since the <NUM> cost over $100
and has only 32mb of internal memory it is more expensive but in the long run i think you will be happier .
i have a <NUM> and now a 500
there are a few reasons this unit is a big improvement
most impt is the usb connection , which makes uploading much faster and is conflict free
the software upgrades easily and the added memory capacity is thus doubled
if you download your songs at very high compression , sound remains good and capacity can exceed <NUM> hours
one suggestion : get real headphones !
this is great for jogging and sports , but for most , an hour of music isn not enough
if i added an hour more as in memory , it would cost me $150/64megs ! i spend at least <NUM> hours ( 10 hours max ) listening to music
while i could saved it for the new mp3 players ( capacity in the gigs ! ) arriving later this year , well that is what they said
people who will be using it for a short while every day should buy it , but downloading mp3s with a 56k modem is a huge problem
it is easy to use from buying it to using it
the size made me realize to get it , but i am still using cd players for the rest of the day
it did what i expected ( only jogging ) , but i rather have those with gigs as in memory instead of only megs
it is useless during vacations ! aaarrrggghhh !
i bought an unit simply to get the in/out plugs
now i can have just one wire ( ) going to my tv
the jvc vcr has a nice feature in that when you change channels up/down , included in the list is ( where i input from my dish )
so , after the highest tv channel it just goes to the dish input -- nice ! i don not need the tv remote except to turn the thing on
also , any time i want to play a tape , i just put in a tape and run it and it just takes over the tv picture
the instructions were not clear on the 'plug/play' hookup
it didn not seem to be working but i left it alone for a while and it was ok
it just needed to find the time signal from my local pbs station which is only sent once per hour -- i hope that is helpful
i haven not tried it with an tape
a complaint i have is that when useing et with a regular vhs tape , there is no indicator that shows the quality that it allowed itself to record at
one could argue that one could just observe the tape , post recording
however , i'd like to try a tape to see if that important movie will record on *that* tape in a high quality .
i have used this model for <NUM> months and it has plenty of audio and video ( including svideo ) inputs
it can record and play and vhs tapes , with the former providing superior playback using the recording mode and an tape
it auto detects the tape type and has an easy to use remote
the best machine in this price range .
i am pleased with the vcr , but it took about an hour to get it set up properly
plug &amp ; play didn not work
i finally ended up setting the channels and clock manually , and the initial configuration is relatively complicated
i am a little bit disappointed with the remote
one reason that i selected a jvc vcr is because i hoped it would interoperate well with my other jvc components , but the remote is awkward to use with my tv and dbs
overall though , it has a lot of nice features for the money , and the picture quality is good .
i got this jvc video tape player a long time ago and guess i paid about $100 for it back then
it is the only vcr we have now that still works and don not eat up vhs tapes
i got it because of the s/video and i can play are old vhs tapes with s/video to a dvd recorder s/video input to save are old vhs tapes to dvd
with the way are other vcr is are not working and messing up vhs tapes it is very good to get them saved to dvd and this is about the best way using s/video
-raymond day
i have no complaints
i love the picture quality
the picture quality is even further raised with features like video stablizer , video calibration , and you can change the sharp tone to "sharp" for a sharp picture , "soft" for a smooth picture , and "auto" for use with video calibration
this vcr is the most reliable i have ever seen
sometimes the picture quality is better that dvd recorders
unlike dvd recorders , there are certain tapes that can record hdtv
use that tape with its super video connection , and you will have a
when you hook up your antenna to the vcr , then from the vcr , to the t
, you get a super clear picture
( for antenna users ) it also has vcr plus , so you can connect it to your cable box and it will automatically record for you , a connection , , and an mts decoder .
pros : excellent value , great picture quality in , jog/shuttle , in/outs , easy setup , cables included , quality construction , lots of features , ok tracking , super vhs et mode , 400+ lines of resolution , has 19u heads for taping in the extended mode , can record super vhs on standard tapes , do i need to say more ? ! ? ! cons : tracking problems in ep mode , flimsy , some color problems , super vhs tapes may be hard to find and expensive , the menu system is kind of complicated , clunky remote , traditional programming procedure , front display panelthe bottom linethe hr3600u is a bargain &<HASHTAG> ; the picture quality , ability and features for $ are excellent
highly reccommended ! introductionmy reason for purchasing this vcr was simple
i wanted an inexpensive vcr with inputs
for those who may not know , inputs allow the transfer of <NUM> lines of resolution , as opposed to the usual <NUM> or so transmitted via rca connections
in theory , the higher the resolution is the better the picture looks
functionalityin addition to the vcr , there are a set of rca cables and an cable included as well
overall the unit is a piece of cake to setup
the unit has both rca and jacks on the back , and a set of rca jacks on the front
this makes it easy to hook up an external source ( such as a camcorder or something ) and record to vhs
i have my unit hooked up to my computer ( it has a video card with out and rca audio outs ) , and i haven&<HASHTAG> ; t actually used the input jacks on the front of the vcr
another feature i really like is the simple recording button on the unit
the way i have it set up , i can just reach up from my computer and hit it , and off it goes
this unit has a jog/shuttle wheel which is used to perform all the rewinds and fast forwards
i&<HASHTAG> ; ll have to say , this is my first experience with a shuttle wheel
i like it ! it just seems more cool than a &<HASHTAG> ; rewind&<HASHTAG> ; or &<HASHTAG> ; fast forward&<HASHTAG> ; button
lol the unit rewinds tapes faster than my old zenith vcr
the clock is easy to set as well
i think this is an area which has been greatly improved upon in recent years
for that matter , all the menu items are laid out in a common sense manner , which makes programming and such even easier
i noticed some were saying they didn&<HASHTAG> ; t like the remote control , but i think it is just fine
grant it , i don&<HASHTAG> ; t use it much , but the times i have used it , i haven&<HASHTAG> ; t encountered any problems with it
two other things i really like are ( 1 ) having a time code counter display on the lcd so you know how much you&<HASHTAG> ; ve recorded
( 2 ) when you rewind , this little bar pops up on screen and shows you where you are relative to the length of the tape
it&<HASHTAG> ; s not really super useful , but i just like knowing where i&<HASHTAG> ; m at
picture qualityi&<HASHTAG> ; ll have to say that for $ , this unit produces great quality dubs in regular vhs mode
i&<HASHTAG> ; ve been using it for several months now , and the video productions i&<HASHTAG> ; ve produced always come out looking very good
and that&<HASHTAG> ; s the most important thing ! i haven&<HASHTAG> ; t dubbed anything in or et mode yet because none of my projects have warranted that
i would imagine that the picture quality would be even more outstanding than the regular vhs mode though
nit pickswhile the outer enclosure looks nice , the unit &<HASHTAG> ; feels- cheap
i don&<HASHTAG> ; t think it would hold up too well under any kind of rough conditions
hopefully this vcr will reside either in your home theater or a setup like mine where it stays put and isn&<HASHTAG> ; t moved around too much
the cheesy &<HASHTAG> ; glow in the dark&<HASHTAG> ; keys on the keypad of the remote
i hate it when electronics manufacturer&<HASHTAG> ; s use these gimmicky things
they never work
conclusionsfor the money , you just can&<HASHTAG> ; t beat this vcr
the ease of setup and great picture quality are this vcr&<HASHTAG> ; s strongest points
i highly recommend this vcr to anyone looking for a budget level vcr .
esta camara la he comprado por que puedo grabar todas las fotos en discos flexibles , solo es cargar en el carro una caja de discos y tienes para cientos de fotos , una buena idea de la marca
me ha gustado mucho y la he disfrutado mucho .
this camera definitely works for what i need it for - taking pictures to use on my web site , the schumin web , and saving the remainder as stock photos
the floppy disk storage allows for you to take literally thousands of pictures without going back to your computer , and thus gets high marks for portability
all in all , a great camera , and if you are like me , whenever you take it with you , carry some floppies in your pocket , because you will be taking a lot of pictures .
the sony mavica was my first color digital camera
although i took a lot of pictures with it , i eventually bought another digital camera
the biggest problems with the mavica are
the resolution - <NUM> by <NUM> just isn not good enough
if you do any photo editing at all , the quality suffers because of the low resolution
you need at least a <NUM> by resolution , preferably more
the lcd is too hard to use , especially in strong light
you really need a viewfinder
the floppys just don not store enough
if you go on vacation , you need to carry a bunch of extra floppies in your pocket
on the plus side , the battery life and 10x zoom are great
but that just doesn not make up for the weaknesses mentioned above
do your self a favor and get camera with better resolution - and maybe you will only have to buy one
i traded up to a kodak dc260 and like it fine .
the mavica is a good low end camera
if i want to blow up my pictures to 16x20 , i use my 35mm slr
megapixel cameras do take better pictures but they require expensive memory cards
the camera takes great shots for web sites and email
if you shop around , floppies cost almost nothing
with a rebate , i bought <NUM> floppies
i put <NUM> of them in a bag and i took over <NUM> photos
( it would have cost me hundreds of dollars to save that many pictures on memory cards
) they used up less room than two rolls of film
the recharable battery lasts forever and i can go out and take hundreds of photos without having to dump the memory card
achiving the photos uses little disk space on my hard drive
the camera is very easy to use and in the long run pays for itself on the savings on film development , batteries or extra memory
i give copies of disks right on the spot and the camera is very reliable
if you are looking for a good &quot ; snapshot&quot ; camera , this is a good one
the other reviews mention the good and bad points of the camera so there is no need to mention them again
this is a great camera for real estate or onsite documentation and great for the <NUM> pictures of the baby or the family picnic
it is a fun , simple and easy to use camera
how many pictures do you wind up enlarging ? i run my favorites on my screensaver and they look great .
this is my introduction to the digital camera
so far , i am very pleased with the results
the mavica is programmed with five picture formats : fine , sepia , b&amp ; w , negative art , and solarize
it is easy to use , even for the beginner
i disagree with some of the reviewers regarding its size
i was able to shove it in my purse when i wasn not using it ; however , for the price , i would have liked to see it come with an extra battery and a carrying case
it does come with a shoulder strap , which isn not uncomfortable
the camera has zoom capability , but i found that you have to be careful with blurring
i don not fault the camera , but the photographer
i have had some experience with blurred pictures and
software such as photoshop will take care of that
i know because i have tried
the mavica works well with macs and pcs
the only problem i came across was sending the pictures after editing them with photoshop
if your mother doesn not have the same software that you do , then you will have to send that blurry or picture of junior
oh , well
i like this camera , but if i win the lottery someday , i will go out and buy a cd camera because of the memory constraints that these cameras have .
a wonderful camera for intrnet use
for auctions , emails , web sites , etc
this is a fine camera
the advantages are great macros ( down to 1&quot ; ) , 10x zoom lens , comes with rechagable battery and charger , simple downloading of floppies to your pc and the economy of using floppies as the storage medium
however this is not a camera suitable for photos ( because of the 640x480 resolution ) do not make the mistake of taking important shots and assume you can get decent photos
for fine photos go to a <NUM> or <NUM> megapixel cameras
i also own the nikon coolpix <NUM> camera and recommend any nikon or olympus camera
only the nikons have great macro capability ( if this is important ) a great buy for the money is the olympus 460/490 .
the convenience of floppy disks is hard to beat
no proprietary cables or special setup is required
even the newer cameras with the usb interface often require their own goofy photoschmuck software to be installed
the floppy drive enables us to share our pics at any time , even with friends that have older computers or ( god forbid ) a mac
almost any computer can read the jpeg used by the mavica cameras
you can even dupe a disk in the middle of nowhere
try that with a smart card ! if you want to make a living with artful photography look higher up the line , or at the olympus 600
if you want to make a living on ebay , or just have fun with your camera , it is hard to beat the mavica for convenience and versatility .
i have used this camera since the late 1990s for mostly professional purposes
i write and edit a newsletter for a state agency and am often asked to take photos at award programs and/or to accompany job announcements , often with almost no prior notice
of all the cameras i looked at in the 1990s , this was the one that best suited my needs
the reasons for that follow : 1
shooting photos on a diskette was easier than engaging software and changing documentation from the camera to a file on my pc
the 10x zoom is very accurate and allowed me to do adequate work even when i could not get close to my subject
the camera is flat out easy to use and has a large viewfinder , a large left hand grip , and big button to press when shooting pictures
before i bought this camera , i worked for three decades for newspapers and in communications offices of governmental and nonprofit agencies doing the same kind of work i do now
in all those years i never used a camera that was as easy to use as this one , nor did i use one where transmitting the product from the equipment to was easier
having said that , this is a low resolution camera that will not always give good results
it is adequate for head shots and has always come through for me in events
but i have taken photos of my cats at home where their eyes look more like diamonds than eyes , and i took some pictures of the christmas tree where the lights looked more like the stars or snowflakes than lights on a tree
so don not buy this to create photography
for all the same reasons , it doesn not produce very good hardcopy photos
but this is a great camera for someone that needs to take pictures right now and get an adequate product online fast
that is my mission at work and this camera has always helped me achieve it
in addition , the battery charger works fast and i have never had to pay a dime to get anything fixed in more than a of use
i don not know how this stacks up in the camera industry but it is a lot better than most of the electronic equipment i use in the office or at home .
simple , and easy to use for what it does , this is starting to look a bit overpriced nowadays
on the good side , you can use common floppy discs to save your pictures , the batteries last for ages and it is extremely easy to use , but on the other hand the resolution ( 640x480 in ) isn not good enough for anything more than simple holiday snaps
if you are prepared to do lots of you can use it as a useful image aquisition tool , and the lack of resolution can be a creative spur intself , but for anything more than simple images and casual snaps you'd be better off with a proper megapixel camera with some kind of memory storage .
this camera takes okay pictures and it is very easy to use
don not be repulsed by other reviewers who doesn not know how to use the camera , just go to your nearby retailer store and look at it yourself
it is in some ways due to the zoom and floppy drive ; a 10x zoom ( optical ) with a 640x480 is better than a 6x zoom ( 2x optical and 3x digital ) with 1280x960
i don not like it when people compare these kind of cameras to other kinds at the same or lower price using flash cards or smart media , because there are different essentiel accessories that aren not included in those prices ( the compact flash cards could make you say &quot ; aaaarrrrrggghhhh ! i don not have enough because i spent every penny on the camera ! &quot ; )
at the end , this camera still has problems with the quality of the pictures , but it comes cheaper than other cameras
if you have a lot of money to invest , don not buy this one , just buy the best camera with the best lens and don not look at lower priced items , because quality is what you want
last thing to say to whom never touched a digital camera , you must know how the camera works and how and when it take good or even excellent pictures
congratulations to those who bought mavicas ( me ! ) !
not being a computer or camera &quot ; pro&quot ; i needed something easy to use
i looked at the reviews for the product here at amazon
i decided to buy the f83 model
this model allows for a <NUM> second &quot ; movie&quot ;
boy do i like it
i like the ease of the floppy disk
the quality is fine for my needs
the battery lasts a long time
a camera bag is a necessity since the lcd screen marks easily
i recommend the camera to anyone wanting a digital camera that is easy to use
thanks amazon for providing the reviews , and thanks to those other individuals who made the reviews
i found them very helpful .
for entry level digital photography , you could do far worse than the mavica
what sold me initially , aside from the very reasonable price , was that it used floppy discs instead of internal storage
what this means is that if you have a pocket full of discs you can take pictures all day without ever having to download to your pc
it also means you don not have to worry about a free parallel , serial or usb port , which , if you are a peripheral junkie like me , is reason enough to give serious consideration to this camera
on the downside - yes , there is one - the resolution is not what you might hope for
when used at normal size , the pics are fine , not great
they are useable
when you try to increase the size to 5x7 or 8x10 , the results are disastrous
the other downside is that the flash will frequently wash out the entire picture , but the camera does not function well indoors with available light
you really have to fiddle with your settings to get this right
sometimes it is just not possible
so , do i recommend this camera ? yes , with reservations
if you are looking for high quality output and you have the bucks to spare , then look elsewhere
but if you want a decent camera for a reasonable price , particularly for outdoor use , check out the mavica .
this is great camera with many features
you can take the pictures in many conditions
the flashlight is good enough for indoor shooting
you can use the mode for automatic shooting &amp ; mode for manual shooting
you will have a great photos just using mode
just switch on the bottom &amp ; ready to take photos
if you want more professional photos use mode
you can adjust for the manual shutter speed or manual aperture
in this feature you customize your photos even you can bright your object at the poor light
the 2
11 mega pixels is good enough for viewing in the web , sending though &amp ; print in a4 paper
the worst think that i know is a battery live
this camera it is so hungry with power , that i thought same with the others digicam
for your convenient use a <NUM> set of nimh batteries , which can take <NUM> to <NUM> pictures each set in normal used
you can save your battery live with minimize using lcd monitor to framing the object .
i use this camera with a usb sans disk flashcard reader , which i find incredibly convenient
i email pictures to family regularly
the quality is matchless , but i have to ramp down the resolution and size or some files can be over <NUM> meg
the quality is so exquisite , that ( get this ) got a color matched fabric from a friend in ny based on a close up picture i took of a printed upholstery piece
i took a closeup of a diseased mahonia leaf , emailed it to my mom , and she diagnosed thrips and suggested bt
this is a camera with more capability than i need , but the picture quality and features are worth developing the patience to deal with the online manual and learn
i print pics on a hp722 and the prints look great
( tho the color degrades after a year
printer ink problem , not camera ) however , it has a few shortcomings
the paperless manual is a pain when you are learning
you just cannot see the lcd screen on the camera in bright light which makes using the manual settings impossible
the add on lenses ( wide angle , etc ) are awkward to use
i have lost more of the tiny lens caps than i will confess
i even dropped one on the grass and was unable to find it right after dropping it
i now have 6 , having asked everyone i know for one for presents .
i bought a nikon coolpix ( my first digital camera ) about a six months ago and am very satisfied with it
previously , i had owned a nikon <NUM> mm &quot ; &quot ; camera , but was interested in the advantages a digital camera would provide ; immediate gratification through seeing your pictures now , the ability to send jpg images to freinds and relatives , the ability to delete pictures &quot ; &quot ; , etc
what i got was a mixed bag of results - mostly positive
before i go any further , i must advise you to get the following options : two sets of rechargable nimh batteries which should be standard with the camera ( i use the kodak ones available at amazon
com ) , a memory card ( i use a <NUM> mb san disk - nikon is oem ) , and some sort of adapter to transfer your images quickly - the serial cable is just too slow
i have purchased a sandisk adapter and insert the memory card directly into the pcmcia slot on my laptop computer for rapid transfer
anyways , in use the camera is fantastic
initially , i was using the 640x480 resolution setting to save space , but with the new , larger card , i now use the 1600x1200 setting with moderate compression for all pictures
i find that the card can hold about <NUM> pictures at this resolution
once i find a picture i like , i use the microsoft photo editor software ( comes with office ) and reduce the resolution as appropriate ( web pages , etc
i store my &quot ; keepers&quot ; on cdrom at the higher resolution - you can always reduce resolution and size
the picture quality is great
the flash , however , should only be used up to 10' - any further and your pictures come out too dark
nikon usa has a web page with the latest firmware available for download - which i recommend
low points for the camera include the fact that the lens resets to full zoom every time you turn the camera off ! i find myself zooming out every time i turn the camera on - this eats up your batteries and takes time
the flap that covers the memory card does not always stay closed and flops open from time to time
sometimes , the camera takes a while to reset between pictures , so a bit of spontaneity is lost
there are now newer cameras out there
i find that the 2
1 megapixel capability of this camera meets my needs and that , given the recent price reductions , i would buy this nikon now if i were in the market today .
overall , this isn not a bad digital camera for most types of photography
it is quite easy to use , and perfect for the beginner
the only real gripes i have are the limitations in the size of the compact flash it uses , and the fact that after a time , the battery compartment won not stay closed
otherwise , i have taken some fantastic pictures with this camera ! in fact , i'd have to say it does better than some of the newer nikon coolpix cameras ( like the l18 , which i also have )
i have found newer models to have focus and flash issues , as well as severe shutter lag
this may not be comparable in resolution , but it is quite enough for most uses
you don not need more than 2
1 megapixel for decent resolution unless you are doing huge of photographs .
i also own a sony mavica and a kodak dc260 so this isn not my first digital camera
with the <NUM> i found that i needed to read the manual with care because much of the interface is restrictive and confusing if you try to just &quot ; go for it
&quot ; after blowing through several dozen test pics , i started to find the tricks to metering , autofocus and nikon is digital simulation of shutter and aperture settings found on a traditional camera
the quality of the pictures , once you get the hang of using the camera in a particular setting , is amazing
this is the highest digital quality i have experienced with a digital camera .
i love my nikon
it was a gift from a friend who is a professional photographer
she had outgrown it and was tired of me complaining that i saw this or that and wished at the time i had a better camera than my phone
if you have never used one of these before it will take a little getting used to
the camera pivots in half ( which is quite disconcerting and a bit confusing ) so you can change the angle of the viewing screen to the lens
the whole thing rotates freely <NUM> degrees , with settings at each 180 , so you can watch yourself "taking a picture of you" or use the viewing screen versus the manual viewfinder
the flash is a bit annoying , as it automatically fires in even remotely circumstances
a simple press of a button disables the flash , but then you have a longer exposure time ( about one full second ) which means that you have to keep your hands really , really still
just for fun , try taking a picture of the full moon and see how much you hand shakes
this camera is really at its best during the day
it should win an award for being the official picnic ( or even beach ) camera
it really is point and shoot , but it has an easy to learn and use zoom , auto/manual flash , and you can turn off the viewfinder with the push of a button if you are running low on battery
the live motion feed on the viewing screen is a bit jittery , but for the price that is nothing to sneeze at
my guesstimate is something like of video capture on the view screen while you are searching for that perfect moment to snap the picture
the short version : it is , easy to load and swap the memory card
it takes high resolution photos , and is so easy to use ( and durable ) that a <NUM> could handle it ( carefully )
stock up on extra aa batteries though
it eats through <NUM> of them in a few days of use
hope this helps
amazon is review still touts this as a &quot ; top of the line&quot ; camera when nikon released the third generation coolpix <NUM> months ago
the <NUM> fixes all the complaints people had with the <NUM> and the <NUM> ( shown here )
it also ups the resolution to 2k x1500 ( 3
34 megapixels )
it is a fantastic camera
that much said the <NUM> is more expensive , and if you don not need the extra resolution the <NUM> remains a great choice at a lower price
i just take exception to amazon presenting it as &quot ; top of the line
&quot ; the swiveling body on the 900 , 950 , and <NUM> allows you to hold the camera over your head with the lens looking down , or at your knees with the lens looking up , and still be able to see your composition on the lcd display , because the lcd is on the other half of the body from the lens
you just twist to see the lcd regardless of where the lens is pointing
other digital cameras don not do this and it is really useful
it is made possible by the fact that these cameras ( especially the 990 ) are so good at autofocus , autoexposure , and autowhite balance that for very many scenes you can use the lcd to compose and frame the shot , not worry about anything else , and get a great result .
having been a professional photographer for over <NUM> years i expected nikon to produce superior results
forget that the camera is difficult to use , the final quality of the pictures is poor
if you shoot only in sunlight or shadow it is ok , but mix them and the result is unacceptable
no latitude , or gamma , and even photoshop fails to correct the problems
maybe in the future , but until then , buy something to play with but use real film
i returned mine .
i paid $15
77 for this camera and it is great ! the one i got looked like it was hardly used at all ! it was out of the box but came with all accessories , the memory card , the case to protect it , lens cap , all user manuals
i got this camera to try to learn how to do infrared photography
i have to say , it is an amazing camera ! i wish i had this camera when it was released in 1999 ! i pretty much turned the camera on , and it worked amazingly ! i used the adapter i bought on amazon to fix a 52m filter on and i have actually obtained amazing pictures ! i am really enjoying infrared photography so far , and i am moving onto ultraviolet photography next
i am doing this all for fun and my own enjoyment
i didn not want to mod my nikon d3100
so this is the next best thing
for about <NUM> bucks i have this camera , the adapter , and the infrared filter
i have to say if you are looking to do some interesting things with your photography and are not willing to mod your high end camera , this is a great 2nd option
affordable also
= )
i have owned this camera for over <NUM> months now and i really like it
the image quality is stunning and i didn not find it all that hard to figure out how to use it
the controls are generally well thought out and positioned ergonomically
the camera is also slow ( i think this is true with most digital cameras
) you click the shutter and about <NUM> or <NUM> secs later it takes the picture
this may not sound like a big deal , but last night i was trying to take pictures of my infant son , and in that amount of time he often moved his face away from the camera
a significant short coming is the built in flash
its nowhere near powerful enough , even for a simple head and shoulders shot when the subject is <NUM> feet away
images often come out too dark
this wouldn not be so bad if there were accomodations for an external flash , but there doesn not seem to be one
also , the camera tends to create &quot ; red eye&quot ; a lot , which you can correct if you have photoshop , but that is more work than i want to do
the camera does eat up a lot of power , i agree with the others who suggest getting rechargeable batteries
you can get a set of nimh batteries and a charger for about $20 bucks ( it takes <NUM> aa batteries
) i'd suggest getting at least <NUM> aa batteries
i do suggest getting extra memory ( i have <NUM> megs ) and one of those usb memory card readers , its a lot faster than a serial port .
great camera once you learn the menus and buttons
advanced users of electronic cameras will find this easy
i have avoided the camera is because i like controlling all of the creative process
because of this , it took me a while to get used to the menus and buttons , but it was not hard
the coolpix <NUM> still allows you to control the creative process but i would recommend a good book on digital photography ( such as real world digital photography ) to get you started , especially if you are a film junkie such as myself
note : a memory card reader for your computer and bigger compactflash cards will make the camera much more enjoyable as well as rechargeable batteries
the first two replace your film and processing budget
one nice thing is that you can instantly reuse the memory card
mistakes can be erased immediately and the same memory space used for a better shot
a light steady tripod is also recommended as the camera has a &quot ; speed rating&quot ; of iso <NUM> and shutter speeds tend to be slow without flash
if you must use flash , get an external unit as the on board flash is too close to the lens and , as with all small cameras , produces flat featureless images
you will also need access to a good , fast color printer to print out the full reference manual
a copy center such as kinko is should work
this is not a camera for the &quot ; instamatic&quot ; crowd
hint : negative reviewers tend to be disappointed because it is not an instant hit , but with a little creative work , the camera does well
i may trade up to the coolpix <NUM> in a year or two after the price comes down .
this camera takes excellent quality digital pictures and comes with the nikonview software which enables you to make basic edits on the pictures on your computer
it is fairly easy to use and the compact flash uploads into the computer either via a reader or directly from the camera
i have seen some digital pictures which made me wonder why you would bother , the quality was so poor
this camera is the best i have seen and i would highly recommend it .
i just got the camera two days ago and have been tinkering with it ever since
the macro mode alone makes this camera a worthy investment
i do agree with others that the manual controls are a little tricky but i figure if you manage to get a good picture then you earned it
i have not been disappointed yet by the quality
picked up <NUM> rechargeable batteries and a <NUM> mb card and i haven not looked back since .
i just received this camera about a week ago
since then i havereplaced the 8mb memory card with a 96mb card
this camera definitelytakes some getting used to
i am taking mostly photo is of my new twinsand find that i am either afflicted with the palsy or the camera is super sensitive to shaking
suggest trying a tripod ( that is my next investment )
i think you also need to experiment with things like shutter speed to get the maximum picture out of the camera
i have had very mixed results with closeups but blame myself for not having gotten the hang of this yet
overall it is a really nice unit , solidly built
you will need a bigger memory card , probably a usb card reader and nimh batterys ( don not let them sell you nicads - get the 1500mah nimh along with a <NUM> hour rapid charger )
you won not be sorry with the camera !
works just fine
this is good labeling tape
i have been using thebrother labelerfor a while , and use the labels as visual aids on electrical/data cabling connection points and to categorize the contents inside plastic storage containers
you don not really have a choice about the tape you use in any label maker ; but this loads easily and stands up to the demands that come from occasional applications in demanding environments
select with confidence for your / labeler .
i bought this to help label the kids school supplies
it works great with my
i will continue to purchase in the future .
love this and the price of it was good as well
would definitely buy this for my labeler again
i use this item at work and its a good product that serves it purpose
i would recommend this item
the labeler that this fits is easy to use , has a nice selection of style of label , and the print is terrific
there is a good amount of tape in each dispenser , i think it is a must have for anyone that has quite a few things to label
the labels stick and stay well .
these were great ! easy to use , easy to replace , would definitely buy again ! these were shipped very quickly and arrived right on time .
great oem cartidge for the p touch
makes me file cabinet look professional and the cost is very reasonable
highly recommend this !
it works perfectly
what can i say other than that ? the inexpensive brother personal labeler ( navy blue/green ) that this goes with is awesome , so i pay the price for the refills gladly .
perfect for your label maker
high quality labels with a decent mount of ribbon length for the price
the only hard thing is getting the sticker off of the ribbon paper , would recommend the easy break off ones down the middle if you are willing to pay extra
overall though a great product for the price .
i expected this to work seemlesly and it did , so i do not have any complains
amazon had a great price compared to the local staples
, worked well for me .
i have used this product for twelve years , i still get impressed how long this tape lasts , and the ink never smudges .
i have <NUM> p touch label machines and find the machines and the labels work great
i use them at work and for home use .
this label cartridge is great
it prints white labels with black ink
i was out of stock and couldn not find them at cvs , walgreens , or even officemax
so i bought a few of them in bulk at amazon .
this replacement labeling tape is for a low end brother labeler
amazon had best price and shipped quickly .
used to label was a gift
as far as i know there are no complaints to the item shown above .
we bought one of these labelers
the first surprise came as we started to use it
as has been noted at length by another reviewer on this page , these labelers are designed to waste the tape
ok , we thought
then , when the tape ran out , we purchased more via amazon
wow , these refills are unreasonably expensive ! brother clearly has a "give away the razors and sell the blades" philosophy , seemingly making all of their money on the tape
but we bought it anyway , cause what else were we going to do ? we were stuck
we got the tape , inserted it correctly
but the cartridge was faulty and it unraveled on the second label
so we called brother and -- guess what -- the tapes have no warranty ! so , unless you are in the mood to give brother a *blank check* for your labeling needs , don not get into bed with them
they will leave you angry and wanting .
this tape works fine for my label printer
the adhesive holds pretty well
it is not very flexible once you have it stuck on - i would not advise using it for labeling cables unless you use the &<HASHTAG> ; flag&<HASHTAG> ; method
i have noticed that if you leave the labels on something for an extended period of time it leaves a white residue behind if/when you remove them .
label tape works as advertised on brother
just take the cover off of the back and insert cartridge
it works wonderfully but i think that it is pretty sad that i paid more for the tape than i did for the whole labeler
regardless , i am still very happy with the product .
works - prompt delivery - not issues - oem brother cart - works just fine in my label maker - not sure with whats up with amazon is posting filters - their trying to tell me my original review couldn not be posted ? - its a great product ! - like what gives ?
what can i say it is the perfect refill and gets the job done ! this comes highly recommended for your brother labeler
i have an old model but it works excellent
i have had it for many years and have never had a problem with it
glad to still be able to find tape cartridges .
i have a and works great - the tape i received is a genuine brother product
products like these keep you on top of your gtd implementation !
works great
make sure you have the correct size - there are at least <NUM> different size tapes ( m & tz ) and they are not interchangeable .
love this and the silver refills i see alot of reorders in the future !
brother has hit a home run with their labeling tape systems
i used to spin the old dynamo labeler to make labels but nomore .
i just purchased a few of these and it was disappointing that it was half the price of what i paid for the whole unit with a couple of these
overall , it works as described so i only docked it <NUM> star for the price .
i have had my labeler for years now , and i feel like i am always labeling something : files , leftovers , kids' stuff
but i only just now needed a new cartridge
so don not hold back ; label everything ! these labels are high quality
they stick until ( unless ) you remove them , then they come up without leaving any residue
you can even restick them ! and because they are thermally activated , the "ink" won not smear if it gets wet
i couldn not be more satisfied ( except the backing is so hard to get off
) .
official brother does the job right in the label maker
cheaper than all the local office stores
organization is priceless .
these cartriges are well build and the tape dispenses smoothly they are a littl ; e prices but it does a good job .
have a labeler ? have you run out of printing tape ? well , here you go -- just order this and you will be all set to label until you run out of things to label !
the product came in the factory sealed packaging
i have owned the brother for many years now and i love it
i am so much more organized
but this is about the tape
i use this tape on everything - file folders , plastic containers , metal , cardboard , everything except i don not think i have ever put it on wood
the most difficult thing is peeling the label from the backing
some days it is easy , some days not so much
the key is to gently rub the pad of your thumb over the edge of a corner of the tape
usually this separates the tape from the backing enough to peel it off
the tape sticks very well - i have even washed over the labels several times before it started to peel up on the corners - but it also peels off easily except from paper
it always seems a little expensive to me but one cartridge lasts forever .
not much to say about label tape other than it works great for my labeler
label tape is way overpriced , just like ink , so i recommend trying to waste as little as possible .
i use these labels and the associated brother label machine to tag plastic shoe boxes used to sort electronic and mechanical components
they stick perfectly and stay for a long time ( several years now and counting ) without peeling up at the corners
the print is high contrast and retains its color
all told , a great quality label .
fits in the machine perfectly - just drop it in the space and it automatically starts right up and you can continue whatever it was that you were working on - no muss no fuss
this is the refill for my touch labeler and while it may be slightly tricky to replace ; you really have to line it up properly ; it is ideal and functions just as expected for a refill .
this is the origional just like what came with the machine and it works the same too
you will like it .
this is just what you'd expect - a perfect fit replacement for a label maker
text comes out sharp and it doesn not jam .
m tape for brother
not much to say other than it loaded right into our home & hobby model labeler
prints fine .
it just works , it is really
i have no concerns about it and i would recommend it to a friend .
brother makes good labelers that works and sticks
this is a convenient model and is useful in everyday labeling
not too expensive and stays on the items you apply .
this tape is easy to install and easy to use
it comes off whatever you are adhering it to very nicely and without leaving a residue
i would recommend this product to anyone who needs to organize their life .
bought this to use for labeling binders and to label how much money remains on gift cards
the ribbon that prints seems to have been sitting on the warehouse shelf for too long
it partially prints each letter/number like some of the ribbon has gotten old and won not stick to the label
i would not recommend this product .
this spool of replacement tape shipped quickly , fit our brother perfectly and was priced at less than half of what the office store was selling for
the ink prints black on a white tape face
these economical replacements allow for labeling with reckless abandon .
i went to staples at first and found their price to be very high
since it is &<HASHTAG> ; retail packaged&<HASHTAG> ; the produce is the same everywhere so i saved buying here
* important note : this product also fits thebrother labeler ! ( the description only lists the newer model
) i love my and can not imagine life without it
i label rubbermaid totes , charging cables , a/v equipment , boxes , leftovers for the freezer , etc
and it always sticks to everything
and actually comes off cleanly as well
just make sure whatever you are labeling is dust/dirt free and you will be good to go .
i have used this brother m231 tape before , and it works fine
it is easy to load and work with .
i love my brother and this is the normal refill for it
it works just as well as the last one and even holds up in the fridge and the freezer .
i have bought this before
i get at least <NUM> years of label printing
i print things for my son at school and lots more .
it fits and works well , it is the original brother m tape 1/2&<HASHTAG> ;
no problems , works just fine , you will like it .
i have used these labels to do my filing
it is a lot neater and easier to read my files
it is the way to go .
the low rating is because the product description was not thorough enough for this old man
i blame brother & myself ( hindsight , i should have investigated the product more ) the descriptionsaid &<HASHTAG> ; brother m231 1/ black on white tape for labeler &<HASHTAG> ; i have a &<HASHTAG> ; &<HASHTAG> ; labeler &mistakenly thought the cartridges were for my , not knowing there must be other models of
i am a retired manufacturer & my old school thinking was to change model designation when models were notcompatible .
i like having two labelers - the larger brother which takes tz tape cartridges and the smaller brother which takes m tapes
i have found the lowest price for both tapes is on amazon
i keep a red on white tape in one and a black on white tape in the other .
we have an old brother p touch that has been working for years
the only difference between these and the ones you buy at a local retailer , is the price
much lower at amazon
we always make purchases that give us the free shipping , to add to the savings .
arrived in a timely manner , i believe it is oem , works as advertised
i would definitely recommend to any on looking to save money from the big box office stores .
the product arrived in a very short time
the price was very cheap
i am extremely satisfied
i would recommend this company to anyone
exact factory replacement for my labeler
amazon prime does a great job of saving me time and money as well as gas and wear and tear on my vehicle not to mention the frustration of dealing with traffic and not finding what in need at the stores : - )
i am not satisfied with the quality of this product , and i will not recommend this product to others
i have used the brother labels machines for years and found them to be reliable
the supplies are kind of pricey but that is typical for dedicated devices with a captive market
on this tape , though , i noticed that the 1/2&<HASHTAG> ; tape they have sold for years is now
47&<HASHTAG> ; talk about a chiseler is approach to giving the customer less .
was exactly what i needed for my label machine and at a fraction of the cost of what the local stores wanted .
does what its intended to , with no pain or suffering , depending on the host unit i imagine
recommended highly for whoever needs this particular model .
i ordered this tape for my father
he is had no complaints
it is a quality product for half the retail cost .
my very old hand tape printer is a relic and tapes hard to find
when you do locate one the cost is more than the device ; thus i let this purchase slide for a time until i needed to label something important .
works great and this is exactly as described
i like this particular type of tape because1 ) black on white and high contrast2 ) width is perfect for file cabinet folders , and handy for other stuff too3 ) i can cover up a previous label
clear labels you must peel off before putting a new one down .
i love my brother labeler
i label everything
every parts drawer and toolbox drawer
it is somehow rewarding and creates a sense of calm to create order in one is life .
needed more tape for the labeler we already had and the new one i just purchased
it always works well and we have never had any issues with them .
i use this for labeling boxes in my workshop
the labels stick and the printed stickers make things look a lot more organized .
pricey , but the print holds well , even outdoors in a new england winter
also the cement is durable
easy to use .
i love brother --they are the easiest to use
this standard tape is good and has lasted me a long time
will not stick on large plastic containers very well , but does fine on smaller containers for holding sugar , coffee , decaf , flour , etc
i wish brother would make it easier to remove the backing on this labels
it takes much longer than printing up and printing out the label itself .
great for labels and its easy and works well all kinds of sizes and dimensions
labels are nice very nice
found my , like , <NUM> year old label maker lying around one day
cleared out the batteries , put new ones in , was stoked that it even powered up
pressed &<HASHTAG> ; print&<HASHTAG> ; , realized that there was no more tape
ordered this , now it is back to life
i should go label the cat .
i have been using m cartridges for my for years to label anything and everything , including all of those pesky cords and chargers that seem to multiply around the house
we kept ending up with boxes of cords and cables that no one quite knew what they went to , and in many cases they went to devices that had been tossed long ago
by labeling cords when they come in the door , i can better keep track of them and eventually dispose of them without fear of reprisal
the adhesive lasts indefinitely ( i haven not had any come loose in the time i have been using the product ) and the cartridges dispense correctly every time .
i have used this tape for years and have an older brother labeler to prove it
using the tape on clean surfaces is a but its not intended to be used on items that have high usage , the printing will eventually wear off , but a new one is easily made up .
this fits the sample package that came with the label maker
well , the whole new label maker is like double this , so you pay for the labels .
i have been using the brother label printers for many years now , these are pretty good and of course you need tape for it to work , i am happy with this purchase .
i have been using this tape for my for years and it is great
one cartridge lasts me forever
i can label anything , including my children is ice packs and cups
they stay on in the freezer and in the dishwasher
the ink doesn not smudge , but after a few years of going through the dishwasher , the ink may fade
if i need to , i just peel off and make another one
as long as the surface is , it comes off when i need it to without any trouble without leaving any residue
what is not to like ?
the price on these was excellent
i had shopped around and of course the office supply stores that had them wanted an arm and a leg for one refill
my wife and i love organizing with these little labels .
yes , i enjoy labeling things - looks neater for labeling kid gear than a sharpie does
( of course , i do love name bubbles for the &<HASHTAG> ; serious&<HASHTAG> ; kid gear/clothes labeling tasks
i get frustrated when i am out of labels , and having more color options available through amazon is a good thing
having more label tape is good as my kids find the label printer and start printing random stuff .
i got my like <NUM> years ago for $9
99 from another website
trying to find the labels is hard and at office depot or office max or staples they are expensive
here , they are fair priced
of course i would have liked them for like $2
99 each but whatever .
it is a brother brand tape that i purchased for my brother p - touch labeler
looks , works , and sticks just like the tape that came with my labeler
and available at less cost than i could find in the local office stores .
this replacement tape was a perfect fit for my brother label machine
it was a lot less expensive then if i bought it in the store .
purchasing in quantity is a great way to buy the for brother labelers
i have been using a for years , and love it
practically indestructible
the one i have at my office has to be over <NUM> years old
just bought a new for home , and hope i get the same service from it
anyway , the brother replacement tapes have always been reliable , print well , and they are durable .
i use a fair amount of this tape
i tried using this outdoors
that was a mistake
it faded in about <NUM> days
i sort of knew that would happen
i need to spend the extra money to get the laminated version
as long as you only use it for indoor items it is just fine .
excellent product for about 1/2 as much as you would pay at your local office storebrother m231 1/ black on white tape for labeler
we use this label maker quite a bit
the refills are first rate
i have not tried the other colors , but the b/w work great
excellent label maker , & this tape works great in it , not much else to say , except it does the job & the labels work .
and i would also say that the sticky part has the perfect amount of tackiness
i'd be such a slob without my labelmaker .
i couldn not find this cheaper elsewhere , and the printing on these labels don not seem to fade , nor the stickiness seem to wear off
i only wish they made these with more label and less empty space in the cartridge so i don not have to refill my printer so often .
i love my labeler , and use it all the time
this is a much better price than local on the label refills , so i buy them here
works well with label printer and is easy enough to use
overall , i don not use the system frequently enough to comment .
the brother m231 1/ black on white tape for labeler is a very good purchase
i have been using brother products for years but i especially like this purchase because i can use it for creating files or placing it on the outside of the building for tenant apartments bells so fedex and ups can locate the tenant for deliveries
it is a great purchase and i highly recommend it .
black print on white backing tape
easy to install and prints great labels
no faulty letters , everything comes out printed properly .
it works as expected
i installed this black on white tape on a brother model
the labeler is not available anymore , so i was happy to see that the tape is still available
i am very happy .
the labeler makes it is easy to label anything
the quality of the labels are good and work in most situations .
works great for the brother personal labeler machine , white ( pt90 ) ! just like the original one that came with the labeler and great replacement
i always have my kids peel the back off the tape cause i run out of patience
otherwise it is fine .
this brother labeler is what i needed in a pinch for labeling frozen foods
small , lightweight and battery operated with a clear , concise operation interface .
i love my brother ptouch labeler and i purchased more to stock up
this labeler has worked well for us and i use it for everything at home .
this cartridge fits well and i have purchased it a few times already
it works well and has no problems
it is authentic and cost effective for our needs : labeling leftovers in the fridge so that we don not poison ourselves with <NUM> month old food that should have been thrown out last week .
i have been using the for over a year and just ran out of tape
the product works great for labeling files , wires , or anything else
i noticed some reviewers said the tape was hard to peel
the has a tape peeler feature ( just a little slot ) that gets the peel started and works like a champ .
i use the tape all the time & it works perfect
looks good & stays perfect
i use it to lable files , spice jars , movie titles on the plastic cases
book cases etc .
lovely , useful product
works as expected ! but
i would rather pay for a slightly larger labeling machine in order to get a much larger ( and longer ) tape cartridge
if brother were to increase the label tape length , it would only cost pennies to do so
is brother is profit important enough to damage the company is public reputation ? why not offer a more equitable cost/value ratio to customers ? if the company ( brother ) had given me the labelling machine free of charge , i would be more agreeable to their high prices of the consumables .
i ordered extra tape for the brother personal handheld labeler
knowing it would be used , the tape was backup for it .
this is an excellent product
i use my label maker for many different applications
this label maker tape still lasts me for several months .
i have had no problems with this brand
the price was right and the shipping was fast
i highly recommend prime with the <NUM> day shipping
i had mine the next day after ordering .
 labelers are handy little gadgets that should be in every household
there are all sorts of things that need labels
if you have a you will discover the hundreds of things that you never realized would be ever so much better with a label
this tape for the is the basic label tape that the machine needs to be useful
the tape makes high quality durable glossy labels and works perfectly in the machine .
the tape is good and works perfectly with my labeler
i used to label most of my family is things
it doesn not work very well with objects that need to wash with hot water or will go to microwave
the ink start to fade out .
i bought two of these with my brother label maker
i have no complaint , they work as described and overall good price
the writing quality is as expected and they lasts pretty long time for me
26ft is a lot of labels .
so far i have not had problems with any of these cartridges , i have not found a generic alternative to the company is expensive products , but when i do i will change
these things are just too expensive for what they are .
the real thing in a brother package for half the price of store bought
and free shipping
for those that don not know , this is "" tape
just fold it lengthwise to split the backing and pull it off
no more worrying the edge to get the backing loose
i work with small ( letters ) labels , so this really helps .
what i like about this labeling tape is the line running along the back of the backing paper
it makes it very easy to remove the label from the backing paper when you are ready to stick the label
i did have one bad experience with loading this labeling tape in the past
the tape jammed upon installation and i had to throw out a new tape
you can avoid this by being careful during tape installation .
i love my brother label maker and use it in our rental homes
this replacement tape is original brother ( though i have used knock offs and they work perfectly too )
i purchased this tape as it is manufactured by brother
i prefer to use replacements designed by the manufacturer of the product
this tape worked perfectly .
good quality product and looks good
one thing though : it has to feed blank tape so you can cut it , resulting in an inch of lost tape for every print .
i use this 1/2" tape on all types of surfaces , it sticks well and is easy to read .
there are nickle/dime items that are necessary , but only on occasion , in life
it is good to have a product and a reliable source when that occasion arises !
i use my for church name tags , labels in the file cabinet , shop labels , cable labels and more
this is a great product and i always keep a spare on hand .
i got my wife the brother labeler ( i think ) to use in organizing things ; primarily the <NUM> or so plastic tote bins we use to store things in the basement and garage
we have found through a few years of experience that the 1/2&<HASHTAG> ; is superior in longevity to the smaller width tapes for labeling these plastic bins -- little to know spontaneous that you get with a smaller width tape
i think it has something to do with the surface area to volume ratio for the adhesive and the slightly irregular and porous nature of the recycled plastic bins
in any case , we like this -- aside from the durability -- you can print large font so you can easily identify the contents from the label from a distance ( saves having to take everything out etc
i use this tape most often in the kitchen , to label and date spice jars and pantry items
the labels adhere well to glass and stainless steel , and do not peel off or yellow with time
i have also used the labels for a home filing system , and after many years , the labels still look crisp and bright .
these labeling tapes fits my brother label maker perfectly
also i found that amazon had the best price for these labels .
i use this for my brother and it works great
no complaints here
if need a refill , i will buy it here .
this is a good product
fresh , just like in the store , only cheaper
i have never had a problem with any cartridges i have bought from amazon .
just like i have purchased in office supply stores for years , but a great price
i have been using the tape for several days and works perfectly
recommend to anyone .
just what we were trying to find and couldnt locally
and the price was so much better than we ever paid before !
this labeling tape is perfect for manila folders or really anything you need to label
it is waterproof and does not come off easily
i use it labeling everything from manila folders to binders to toys !
genuine brother tapes are the only way to go ! clean and correct printing each time
i like this item
thanks !
we use this tape for labeling hanging file folders in our home office ; for labeling our tool chest ; to label jars of herbs , spices and other food items we buy in bulk ; etc
i even use this tape to label bottles of homemade vanilla extract for our use and to give friends as gifts
this is a versatile labeling tape for many uses
the split tape is now easier to remove from the backing , but , as another reviewer stated , due to static cling , the bits are sometimes difficult to throw away
still a five star product , though ! update nov 2012 : after we fell in love with theepson labelworks label maker ( c51cb70010 ) where the tapes were more reasonably pricedepson labelworks standard tape cartridge ( black on white ) ( ~1/2 inch , ~30 feet ) ( ) ( competition is good
now brother has the better pricing for tapes ! so lesson learned is keep an eye on both
or perhaps the answer is to buy one of each unit so you can always get the least expensive tapes ? ! ) and had a better selection such as theepson labelworks metallic lc tape cartridge ~3/ black on gold ( ) and the high visibilityepson labelworks fluorescent lc tape cartridge ~3/ black on yellow ( ) we have been hooked on our epson and it is tapes .
reasonable price ad it works all the time
this product never disappointed me for labeling folders and some asset lists i label them .
is very difficult to peel the label when finished
but for the price i guess is ok
if you can buy the original doit .
great product
very good text
backing is very easy to remove and stick labels on to stuff .
long time user of brother labeler & only beef is the price of the replacement cartridges
this was a good price , but kinda slow shipping
otherwise ok .
this tape is so nice
sticks on everything
i also really love my brother label maker
good price too , at the store this item alone was $17 ! thanks amazon .
i have a large collection of "historic family photos" which needed proper identification
i tried one of the "photos pens" from amazon but it leaked through the paper and ruined a photo
this is not only permanent but looks professional
the cost is secondary here to the functionality
ps - by adjusting the margin setting , printing on the middle font size , and using the return key to create a two line label , you can save valuable tape
using the "memory" function you can avoid typing common entries too many times
agreed the tape is expensive but it is a class act .
i have used several brother label makers , all of which use the tz series tapes
of those tapes , my two favorite are black on white in this width and the 3/8" width
i prefer the 1/2" width for hanging file folders because the label fits nicely on the tab
i like the 3/8" width ( ) for use with manila folders because the narrower width positions closer to the edge of the tab
there is also a 1/2" tape that is black on clear
however , the clear tapes also show any dirt or debris that might be trapped behind the tape
thus , if you are in an environment that has even a small amount of dirt or other contamination , it may be readily visible against a light background after the tape is positioned
one other caution regarding these tapes ; the backing can be difficult to remove
the newer tape cartridges have a split backing that is easier to remove than the original single piece backing
even so , a certain amount of manual dexterity is required to remove the backing
update : since the time i originally wrote this review , brother has modified the backing to be in two pieces , making the backing easier to remove
however , the individual backing pieces can be a pain to throw away because they like to stick to just about everything through static electricity
this tape adheres readily ; the print is nicely defined and has a high contrast
the tape can be slightly difficult to handle
overall , this tape is very useful in a variety of applications and one of my two favorite label maker tapes .
exact replacement of my original tape , works great for what i use it for
i recommend using this replacement tape .
the dealer had the lowest price : 1/5th of the local office supply store ! love these labels and use it for lots more than just labeling files ; there is a quote on my desk to remind me to breathe and focus
a tiny strip of plastic , changing a life in a tiny way
have my baseballs in plexicases with a clear brother label on each with name and info
this stuff is genius !
what a deal ! i received <NUM> cartridges of labeling tape with free shipping for less than the retail cost of <NUM> at a b&m store ! free shipping takes a bit longer but that was a choice i was willing to accept
product was exactly as what i would expect to receive at a retail store
i am delighted to get more for my dollar without having to sacrifice on quality
thanks ! will do business again
and again
and again !
great for labeling clothing by size and season ( e
, size <NUM> winter ) and toy bins ( dolls , puppets , cars , etc
) and freezer bags
haven not had a label come off yet ( i have been use the label make for about a year )
split backing makes taking the back off soo much easier
as for wasting the lead tape , i try to print several items together with one or two spaces between the items and then cut at the end--saves a little .
update : these tapes can get pricy
buying three or four tapes can add up to more than the cost of the printer
this is how i deal with it
order three or more online at amazon
remember , these labels help you organize your life and or business and or customers and i have come to believe the value of this outweighs the cost by a long shot
white on black is the best as i have tried black on clear but if the surface is dark then you can not read the label
i have used whit on black but the letters are not as clear - the advantage is it looks classier then the white labels
three years ago i purchased brother ptouch ( there is an update to this model which is even better ) for about $72
it is larger and heavier but you get much better results than the smaller brother which i bought around <NUM> and replaced the cutter a couple of years ago
the has usb and i recommend downloading the update drivers and free software from brother because it lets you get more out of the tape reviewed here because you can print <NUM> lines instead of <NUM> and any font installed on your computer as well as many types of boarders
you can even save the labels you make and open them later to reprint
once you go the usb route and see how nicely you can arrange your labels it is hard to go back to the little handheld units
review starts here : this is the classic black letters on white tape
the magic : the tape is separated from the backing in the label printer then the letters are burned with a thermal print head from the inside of the tape then it is stuck back down the backing and comes out of the machine
this is why the letters cannot be wiped off even with alcohol or other cleaners
black letters on white works on all surfaces
i have used black letters on clear backing which looks nice but requires the label be stuck on a light surface
if surface is dark it is hard to see the label
black on white is also the cheapest most common tape
brother is price is on the high side and i don not know of any generic aftermarket tapes
amazons price is about the best i have found and i trust amazon
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------tip : buy three tapes at a time so i don not run out and it makes the cost easier if you take your lumps in one shot ! if you buy the tapes one at a time you will be reluctant to use them when you need them
tip2 : ways i use brother tapes : on the ends of power cords ( like the type that comes with typical wireless router )
by labeling them it make it easy to relocate cords or pack up and move or if a power pack gets separated from what it belongs to it is easy to match up
car : i label the date and miles i last changed the air filter , fuel filter , or battery , etc
these labels will last for years in your engine compartment ! customers : sadly i used to label computers with a magic marker ! yuk ! labels look very professional
i also add notes such as "be sure to remove cable x before y" etc
my "p3 international p4460 kill a watt ez electricity usage monitor" that i bought on amazon this summer
i put a label on it that says something like push "up" <NUM> times to show watts ( which is the only function i use )
i also measured every electronic thing in my house and put a brother label on it that showed the power use when off/on and idle if that applies
i labeled my brother cx4800 computer printer with the info for the generic ink cartridges - amazon ! i will label a flashlight what bulb type and where to buy it
i label hard drives with the size , data i bought it etc so i can see that without removing it to read the label
if it is for a customer i record the date installed
there is a million uses for these labels and the make your life more organized and better ( the bible says god is not a god of chaos - amen ! )
i am so glad i switched to the brother label system ( specifically the pt9500pc label maker for the mac )
these cartridges are just a fantastic
not a single jam since we left dynmo !
the quality of the product was good i only wish i could order more than one but that is all that was allowed
the brother labeler is a great tool around the house
i use it to label my files , tools , kids items , and many other things
the black on white tape is perfect for any job .
it is only 1/2" wide , but you get great black letters on a sparkling white background
that slit down the rear--easy splitting backer means no more broken fingernails , no more using the family chisel to expose the adhesive
what cooler sound than the whirr of a brother <NUM> as your freshly minted label shoots out the side slot , ready to take on the world
file folders , basement shelves , neighborhood cats--231 organizes them all with finesse
you won not find a better tz label tape than tz231
stick it with pride !
these , and their corresponding brother label printer are a great thing to have
from the occasional labeler to the compulsive labeler and organizer , this is great to have
my wife likes to label spices and foodstuffs , i like to label electrical plugs and av equimpment wires
very nice to have .
this tape , when used in the brothers label maker is superb
the letters are easy to read
unlike other labels i have used , the backing is easy to peal off
i even labelled the breakers in my electrical panel
i am glad they have a qwerty keyboard and not an dial , makes typing labels a breeze
i recommend typing labels in batches , with a few spaces between each , then print the entire batch , and cut apart with sissors , that minimizes wasted tape .
well , it is tape , what more is there to say
the tz231 is black type on white background , 1/2&quot ; in size
this is perfect for labeling dvd cases , or optical discs .
it was good to find these labeling tapes at amazon
at a good price
they can be expensive in office supply stores
tape was in the original packaging and works fine
these brother labeling machines come in handy for lots of labeling projects and this one is nice because it prints on clear tape .
based on price and availability i bought this product
although never using one previously i felt that this was the right choice for me
it appears well made and easy to use
finish is good and does what it suppposed to
that was what i wanted
i would recommend to others .
i got my wife the p1200 labeler and these tapes to help her objective of organizing the entire house
these tapes work well , a few notes : - black on clear are ok , but black on white show up better
picking black on white will keep you from having to worry that the dark color of the item you are labeling will hide the type on the label -- for that reason , i favor black on white over black on clear
- certain items need a wider label to avoid curling and peeling off -- we found 1&<HASHTAG> ; work best on storage totes -- 1/2&<HASHTAG> ; just doesn not seem to have enough adhesive for the label to last over time
we use these 1/2&<HASHTAG> ; for labeling my daughter is lunch items etc
for daycare
it would be great if amazon basics had a replacement item that was a better value -- if you do alot of labeling , these brother products can get expensive .
after i printed a label , i had a hard time peeling the backing off
it came off in pieces ; leaving some behind .
very good tape
just like i have bought in the store for a higher price ! same good quality & cheaper price through amazon .
brother tz tapes are the most reliable and durable label tapes we have used
generic ones just don not cut it
1/ is our most used size
clear is great when you want to use it on colored folders .
this tape is great ! very crisp text and very easy to peel off backing and past on to "things"
i love my brother labelmaker and this tape is great
good value for the amount of tape
i am label happy and it takes me ages to use up .
black on white is the best
it is easier to read than white on black ( the letters don not come out as crisp esp when using small font sizes ) and black on clear
black on clear requires that the background is light or clear
i used to label an old power mac g4 cube computer and it looked great
other times i tried it on something that was dark and it was hard to read
the special backgrounds can add a more professional look that the universal all purpose white on black
brother labels are expensive but well worth the benefit which is a more organized home or work life
i have two brother printers : a portable and a desktop which is connected to my computer by usb model
you get free software from brother is website and you can save your labels .
the prices for brother is labeling tape on amazon have gone down significantly from when they where first available on amazon
now that they are much more competitively priced , i wouldn not get them anywhere else but here on amazon
- "crack and peel" tapebrother is "crack and peel" tape makes it very easy to remove the backing from the label to expose the adhesive surface
the backing for the label is split/ along its entire length of the tape
look ma , no fingerprints : you can easily crack and peel the top or bottom half or the tape , grab hold of the other half that has the backing still on it to position the tape in the desired location , paste and smooth out the half with the exposed adhesive surface , and finally remove the backing on the other half of the label and smooth out this half of the label
with this method of applying your label , you can avoid leaving any fingerprints on the adhesive side of your label
- tape for indoors and outdoorsbrother is labeling tape is designed to withstand weathering , so they are suitable for use indoors or outdoors
---brother labeling tapes are durable and affordable
the "crack and peel" feature alone makes it worthwhile to switch to the brother labeling system .
as described by seller
clear tape that when used in the printer has black letters on the clear background
works best on white or light colored surfaces .
this works well in our machine
we use several different sizes and try to be conservative because of the price , but we have not had any problem with the tape getting &<HASHTAG> ; old&<HASHTAG> ;
we use it inside , outside , in the heat and in the cold and on utensils that go in the dishwasher and it sticks without fail .
i have been using this tape with my labelmaker for years and have been very happy with it
i went to staples and ofcourse they were out of the black on clear so i went home and ordered on amazon
i should have done that the first time !
i bought the brother tape titler machine - very good
it is easier than avery labels , i ordered the tape brother tz131 , i thought it was black on white like the sample roll , it is black on clear
i didn not open it
i would really like to just swap the tape for black on white , but it is a problem dealing with internet exchange purchases , it seems such a hassle
i just put it one side
it sour one .
this is a nice tape with limited application
if you want to label a light colored , smooth surface with minimum change to the apperance of the item , this is the tape to use
it would , however , be very difficult to read the black print on a dark surface .
this is a good label
sticks well and stays on
only thing is its hard to peel the back of the tape
i used this to label my black glasses and items , works as expected and fits what it says it fits
this oem tape is just as expected and pricing was better than anything local
we have had nothing but great results with this tape and our brother labeler .
glibness aside , i have actually enjoyed this
it is great for doing small network jobs and keeping cables organized
the cartridge is a bit pricey , but worth it
sticks and stays stuck till you want it unstuck
pretty good arrangement .
this tape is great
it is <NUM> stars great
i have <NUM> colors of mk tape for my pt70 -1 ) mk231 black on white2 ) mk631 black on yellow3 ) mk232 red on whiteall <NUM> kinds are really good products
and i am glad i have all three
it is incredibly easy & quick to switch cartridges in the machine
just pull one out & stick the other one in
no threading tape through slots or rollers or anything like that
no loose ends of tape dangling out anywhere
no wasted tape whatsoever
it is really a very good simple design
this review is about the black on yellow 1/ tape
but i must comment here that the pt70 machine is really a nice little unit in every respect
this mk631 black on yellow label tape is very easy to read
label separates off the backing very easily too
tape sticks well but you can still remove it to reposition it
i am <PERCENT> happy with it
can not quite decide whether i like the black/white or the black/yellow the best
both are very easy to use , very easy to read
both very nice items
no doubt about it

i love my label maker
i have a home office as well as a shop filled with supplies for our events
there is something tacky about sharpies and duct tape
i have <NUM> different color labels ( this one being the green ) and so our <NUM> different setups each get a color
then on each label i can put my company info incase it is lost of misplaced
the label material it self is a heat transfer label
meaning if it gets hot it will become black
the green is more of a mint green , which is not an issue unless you are trying to make it match something
overall , the resulting label is very resilient to fading in the sun , being pealed off of most surfaces ( some plastics like rubbermaid they do not stick to ) and the size is very readable in both large and small fonts which my brother ptouch prints
now the down sides , which can be big for some people
i am 27 , and for a guy i have nails , which i need to get the backing off
there is no split down the center like a crack and peal , so you have to try at the corner for a bit
once you do a few you get a method down but it is still a pain if you need to label a ton of things
( my label maker has an auto cutter so if i have to make <NUM> of the same label i turn it off , print all <NUM> on one strip , peal the backing off of the whole thing then cut off the labels one by one with scissors ) the second issue is chemicals
i have tried to use them in the garage , but brake cleaner , degreaser and some oils will rub the ink right off
it is weird because it is a heat ink so it must be a layer on top of the label which i am wiping off , but either way i had a flashlight and i tried to clean the oil off of it one day and the label became blank
the sticker it self was awesome and stayed in place with no problem
over all a great little label product , <PERCENT> of the applications it works perfectly , and the adhesive becomes quite strong over time so they dont fall off in <NUM> weeks
if you are labeling automotive stuff or rubbermaid bins you will need another product .
my brother labeller is several years old now , and it is getting harder and harder to find the &<HASHTAG> ; m&<HASHTAG> ; series tapes in stores
i love my labeler , as it works well even in temperatures ( important for me ) , so it is great that i can find them on amazon for an extremely reasonable price , especially with free shipping with prime .
this is the color and refills i will always reorder it makes the disc look so professional when you mark a disc with it ! love it !
this color combo is one of my favorites ( the other being black on metallic blue )
i have used this type of tape printer for years and love it .
there is nothing especially important to say about this cartridge
they do their job flawlessly
i use it in my brother model personal handheld labeler with special time & date functionit works well , lasts long , and provides quality labels
and the price is much better on amazon
hope this helps you !
i hadn not realized that brother made a tape cartridge that features black on gold
it looks great for christmas labeling ! it also works for halloween .
i bought this silver tape when my original cartridge of white tape ran out
as others have mentioned here , it is really a gray more than silver
the standard white tape provides labels with a little more visibility and contrast , but this silver is better when you don not want the label to stand out quite so much - i used it to label some components in my a/v setup and like the more understated look
the black lettering is still very legible and the labels end up looking a tad more elegant on the gray
if high visibility is priority one , go with white tape
if you want more subtlety , pick the silver .
if you want to label something so that it stands out from the rest , this is it
these do fit the machine very well .
it fits my labeler
it does the color scheme as advertised
it is the right width
? it is sticky
what all can you say about tape ?
this cartridge is by far the best for all your printing needs
the inner tape is thick and clearly sticks to any paper material when the peel off seal is removed
brother has a nice line of cartridges in various colors so enjoy their products .
works great and sticks ok i use alittle glue on some stuff just to keep the corners from flipping up .
i have been using this method of labeling for quite some time now and i find that it is alot neater than wriring .
this severs its purpose
if you are like me then these things are just for you
good price for acceptable yellow label tape used in a brother ( )
will probably buy some more , maybe some red and blue versions next time .
if you are looking for a , inexepensive labling machine this is the answer
the price is right and it is very versatile .
best value anywhere online
suits my needs perfectly
quality product and excellent price
hard to beat that combination anywhere else ( online or retail ) .
when i used this on nametags , it wasn not quite clear ; it was kind of frosty looking
don not know why unless it was made for brother and not by them .
i ordered different widths and colors to mark videotapes for processing
some videotapes will be processed at a commercial facility ; some i will process myself
this was i can use color codes to identify which is which .
it is what it is
it works but when removing the tape months later , it seems to leave residues
i had no problems other wise .
i use this to label my jellies and perserves for
i use it to label all my homemade , homebaked goods at christmas time
excellent , , and easily dresses up a boring jar with the metallic gold tape .
works great on my label maker .
works as advertised
i try to be organized & having a labler that is quick & easy to use helps .
label things ! label all the things ! i like having the colors to coordinate with whatever is being labeled -- battery packs , food canisters , pets , and small children
so buy this , assuming you have a compatible brother label printer , and embark on a rainbow of happiness .
i love the transparency of this tape and it sticks to a jar or cabinet really well
fun to use .
i use to but this black on clear labeling tape and the old stuff was better for me
the clear part was really clear - now it is sort of a matte clear but it is ok for most things you put it on .
this tape is a dull matte silver with black lettering - perfect for my application
do not expect shiny silver .
the clear tape is great as a way to replace engraving
it does have a gloss like scotch tape and is not quite invisible .
i am replacing a cartridge for my label maker and this is the right color and size , with a reasonable price .
i thought &<HASHTAG> ; non - laminated&<HASHTAG> ; mean dull surface
it is pretty high gloss
silver has slight pearl color shift to it
very nice !
bought this to go with my old ( about <NUM> years ) brother labeler
this one is black print on yellow tape to stand out against any color surface
used it so far to label the drawers on my large rolling tool cabinet ; easier than having to open numerous drawers while searching for tools
fits and works perfectly
nice to know i can still get these cartridges at a good price for this old printer .
this works perfectly in the brother
the color is eye catching and the labels stick very well
now i want to try the clear .
i bought the and wanted some label refills that were black on clear
this was perfect for me
not much to say , but it is what is advertised .
it is the real deal
what else can i say
well , they want me to say more
black on clear is more discrete and less showy
but then again , black on white is easier to read .
i like labeling things
boxes so i know what is in them , devices so i know what they are specifically for , warnings etc
the great thing about this item is that there is no white strip to show what is there
the clear background works very nicely against the objects own color ( s ) making the words look like part of the original .
i use my printer a lot , and this tape ( brother m131 black on clear 0
47in x 26
2ft ) was priced right .
i use this on my motorcycle to listen in on the road captain is conversations while tripping down the road with the hogs
it works very well , especially as a simple monitor , and the &<HASHTAG> ; channel switching - swapping&<HASHTAG> ; is handy since they change from <NUM> to <NUM> and don not tell anyone
compact - nice package .
the radio is made of great quality , but like others have wrote the range when it is in carry mode is very bad
so if your thinking about using this as a bug out item don not
to use this for a bug out scenario wouldn not work unless the person you are talking to is standing right next to you
in car mode with a antenna it is cool as heck
it has all the bells and whistles in place back light , weather , rechargeable battery pack with power cord , and more
good job midland
flexibility comes at a cost in performance and this is no exception
good product , put together nicely and has tons of features
minor annoyances : the clip behind the radio is not the best feature , the lcd light does not stay on long enough , and the speaker volume should be louder
lots of upsides ( well covered in other reviews ) with some minor but annoying downsides .
needed a cb for a jeep jamboree and will likely only need it once or twice a year
perfect for this radio
price is right , easy install , good for a jeep where there is <NUM> room for full size perm cb
did a perm antenna install , ran the coax just to the right of the console , keep the cb in the center console and pull it out when i need it
can not speak for the portable performance but as an cb , it is perfect for occasional use .
i use this in the car when driving long distances through major metropolitan areas - listen to the truckers discuss road conditions
i can hear pretty good with this
talk power may be limited - even though i have got a good roof k40 antenna with a good sws
acess to squelch and volume is is a little trickly while driving
i wish this unit had adaptive squelch so that i don not need to constantly fiddle with it .
this is the best cb range is <NUM> to <NUM> miles using a wilson wi willie external magnetic atenna
cb is crystal clear transmitting and receiving
very well made and love the fact that it can be powered by the cigarette adapter included
i use this cb with my miata club and nobody has a problem keeping in touch with this cb
love the fact it has the weather channels and that you can lock in your settings
i highly recommend this cb .
i had a cheaper , midland for a few years until it gave out
bought this one as a replacement for my car , and it has been worth the extra money
it has a lot of nice features on it that you would find in higher end cbs for a lot more
but , what i like best about it besides the features and portability is it is size and
it fits nicely in the cup tray or cd stack in my car
and , the knobs to adjust the squelch and volume are easy to feel and turn without looking at it ( so that i can keep my eyes on the road )
it fits well in the hand and is easy to use
the sound comes in clear , and others tell me that i am coming through clear
the speaker isn not the loudest and pretty directional , so you will have to move it and face it towards you when trying to hear sometimes
otherwise , a great little cb .
this little radio is feature rich the features just require you to be a half mile or less to the other radios
using the adapter to plug into my trucks antenna i didn not get that more range at the most maybe bumped the range up to a mile and that is it
this radio would be good for a vehicle that didn not have a cb permanent mounted or even a rental when going on vacations to get road reports from semis and to listen to the weather chanel on it
would also be good to have to and talk between two cars on a trip .
midland make a nice portable unit and it has some nice features for its price
this unit comes with <NUM> battery packs
one is for standard cells and one is for rechargeable cells
it also has a 12v adapter that takes place of the battery adapter and gives you the option to connect a larger antenna which is great if its taken form vehicle to walking
it is built well and it works flawlessly
if your looking for a good combo unit as a backup or as a main unti this is a great little system .
i shopped all around and read hundreds of reviews of hand held cb s
i used to travel aback and forth from tempe az to chicago when i was in college
i used a mounted , cb for eight years and i relied heavily on it to keep me awake and interested during the <NUM> hour trip
so , nostalgia set in before xmas and i bought this unit
and a second one for my son who commutes to college
the reviews are correct on the short range of the wand antenna on the unit
not good
i bought a lil wilson magnet antenna
on the highway today , my radio checks indicated i was getting a transmission range of miles
not bad at all
brought me back to the college commute
i recommend this device for any of us aging baby boomers ( and their kids ) and i should add that the noaa weather channel is great
cb radios saved my life a couple of times
i am back in !
nice compact little radio that fits on most motorcycles
ride in a club where many members have these
one of the only suitable cb for a bike that doesn not come with an oem cb
range will depend on antenna
rubber unit that attaches to the radio and is part of the package is good for short distances
would guess 1/4 mile or so depending on the terrain and conditions
weather band is a nice feature as is the cigarette lighter external antenna connector
also comes with two battery packs and a charger for the pack that uses <NUM> aa rechargeable batteries
i am currently trying eneloop batteries in the unit
the other battery pack holds <NUM> regular aa batteries
both battery packs as well as the cigarette adaptor slide on and off easily so you have plenty of options
i don not see why <NUM> rechargeable batteries couldn not be used i the <NUM> battery holder
you would just have to charge them in the other pack or a regular charger .
i bought this because of the duality of it is nature
it can be used as a walkie talkie , with either <NUM> regular aa batteries or <NUM> rechargeable batteries which can be charged while in the radio ! or you can plug it into your vehicle power point and use it with
just about any kind of cb antenna you may choose
just make sure you check the swr or have someone do it for you if can not do it yourself ! good sound quality , both as a cb and as a weather radio
and , when i got it , from the 'used' department at amazon ( bad idea ) , it was a couple of weeks before i was able to try the arechargeable base' to see if it worked
everything else did , but this item did not
having hassled with amazon is chat function a couple times , i wasn not in the mood to deal with them again , so , a quick email to midland got me a replacement rechargeable battery box that did work , no charge , no hassle , <NUM> days in the mail and i am very impressed with midlands customer service
thanks veronica !
convenient size , great adapter arrangement for use as a mobile cb
both reception and transmission are very clear
reception from a distant source can be hard to hear on the speaker
i haven not tried a headset yet , but i think that would help
range with an external antenna is good -- several miles with no problem
display is good , but i wish the display had a backlight instead of lights off to the sides and i wish there was a way to keep the lights on when plugged into the car adapter
lit keys for night use would be nice , too
solid construction
the one i received was flawless
the removable antenna is really convenient
i added a 27" collapsible to replace the rubber ducky that it comes with to extend the range when using it as a handheld .
if you are in the market for a portable cb option - please do yourself a favor and seriously consider the midland
what makes this portable cb option great is that it is a reliable source for inside your vehicle - and you can just as quickly switch out of it and start using it outside of your vehicle
which is great when you are traveling on a jeep run or similar activity
does it work as well as permanently installed cb ? maybe not - but this one has worked great for me .
i got this for camping in the boonies
i got the antenna to increase the range
it works well
good for weather reports in the area .
i use this compact cb while traveling and it work just fine , it is small and with the cigarette plug option , i don not have to worry about batteries .
i used this radio on <NUM> mile <NUM> day trip on my harley and worked good the whole time , keep in mind though it only has a <NUM> watt output so range is lacking compaired to the other bikes i was with .
glad i didn not need this sooner
the radio moved on the super saver shipping timeline even with mandatory $10 standard shipping
i could have walked to ky for in the time standard shipping took
the vehicle mount antenna ordered same day , standard shipping , from cricket ventures , amz reseller , arrived four days before the radio
on the other hand , the radio and antenna are superb ! an exceptional package of capabilities , size , and features
midland would do well to copy this product architecture across their other families of ht/mobile products : gmrs/murs , business band
buy the radio
just don not expect timely delivery .
i got this and the cobra antenna
this thing does not pick up hardly anything i am not sure its even working
i can pick up the weather radio but everything else seems to be crap
i am sending this back not happy
it is a good idea but it don not work
excellent value
works great , easy to learn/operate
i have not used a cb radio in years , so was impressed by the scan feature
<NUM> ways to power it , and auto adapter comes with external antenna connector , no need to buy adapter
control buttons located handily , easy to navigate
can recommend .
a nice little small radio that works well and and it took minimal effort to hook it up in our vehicle .
product is solid
the /portable battery clip on is great along with the ability to plug into an antenna like a lil wil
reception is not great , a couple miles , but typical unless you plug into an antenna , again typical
full scan and 9/19 scan is a solid feature
nothing amazing about it , nothing bad about it
great back up when cell service is not available .
i didn not want to mess up my dash or drill holes for mounts
this product fit the bill perfectly ! the volume knob was cracked , and i wasn not going to send it back for that so i purchased some 6mm knobs , and trimmed the base ring off of them , and they look even better than the originals
see : b008dfa0y0the best part about this unit is the battery packs , one for normal aa , and one for rechargeable nicad , and a charger too
this allows you to go portable and mobile
the wiring set up for in the vehicle works great , and allows you to put the handset between the driver seat and console , and remove it if you don not want to leave it in the vehicle
the fact that i can use it out of the vehicle too , is what made me buy this one vice the similar cobra product
so far it works great , and i have gotten pretty good range mated up to a tuned firestik antennae
having weather bands as well is a plus
great for 4x4 folks in the field .
i am not a serious cb user ( i use ham and gmrs , mostly ) but this is pretty handy to stick in the pickup when i am pulling the travel trailer for a road trip or camping
range was about what you'd expect ( without skip about the best you can get on cb is around 4- <NUM> miles with a decent antenna ) with a <NUM> ft
don not be too disappointed with radio activity- cb isn not what it used to be , what you will mostly get is truck drivers if you are on the freeway , and just about nothing anyplace else , although i did pick up a couple of drug dealers conversing in spanish a few days ago
recommended if your intention is to have it around in your vehicle for road info .
don not get me wrong as a handheld as long as your not close to any rfi source , it is ok
but in my car
a <NUM> cobalt
its worthlessi spent extra money on a magnetic antenna , tried chokes and even bought a noise clipper , nothing made a difference
then i tried the cheapest uniden handheld cb radio that i had under the same circumstances with the same equipment
and guess what no noise
so my advice
buy a uniden radio
the bad news is these things had their hay day in the 70 is i purchased the one above and im happy with it
there is literally nobody on them anymore ! maybe some people near a major interstate but thats it
great if your on an interstate all the time but other than that not so much
but a really nice radio !
while i have ham/cb equipment in my cars/car--i really like to have in my most recent car nothing 'installed' and permanent ( for now ) thanks for a great product !
i use it with my mobile unit to keep in contact with the others when we go in the mountains to go rock hounding use mobile for the base unit
i have purchased two of these radios and they work great ! when we go camping the wife uses one to communicate with me when we are backing up our fifth wheel camper .
if this radio was stolen in would instantly buy another one
this unit has the best of both worlds ! the cb comes with <NUM> battery packs , one of which is setup for rechargeable batteries
it also has the mobile adaptor which allows for the unit to be wired into the car for full power and antenna capability
the battery life is really good
i can go all day and have plenty of power to keep going
i have a firestick on the back of the jeep and this really helps out when surrounded by hills
the handheld is great if you want to step out of the vehicle and still be able to stay connected
swapping back and forth between the mobile adaptor and the battery pack takes all of <NUM> seconds
it is simple to swap back and forth multiple times a day
( especially if someone in your off road group continually gets stuck ) the additional weather band has been convenient to have on a few occasions
i have not had any issues whatsoever with range with the short antenna
the longest distance i have tested was about a 1/4 mile on an expressway , but the reception was clear as day
i only use the cb when i am with a group and we typically stay within close proximity of each other
the firestick drastically changes/increases the range , of course
so if you are like me and use your radio for recreational use and want it permanently mounted in your car , then this is absolutely the perfect radio for you ! buy a firestick with the quick disconnect and you can basically have the entire setup up and running in less than <NUM> minutes .
the only reason i did not give <NUM> stars was the lack of ssb on this unit
otherwise is is exactly what i have been looking for
newer trucks don ; t have all the extra room to mount toys like the older trucks did so this fits right on in .
i use this with my lil' will on my bmw 325is mainly to talk with truckers about speed traps on longer trips , the unit has very good circuitry for how small it is , and it leaves basically nothing to be desired except i wish there was an option to leave the screen backlighting on
great little unit !
used it for a couple of months and decided to switch to a vhf radio
reach is minimal , even two cars driving next to each other doesn not allow for good communication
go for a talkabout if you look for something simple or a vhf if you want long distance good quality communication .
before a recent group outing , a cb was on my short list
after reading plenty of reviews i kept finding myself turning back to this
finally pulled the trigger and ordered one - even picking up a ~$10 savings on a repackaged one from amazon is warehouse deals
i have had such success with the aa battery base attached that i haven not even been deeply tempted to permanently install the unit with a fixed antenna
here is my take on it after a half dozen trips
pros - comes with everything needed to be functional , short of batteries and a fixed mount antenna
- adequate range on alkaline battery power and stubby antenna
- more than adequate battery life
i did <NUM> trips before i was tempted - not forced - to change batteries
- startling clarity
a fellow <NUM> wheeler asked me what unit i was using , that he wanted to buy one for a backup / handheldcons - might be a minor point - or a technical nightmare - but it'd be mad handy if the unit could be used with 12v power andthe whip antenna
in short - there is not much more to be added to the fine reviews and the strong performance of this unit
for value , clarity , power , versatility and installation flexibility , i can not see this unit getting beat
update : relative to the "con" noted above
i emailed midland support to ask about the 12v / whip antenna issue , and to ask about a replacement volume knob
they very quickly and graciously responded that it is indeed possible to use the unit on 12v power with the included antenna
here is their clarification : "when you slide the mobile adapter on the bottom of the radio it disconnects the rubber duck antenna on the top of the radio
to avoid that from happening you canplace a small piece of tape on the bottom of the radio over the small squared contact right next to the <NUM> screws on the bottom of the radio before you slide on the mobile adapter
"a replacement knob was sent as well
i tried out the unit with the <NUM> aa rechargeable base
worked great for the trip , staying on a total of <NUM> hours in scan mode while i ran the batteries out
( eneloop rechargeables )
great design for use in any vehicle since it offers flexibility in mounting and connecting options and additionally allows for it to be used as a portable , ie
nice portable cb ! full <NUM> watt power and weather channels
has a extra battery pack and i never thought i'd use the phrase : "batteries not included"
you can plug it into the car 12vdc socket and use it with an external antenna , again not included
ez mile range with a decent antenna
about <NUM> mile range with the little antenna that comes with it
worth the price !
i am neither thrilled nor disappointed with this purchase
for the price , it seems to work well
plug it in , press the button , and talk
people sometimes talk back
it works .
i should have listened to everyone else reviewing this product
handhelds , including this one , are pretty useless without an external antenna
perhaps it was defective , but this one wouldn not even pick up a broadcast 50' in front of my truck
nonetheless , this would be a great value if it worked
it includes a cigarette lighter adapter and two battery compartments .
this cb is nice money well spent i
will love using this unit it come with all you need to start with .
used it on motorcycle while on a <NUM> mile trip
bought the <NUM> headset , broke off the headband , and inserted the speaker in helmet
mic worked well until we hit ts andrea and it got too wet to understand
will be using in car too
i returned this item , i found an older production year so i could do the channel mods i wanted , i love the radio , the fact that it can be both a mobile and hand held has corba beat hands down .
nice small unit
the range isn not that great but it picks up the weather stations
fits right in the glove box .
nice unit , has weather band too
good range for small unit
use on bikes to chat to other riders .
it is a nice little unit to test out my motorcycle cb
it has all the right accesseries & performed as expected
not so good in high traffic areas .
i am overall pleased with the midland radio
out of the box i was picking up a few transmissions with the rubber ducky antenna , mostly truckers from the highway about a
5 miles away , and even some powerhouse channels from across the country
using these as mobile units you could probably transmit to maybe 1//2 mile between two identical units with the rubber duckies which isn not bad when you are out in the field with a buddy
once i had this setup in my jeep however i was easily receiving transmissions from miles away
i have this setup with all firestik equipment : firestik ii antennafirestik stud mountfirestik 18' coaxi am also using a rugged ridge jeep mount
the total setup yielded 1
0 - 1
2 swr - pretty darn good on a jeep
a few notes about using this in your vehicle
it is convenient when you don not want to mount a full size unit within the cab of the vehicle
it is so small that i can store it in my center console or the glove box - which is nice for jeep owners since you can easily store it away to prevent theft
this unit has all of the functions of a full size cb within a tiny package the size of about a normal cb mic
the sound is very clear and the transmissions come off clear from what i have been told
the only thing i really didn not like about this cb is that the product description says full led back light , however the back light only stays on for <NUM> seconds , even when powered via the car adapter
i figured that it would only turn off after a few seconds with the battery pack installed , which makes sense , but there is no reason the light can not stay on when you are in the vehicle
it is also only lit by <NUM> leds - one from each side of the display - not technically full back lighting , but clear enough to read the display from a few feet away
the only issue is when you want to continually toggle channels etc
at night , you have got to keep hitting the light button first
also , which would be really nice , is to have lighting behind the buttons , sort of like a mobile phone
there is no lighting behind the buttons so you have got to remember where each button is and what they do for night driving
overall this is a <NUM> out of 5 .
this radio is just great
i purchased this product from amazon when midland first came out with this radio
back in <NUM> or 10
have not had a single issue with the radio
it works great , has wonderful shortcut buttons , and in my own thought , much better than the version that cobra has
only downside is that the back light does not stay on
but from there on , its great .
the radio works as advertised and i enjoy it very much
the main reason i ordered it was because you can use it as a portable radio and as an cb
with the external whip antenna it works excellent in the truck
it also is a good price
if you read the specs and know what you are ordering , then you will not be sorry .
it is a nice looking rig and it worked ok with a folding ht antenna affixed to the top
i could barely get <NUM> miles range no matter what i did or how i configured it
i used it on battery with a collapsable antenna and i used it in the car with an external antenna
both configurations produced a barely audible transmission at two miles ( verified during a test with a regular mobile cb on the other end )
as i was tightening the external antenna connection to the radio is jack , the radio is jack twisted inside of its sheathing and broke the wire to the jack
this was because the threads on the radio jack were so poorly made that the mobile antenna wouldn not screw on more than 1/2 turn
this is very poor workmanship and should never have passed out of qc
i sent it back for a refund
spend another $35 to get a name brand cb that is adjustable and tunable and you will be much happier .
nice radio that does everything i need it to do
coupled with a jeep mounted 4ft firestik , the range is better than expected
would highly recommend this cb .
i took this little unit on my bmw motorcycle for a <NUM> mile spin
worked the whole time , even when we were getting rained on
it didn not really say anything about being water proof , but did ok in light rain
buttons were a little small for my gloves , but i don not think this unit was design with motorcycles in mind .
this cb radio is the most awesome cb i have ever owned ! and i'v owned a lot of them since the 1970s ! this is so easy to go from totally hand held to a mobile cb and the sound quality is better than my big radio ! just be sure you match it with your antenna when using it as mobile ! as with all cb radios this is a must do ! there are good swr meters on amazon ( or elsewhere if you prefer ) like just about any truck stop or radioshack
i would definitely recommend this radio to anyone who is looking for a new and very versatile cb radio ! happy cbing ! update : if using in a big rig you may want to use an external speaker with it
i could still hear but found myself straining a bit
it takes all of about <NUM> seconds to plug in a ext
speaker and well worth it
i also use a retractable mic
keeper ( hooked to belt clip ) to quickly install in truck .
cb radios were very popular in the 70s
<NUM> in <NUM> cars had one ! in the mid 90s there was some what of a come back that may have lasted for a couple of years
in <NUM> there really are not that many cb radios out there
this is the reason i think some of the reviewers think their radio doesn not work , there is just nothing for them to pick up ! this being said , cb radio is still alive and used
truckers use them so you can always find out what the traffic is like , or where a speed trap is , and there are still people out there with base stations and mobile cbs providing for interesting conversation
just not as many as <NUM> yrs ago
having base stations , mobiles , and handhelds in the past i decided to the cb world with this midland
it came nicely packaged with everything that is advertised
first i put batteries in it and listened in the house
heard truckers on <NUM> plus found that on <NUM> there is a whole group of locals that talk on their radios nightly
this was just using the included antenna
next i hooked it up to an old firestik iba5 indoor cb base antenna i had stored away , and i was picking up enough transmissions for the radio to be entertaining ! next day i drove around with the radio in my f150 with the stock antenna and batteries
not a single thing to be heard
last night i put a magnet mount midland mobile cb antenna on top of my truck , and used the unique cable accessory that came with the radio
you snap it on to the bottom of the radio where the battery pack goes , and you plug one connector into the cigarette lighter and the other to your antenna cable
the radio pack and this device slide off very easily and slide back on securely , so you can attach it to the radio or take it off in a few seconds
i ran the cable from the antenna through the door
closing the door on it was just fine with no damage to the cable
now for the big test ! i drove <NUM> miles to work this morning during a major snow storm ! the radio worked like a charm
i was picking up all the truckers ( a lot of them ) and getting reports of conditions around the whole area ! the rechargable battery pack allows you to run the radio home off of your ac current , or if you prefer use the regular battery pack for normal batteries , or use the car device with your cigarette lighter
there are also jacks for a speaker and mike
so essentially you can use this radio as a base station , a mobile radio , or as a handheld ! small enough to just slip in your pocket
also the sound , although not really loud , is vey clear and easy to understand
radio also picks up the weather bands
i am very happy with it
i haven not transmitted to anybody yet , but i can tell transmit works well by testing it with an old handheld i had
distance would be measured by the type of antenna i use and how i tune it
once i make a few contacts i will get back here and let you know how far i got
i buy radios for fun and in the week i have had this i have had a lot of fun with it , and would recommend it if you want to have some fun with cb radio
update : yesterday i was in a higher area ( in my pick up using the midland antenna ) talking to a base station <NUM> miles away ! he said the radio sounded good ! so after using it for a few weeks now , i am very satisfied and really glad i bought it !
purchased this radio as a hold over until i mounted my other radio in the truck
worked fine
speaker is kinda small so hard to hear at times with the windows down .
being extra class ham , i like radios that can "go with me"
this radio is a very nice addition ! hardly ever talk on it , but use it to listen to traffic reports in conjunction with a k30 antenna
i have received very good reports when i have transmitted with it
all of it is features work very well as advertised
i have it mounted in my work truck using a shaped coat hanger
also , i am using a radio shack mic i originally purchased and used for my icom , and rs ham hts
this mic has a '' jack on the connector so i also have an extension speaker hooked up to it
has great volume this way , with the convienance of a real mic
can not go wrong with this one
just get it !
as hanheld the range is very poor
forget about using it inside a car , it will not pick anything , not even the weather channels
running on batteries as a handheld picks up car engine noise from even <NUM> feet away
paired with midland mobile cb antenna for use in the car and while the range has greatly improved , there is a lot of noise , making it hard to understand any conversations
the antenna was tunned with a swr meter to about 2 : 1 , which is great , but noise still present
noaa channels were clear the first two days but now barely work
also picks engine noise
tried using chokes on dc powerline and also on rf but no luck , engine noise still present
i got this to use on my car as i spend quite sometime on the road but for now i am quite disappointed after a week of usage and tweaking
it should work right out of the box ! going on a trip to canada this week so i will be testing it further ( 1200mile trip ) then i will decide if to exchange it or just get a refund and look for some other solution
the idea is great
love it
the implementation sucks
: (
works great
i pretty only use it out on the trail when i am wheelin
i installed a 4' antenna gets much better reception and range
i like it because i can take it out when i am done so less chance of someone stealing it
also very easy to use
cb radio is what every trucker needs and this one did me just fine
like it a lot
just don not understand why i need to write <NUM> characters about the product .
i was intent on using an old cobra <NUM> in my new suv but when i tested it ( hadnt been used in about eight years ) there was no transmitting
it is not worth getting a $40 and <NUM> year old unit fixed so i was in the market for a new cb
sadly there is no room to easily mount a pro size cb in my xterra and cubbies and flat spots are scarce
the midland along with the cobra <NUM> wxst seem to be better than a handheld only cb
the cobra may be nice but the midland is so much more versatile
you can use the inside or outside of the car with battery power ( both adapters for alkaline and rechargeable batteries as is a charger for nimh or nicad batteries ) and a rubber ducky antenna , outside with batteries and antenna or in car with dc power and an external antenna
with the rubber duck antenna range is very limited for transmitting but it receives cb and weather okay
with an external antenna you give up nothing over a "regular" cb
i mounted my antenna to the roof rack and have a <NUM> ft firestik fs and a <NUM> foot firestick firefly to use as needed
with the <NUM> foot reception and transmission are worlds apart from the rubber antenna as is weather
with the <NUM> foot antenna i get all three noaa weather stations and two are miles away and transmitting can reach out easily miles which is fine for legal cb power
the main cons i have is the lack of a constant backlight and lack of cover for bnc connector when not using the rubber antenna .
this is a great little cb radio
it is ability to be used in the car/truck with an external antenna , easily hooked up and moved from car to car
or it can be used as a portable hand held unit
which is nice if you are a truck driver , backing up and someone is guiding you in the dock , you can hear them over your main cb in the cab
a lot of thought went into this unit
the weather channels , the seperate battery packs
one for rechargeables , and another for regular batteries
just plug it in to recharge
the quality makes this a solid little unit .
i have owned this radio for five year is and it is a great radio ! if you are going to buy this , to use in your car you "will" need to buy a cb adaptor and a roof mount antenna or else it will not work inside your car ! if you are going to use this for outside ! you "will" need to buy a hand held radio bnc telescoping antenna for longer range use ! the small antenna that this comes with has a very short range and you will not be happy with it
other than that ! this is a great radio and has a full <NUM> watt is output like any other cb radio
i have read some of the bad review is on here and they are so wrong , i had to put my two cents in on this radio ! so ! remember , its all about the antenna ! thank is
the discription sounded good but after i bought it and put it to use , i found it to be "not as advertised" and returned it .
defective unit , scan function worked <NUM> out of 30
battery trays are very poorly made
the eight battery compartment would not power the unit
if the unit was working as designed i would have great concern for the longevity of the battery holders
as they were not straight in the compartments with slight alignment issues
audio was acceptable and it did bring in the noaa clearly .
i would to have give this one star out of the box i could not get anything the weather channel came in great all the other channels not so much also would say get a outdoor antenna that help a lot now i can hear some people on radio also the cigarette adapter is great the only problem i have is when i hit the gas on my truck i can hear my engine threw the cb speaker which lowers the quality of the sound i have to shut my truck off so i can not hear my engine threw the cb speaker
i would not buy this cb at all not worth the money and pain the only good channel i found again was the weather channel
very unhappy with this cb
i ordered the in may of 2006
the receiver went "deaf" in august and i returned it to midland for warranty repair
they sent me a replacment in september , and by november the receiver had failed in the new one
the radio will not pick up anything even with the squelch all the way down
when the radio would receive signals , the audio was so distorted that you could not understand what was being said
the transmitter in both units still worked
don not waste your money .
this does exactly what it is suppossed to do
i can use it as a portable cb when i am out of the car or in the vehicle with an external cb antena while on the road
weather radio is a big plus as it comes in handy whether camping or in the house and expecting bad weather
good example - tornado season
keep the radio with me when going to the basement for weather updates and if worst case happens , then still have comunication with the outside world .
i have a small car without much room for a traditional under dash cb
i bought this to communicate from car to car on a road trip
it works quite well
car to car range is about <NUM> mile in heavy urban traffic , about <NUM> miles on the open road ( as long as there is no hill between you and the other car )
converts quickly to a handheld with the supplied battery pack and short rubber antenna
range is only about 1/4 to 1/2 mile in this configuration , but could probably be improved with an extendable antenna
i especially appreciate that midland supplies different battery packs to take either rechargeable or disposable batteries
only <NUM> minor gripe
the belt clip is spring steel and will scratch any belt you hang it on
i would prefer a plastic squeeze clip like that found on many cell phones , or on industrial walkie talkies
other than that i am very satisfied .
the first thing i noticed about this radio was how quiet it was ! in the city there is almost always a ton of background chatter
with the squelch set just over the noise level only talk came through when there was talk that could be heard
i haven not had time to put the radio on the road but i am impressed so far ! it is made to move from car to car and does so easily
a magnet mount antenna and a 12v power port and you are on the air ! included are a &<HASHTAG> ; rubber ducky&<HASHTAG> ; antenna , alkaline battery pack , and rechargeable battery pack to turn the radio into a walky/talky
the recharge pack is the one point i am not sure of yet
a power pack can be plugged into the side rather than taking batteries out and putting them back in for charging
what is not clear is which battery type can be used ( or nimh )
convention would be
i will do an update at a later time when i find out more
. mark
we have a travel trailer and needed a cb radio , which turned out to be hard to find anywhere other than online
with that said this is a great little tool and we are very happy with the purchase
i can not speak to how it compares with others since the last cb my husband and i had any contact with was back in the 70 is so in that regard this little number is quite an improvement
: )
i purchased this because of how compact it was however i barely got a <NUM> foot range with it
i asked the local cb repair shop if there was anything i could do to fix the range on it , they said get a real cb , the compact all in one handset units are not worth it .
i have had cb is since the late 1970 is
cobras , unidens , and most others
midland does , and always has made a good product
this is no different
the handhelds are great if you are in an rv campsite looking for others , or on the road , searching for traffic info
face it , the 1970 is are gone - and even then , power jacked skip talkers ruined a lot of 'otherwise friendly' local chats
in the area i am working near canada , i get really tired of skip talking power hounds out of orlando florida blasting so hard to talk to someone in la , that you can not hear your neighbor a mile away
face it , we aren not buying bad radios , we are being stomped on by illegal users like these guys
don not think badly of the midland 75hh
it is a good little radio
it is output with a 'lil wil' magnet mount antenna is comparable to a cobra 29ltd with a suitable tuned antenna
get your swr 1
1 : 1 or so on 20 , get <NUM> and <NUM> as close as you can , and you should have no problems reaching out a few miles
on a good day , you can get miles
and that is all they are really designed for
don not forget , the more sunspots , the further you can reach
and sunspots are starting to pick up now
good radio
i gave it , because they have never offered this handheld with a mated external antenna
maybe i expect too much
( but you can get almost the same thing in a dash mount , and add an antenna , for the same price ) .
cool little radio , transmits very well , but reception is very poor
low volume and what seems to be high level of background hum on receive
not sure if i can live with it
will come back and revise with full eval later .
i really like this cb
it has the ability to transmit quite well with a dedicated whip
if you like this sort of thing like i do you will really enjoy its compact size and features
technology is a trip .
i was looking for a radio in case of emergency situations , and this was the perfect solution
more people have cb is then any other type of radio because of the truck drivers , so i know there is a better then average chance i could reach someone else in an emergency with this radio
i live fairly close to one of the busiest freeways in the u
, and can get a signal with this if i step outside of my house
i purchased a simple magnetic car antenna , and love how easy it is to swap this from car power to handheld power , so i know i will be ready either way
the sound isn not super loud , but i can drive with the heater on full blast and the windows cracked on the freeway and hear it if it is near my head
i have had no complaints about the sound quality , and get fairly good reception ( so far <NUM> miles with the car mounted antenna for certain ) most cb is require a calibrated antenna of a certain length for maximum range , so i am certain i could get farther range with a smal amount of effort , this functions as well as my old truck mounted cb i had when professionally driving
great for camping , we talked the whole way down with the car mounts , then kept in touch in the park with the handheld packs
has a powersave option that keeps you going as long as your batteries can stand ( i had to buy <NUM> rechargeable aa batteries seperately for the charger pack ) we did have a few issues when on the far side of the park from each other , but getting to higher ground put us back in touch again ( this was a mapped distance of <NUM> miles from hilltop to hilltop ) i have had otehr small scale cig lighter powered radios and this one has been better in every reguard
the unit doesn not overheat , hasn not blown a fuse , and functions just like you'd expect a quality item to
standard mounts and plugs for everything but a talk mic
you can purchase a headset unit , or else you will have to use this as if it were a standard cb mic , but you can easily plug any headphone jack in for headphone or external speaker sound
overall this is a really functional , solidly built , hybrid design for the driver in need of a radio
i'd recommend anyone who doesn not wish to purchase and install a full blown cb in their personal vehicle buy one of these , the more people around you with one , the better off you will be in an emergency situation .
i have this attached to a 2' firestik on my jeep and it seems to work just fine for our trail runs where we are within a mile of one another
i really don not use cbs for anything more -- like chatter with truckers and whatnot
it is got some cool features , but honestly , i haven not used them
either way , this thing is good for what i use it for
plus , when camping , we can go mobile with it
good buddy .
i needed a cb for when i go
after a lot of research , i bought this radio
in conjunction with a 4' firefly antenna and a few minutes with an swr meter , i can send and receive as far as i need to .
i gave this as a gift that was
i have been told that it works great and is appreciated .
updateok , i received a replacement radio from midland
it took about <NUM> weeks for the replacement to arrive
it came in a small brown box , not the retail package that i sent it in
all the parts were piled in the box with packing peanuts
the radio and accessories were all fine , not beat up or scratched
i guess it didn not look expensive enough for ups to bother trying to smash to pieces
the only thing wrong was the wrist strap was not in the box
i probably wouldn not have used it anyway
i put some rechargeable batteries in the battery holder and turned the radio on
and i was receiving skip , so the problem was fixed with what is probably a ( refurbished ) radio
looks new though and it works
i should not have had to pay shipping to have a defective radio replaced but that is life
i like the radio ! received the radio and placed the batteries in the battery holder and turned the unit on
did not receive any cb signals but not too suprised with the flexible antenna
checked out the weather channels and received them fine
took the radio out to the truck and installed the vehicle adapter and connected the radio to a wilson <NUM> antenna and flipped through all <NUM> cb channels
nothing but background hiss
i backed the squelch all the way off and got the same result
connected the cobra 75wxst back to the antenna and received skip on almost all channels
reconnected the , checked the swr , all channels below 2 , still no cb reception
packed the radio back in the box , called midland , sent radio to midland and now i will wait for a few weeks and think about the extra $10
00 it cost to own this radio due to shipping to midland
customer service at midland was pleasant and spoke english
i could have sent the radio back to abetterwaytobuy but the turn around time from midland seems to be shorter than the long wait i had the first time from abetterwaytobuy
also i think that midland will probably be sure that i get a working unit when they send one back
so , i can not comment much on the radio itself as far as performance but will update this once i get the radio returned .
and i have owned my for more than <NUM> years
my is reliable , compact and its wx weather capability is priceless
( on one occasion , i didn not know that a small rainstorm that i was driving in was actually the leading edge of a hurricane
i did manage to outrun the hurricane , thanks to my good luck in finding out *exactly* what i was driving in
) it can be quickly converted to a cb portable walkie talkie
i do recommend this unit
i got it many years ago , new , on ebay for $45
you can use that for comparison , if you wish to
new addition : now i own the also
-----------------in my opinion , midland has produced an *extraordinary* unit here
it can be used as a
it comes with two different battery to provide power for this purpose
one is designed for conventional batteries
the other is for rechargeable batteries , and the includes an ac power supply to recharge the batteries
it can also be used in a vehicle
another is provided for this purpose and will connect it to the 12v plug and to the external antenna
if you use a antenna , you can move the entire package from vehicle to vehicle in *less than five minutes
* time it yourself and by the way , i recommend a antenna* because it is so easy to transfer your cb rig from one car to another
it can be used as noaa weather radio
i now own three cbs , two of them purchased in the last month
each time i shop around for a new cb , i compare *all* the brands *carefully
* i keep coming back to midland
i have owned my first midland ( ) for more than ten years ; it is never failed me
* remark : amazon has for sale , the procomm jbc101 , a little stubby "rubber duckie" magnetic antenna which you can plop in the *center* of your automobile roof for even radiation in all directions
you can remove it in an instant ( for carwash , for example ) and put it back again later
i have two magnetic antennas
i didn not pay more than $20 for either one of them .
as a backup for when you are traveling in areas with spotty cellphone coverage this is a nice to have device
also , listening to drivers is entertaining ( unless you are offended by blue language
) well made , switches into hand portable format in seconds
great range with a vehicle antenna .
opened the box and was impressed with the appearance
started to review each piece
the battery packs are a bit flimsy
put the fresh aa batteries in one pack and <NUM> rechargables in the other and went outside to try it
only heard static on the cb bands
tried the weather bands and heard wx <NUM> loud and clear
hooked up the radio in my car and connected the outside antenna , same result on cb bands
tried a second mobil antenna on car with same results
checked antenna with another cb and it worked
it appears that the midland is a very attractive toy but not really a usable cb
glad i bought it from amazon so there is no problem returning .
i bought this and sent it back almost immediately
it felt really flimsy and the battery pack seemed like a toy .
it works as advertised
you are not going to blow anyone is doors off or get <NUM> miles with it but , it works
its not really loud turned all the way up and if you live in an area where cell phone use while drivin is prohibited , this may cause issues with cops as it looks like your texting on a cell phone
( ? ) i dont how thats going to go over
basically just tune the channel and squelching it is real easy with the knob on top , the other knob is volume
fits nice in the hand and easy to use
i have never had to mess with all those other buttons
but anyway , i keep this in my truck to hand to someone else to use on the fly ( with rubber duck antenna ) so i can communicate with them
i have a peaked and tweaked cobra unit installed in my truck so no matter what this thing is doin i can get to them and pull them in and hear them should we get distanced on the road .
this is a small cb it works good and has some nice features
i would recommend this product if you are looking for a versatile handheld cb .
after reviewing the opinions on this unit a friend of mine and myself decided to make the purchase anyway
there were <NUM> star and <NUM> star reviews
after several days of testing the two new units on our motorcycles and while on a 2 , 000 mile road trip we simply put the units in our saddle bags and never turned them on again
both transmission and reception distances are shameful
even when using no ground plane antennas
straight hand held to hand held transmission distance was only about <NUM> feet
we also got the same results when transmitting and receiving from a motorcyle that had a built in cb
his trans and rec was great but ours was terrible
the unit is fantastic for receiving weather info but it should not be listed to communicate for <NUM> miles
2' is more like it .
i have had this radio for about one month now
the speaker stopped working
i had to buy an external speaker
i saw several complaints about the same issue when i was researching the radio
however , the radio still transmits very well and receives well also
i continue to recommend it but i suggest purchasing an external speaker when you buy the radio .
this unit fills a niche for those who want basic cb capabilities in a convenient and flexible form
this is not for people who want great range or will rely on for emergency use .
first it is not a big trucker radio it is more your nosey and want to listen in and get weather or you mudding with friends and u need to be in communication for that its great or on a <NUM> wheeler
i love this raidio , it worked so good , i had to come back to buy a second ! i was leaning toward a cobra , with some reservations , and when i saw this one , it was the clear winner .
can be used as either a handheld unit or a permanent install
great value as it comes with a battery back for regular aa , a rechargeable battery pack for rechargeable aa is and the vehicle mounted cable for power and signal .
i bought this cb radio for my jeep
i use it when i am wheeling with my jeepin' buddies and it works very well
i like how i can plug it into my jeep cig lighter or snap on the mobile battery pack and take it on the go .
this little "convertible" isn not much bigger than some cb microphones
i am particularly pleased with the three modes of power ; aa batteries , nimh rechargeables , or 12v vehicle
the mobile vehicle adapter includes both a cigarette lighter power point and a coax connector for an external antenna
i use the midland magnetic mount ( it will tune to swr of about 1
5 on channels <NUM> and 40 ) to significantly increase the range to several miles , depending on conditions
as a mobile radio , it works pretty well given that it is a one ( small ) size fits all type of unit
but what i really got this for was to use it as a handheld
and that is where it truly shines
the provided rubber duckie antenna is nice and short , but it severely limits your transmit range
use it if you don not need to talk more than a couple hundred yards
i mounted the cobra ha ta telescoping whip antenna and got a tremendous increase in performance
battery life is pretty good
the rechargeables will last all day with reasonable usage
plug it into the charger overnight and you are ready for the next day
the weather alert is a nice feature , too
all in all , a very useful small radio that really comes to life when connected to a decent antenna
recommended for those who need a versatile cb for automobile and handheld applications .
i really don
t care for cb is but i do drive a lot and this one has saved me a lot of time and money
hard to believe that you can get everything you need built in to the mic without having to mount a permanent unit under your dash
easily moved from car to car without tools and trouble , i highly recommend this to anyone needing a cb
great cb for light use
i love that it doesn not have a whole box to mount
makes it possible to install discretely without tearing up your dash
and i love having the weather band
my only gripe is that there is not a black cap to put over the silver portable antenna outlet for a cleaner look when it is mounted in a vehicle
i have tried to find something to put over it and i keep striking out
maybe somebody can suggest something ?
purchased this cb from best buy
it would not work with batteries or the power source in the vehicle
most difficult to get the battery pack open and off the cb in the beginning but once i made a call to the company i figured out that you must mash a button and slide the battery pack off the cb
after going through that it didn not work
i am sending it back and will not be reordering .
i can not tell how well it works because i have yet to receive any voice on any channel , and i live within sight of one of the interstate highways by
maybe reception will improve once it is mounted on my truck with a better antenna - it couldn not get any worse .
ok - my first cb
i love this thing
so far so good
good quality and looks durable
i did go buy an external antenna to boost reception ( $15 )
i will be testing this more this weekend when i go with a buddy and his cb
i recommend this .
killer compact cb for motorcycle or any vehicle
even if you rarely have need for emergency roadside communication this radio has options that exceed many full size cb radios
mujltiple freq scanning and programmable favorites
instant access to the channels you follow
compact , portable and simple to use .
no space in yukon so just what i needed
purchased an external speaker so works just like the big boys except for a little less range
great radio
i bought with to be portable
has the ability to plug in the cig lighter or use batteries
also can plug in an antenna if you want
range is short with the stubby , but that is to be expected
love that is has the scan feature and weather
for the price it is hard to beat .
i purchased this unit for a road trip
i was very disappointed with the quality
if i could return it at this point i would
range is less than <NUM> feet without an external antenna mounted to the vehicle
i have had other handhelds in the past with much better reception .
the midland <NUM> channel cb radio is a solid handheld cb with just a few flaws that prevent it from being absolutely great
if you are looking for a truly portable cb radio this is the one to get bar none
it is important to understand the capabilities of this radio
many people rate radios poorly because their expectations far exceed the capability of the radio
most cb radios are <NUM> watts which is generally good for a distance of miles
as with any radio there are a lot of variability is that will impact the effectiveness of the radio
cb radios are not for long distance communications
if you need long distance comms then you should consider a ham radio which requires a license from the fcc
pros : + multiple methods to power the radio : car charger , alkaline batteries , and rechargeable batteries+ <NUM> watts+ weather channels work great and can be very valuable+ quick button to transfer between channels <NUM> and 19+ very easy to use+ radio itself is well built+ can use high setting for <NUM> watts or low setting for <NUM> watt which will save batteriescons : -the adapter for the car charger and alkaline batteries are very stiff when removing from the alkaline and rechargeable battery cases seem delicate especially when being separated to put the batteries in the case
time will tell how durable these will be over the long run
recommendations : + upgrade your antenna to thecobra cb antennawhich , in my case , significantly improved reception
it is also good to have a backup antenna
+ get thewilson little wil magnet mount antennafor your vehicle
you will not get reception if you use the rubber duck antenna in your vehicle
+ get the bookemergency radio communicationsby caleb watts for a good understanding of radio capabilities , rules & regulations , and a good example of an emergency radio plan
overall assessment : the midland <NUM> channel cb radio is a very flexible cb radio that can be used in multiple situations such as in your vehicle or out hiking
the radio itself is very well made and while the battery cases seem a little problematic they are not a deal breaker but they do cause me to give this radio <NUM> stars instead of 5
if you are looking for a handheld cb radio the midland is a great choice .
i read a couple reviews that urged me to buy only a new midland , but being thrifty i decided to buy an amazon return product
mistake ! fail ! i know you can save money buying refurb , but in this case my refurbed radio was missing the key part : the mobile assembly adapter ( i
car power/antenna adapter )
so , while i could use it at home , it was worthless in the car ! i will update my review after i receive the new one i just ordered
my suggestion if you buy this ( and the product is well regarded ) : buy new
and only new
if you ignore this warning , be sure you check for all the parts and return if you don not get them
i read about so many people that say , "well , it was missing so and so , but i just kept it anyway
" no ! just my <NUM> cents
buy new ! update july 2012 : i did return the original used radio and bought new
this is a really nice product and i have revised my review to <NUM> stars
i got this for backup communications in the event cell towers go down ( natural or disasters ) and i fully believe it will serve wonderfully in that capacity
just be sure to practice a bit with it and become proficient before you really need it .
installed this in my 4x4 , fits entirely in the center console when i am not using it
with a 3' firestik antenna i have had conversations with base stations <NUM> miles away
overall love it for being compact and versatile .
i bought this because i didnt want to install a hard mount cb
i park on the street
when i park at night all i do is slide it out of the holder and take with me just like my radio face plate
volume output is barely adequate
i like how the acc plug and exterior ant are integrated into one piece
makes it easy to talk feel like you have mike on regular cb
i like the buttons for dual watch and scan which are easy to press by feel when driving
it will beep when sw is made
the receive seems to be good and tx is good
you cant do much with 3
5 watt output ! so much for freedom of choice ! uncle sam wont let me up the power
; ) everyone is abiding by that rule : )
be honest
if you buy this ( cb transceiver radio ) you are going to need a miracle to make if work
i tested with my girl friend
as soon as i walk away <NUM> meter from her , i couldn not heard anything and get any signali am not sure how can people give <NUM> star review to this product
maybe they all use the external antenna to get better signal
sorry to say that not what i want
i use to have a motorola walkie talkie
work better that this like 100x time
sorry midland co
i am not try to destroy your reputation
quality is what we want .
wow , great unit , like the battery saver , memory keys , scans channels for activity
battery life is super like other reviews have said
have to have a cobra adapter to use the magnetic roof mount
the unit does just as well ( with roof mount ) as my old unit that has the tradition attached mike , and i can take it out easy when parked
i don not talk much , just listen- ( the unit is hard to bring up and face to talk because of all the wires attached
this packs a lot of features for a decent price
the different power options are great
if you are going to use it for distances farther than car to car , you need a bigger antennae or a roof top one
i purchased this through amazon
the first one was late and determined lost in shipping
amazon immediately sent another one overnight one day delivery
it worked great accept for the rechargeable battery transceiver and plug
the plug didn not seem to fit completely into the transceiver , so amazon shipped it back at no cost sent another unit out <NUM> day post
that unit has the exact same issue
it will not charge rechargeable batteries which is its sole purpose
i even went out and bought eight new radioshack rechargeable aa , cost $38 , to make sure it wasn not the batteries
it wasn not
this unit gets noa crystal clear in my truck as well , but no cb channels get any reception
instead of shipping this one back to amazon for a fourth unit or just returning it and moving on to another cb maker , i called midland radio and they are sending me a new rechargeable transceiver and plug
if that doesn not work it goes back and i will buy elsewhere .
worked as expected
easy to setup using and following instructions
use it every day
its a little long but works fine .
this antenna isn not going to provide great range or performance , but it works ok in situations where you can not easily hard wire a cb antenna
i installed it on my travel trailer window , to avoid drilling a hole in the roof or exterior wall
works fine for short range cb communications in the campground , which is all i wanted to begin with .
no way to set the swr and an operating range of only a couple car lengths made me regret this purchase .
this through the glass unit performed well enough for my needs as i am only looking for local traffic information of autos
the problem is that it will not stay on the windshield
i am on my third unit in an attempt to get it to stay on permanently instead of a few weeks
the first one was put on by professional installers of all my 3rd party electronics
have dealt with them for years as they do excellent work
it fell off and was lost after about <NUM> days
the second one i put on myself
and followed the directions to an exact degree
including the heating of the glue with a hair dryer for <NUM> minutes
cleaning the windshield as directed etc etc
using silicon to seal the unit further
this one stayed on for more than a month and then fell off and was lost
the third one was supplied to me directly by midland at no charge , much to their credit
i havent tried putting on the third one yet because of the weather
i have my fingers crossed
would i buy this again
definitely not
probably no through the glass units from anyone else either .
which isn not too long
in fact , only about <NUM> miles or so
after <NUM> hours of setting up the adhesive ( and i am in the adhesives business ! ) it should have been ready to use
driving down the hiway i heard a clatter and clunk and , poof , gone
i see it went from $[
] bucks at amazon to $[
] thru a market place seller
but even for a saw buck it is expensive if it flies off the car
to amazon is credit , they of course took it ( the remaining parts ) back
but strike against midland , who wasn not there for <NUM> miles of my trip due to poor engineering and design .
unless you are looking for very , very short range communication
if you only use the radio for traffic jam info or in a convoy you will not be happy with the performance
i got this to avoid the redneck look , tuned it ( 1
3 : 1 highest ) and was not getting more than maybe 3/4 mile when i tested with a buddy who has a known good rig in his truck
put the $18 toward something better and go with a magnet mount or properly grounded body mount antennamy windows are polarized and from what i understand that can cause issues with these antennas
i have been told that older , glass will allow the signal to pass from inside to outside more easily
works real nice no trouble with the set screw to hold the antenna in place also has instructions on setting it
the antenna was sturdily made and was a better quality than the one i was replacing
the connection points were well thought out to allow ease of installation .
i attached the antenna to the rear window on my jeep wrangler , and hooked it up to a cobra radio
reception was poor at anything over <NUM> yards
transmission was nil
i don not know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance , but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that
on a positive note , it was very simple to install .
this thing does not work
if you buy it you will throw it away , swr is are always high , and can not be set , it may look cool but that is all it has going fo it .
the biggest thing about this telescope is its size , not how big it is but how small it is
small means easy to carry , and that means you will be more motivated to take it out and look at things
more importantly you will take it to good 'dark sky' locations
even with the meade deluxe tripod this scope is easily carried with one hand , that and a simple set up make it fun to use
the super plossil zoom eyepiece is a great accessory , and the astrostar lets even clutzs like me find cool things to look at .
i am truly an amateur astronomer
my childhood was peppered with telescopes that showed me a new blurry world
when i got the i expected little more than a brighter blur
to my surprise and delight i was wrong
out of the box , in bad lighting conditions , surrounded by trees , i saw some of the most images of the moon
in fact , i spent the next six hours observing the moon
i saw craters in detail
i even saw some craters within craters
i did venture to a bright star i saw in the sky
it turned out to be jupiter
it was a highly recognizable jupiter
not another dot in the sky
i could see three of jupiter is moons in orbit
i couldn not even make out jupiter is moons with the naked eye
i tried the telescope during the day for terrestrial viewing
once again i was pleasantly surprised ! the local river area came alive with wildlife
the photographic possibilities are endless ! i purchased the <HASHTAG> deluxe field tripod , <HASHTAG> <NUM> degree erecting prism , <HASHTAG> autostar controller , and the <HASHTAG> hard case with the telescope
i highly recommend you do the same
they all add to the total experience
the tripod is a must for both astrological and terrestrial viewing
the <NUM> degree erecting prism is needed for terrestrial viewing
if you don not use it , your images will be inverted
the autostar , once aligned , will position the telescope to any viewable object , and then continue to track it
the case is a convenience and insurance policy .
the has magnification of 48x ; great for looking at the moon
however , if you want to look at any planets or stars , you _definitely_ need the optional eyepieces so you can have some control over magnification
without these optional eyepieces , you have no control over magnification .
i read all the reviews before buying
and was a little worried that it might not meet expectations
but it has worked out great
it was a thrill to see saturns rings and view jupiter
the moon comes through bright and clear
you can see other heavenly objects ( even galaxies ! ) with it
you won not see galaxies and nebula in the same detail as you do in books - but you will see the dim shading of them in parts of the sky
it is compact and portable - so you can bring it to the beach , etc
our neighborhood is way to bright to use it for much viewing - so portability was a must
a scope that gave a better view , at the same price , would have been too big
and a better portable would have cost too much
this one was just right for us
if price is not a problem , get a better portable scope
if size is not a constraint , then spend less on a larger scope
otherwise , this one will do fine
must have add ons : a tripod ( see my review there )
the computer controller ( you will never find a lot of the night sky objects without one )
one or two good night sky books ( to help you find cool objects like binary stars and galaxies )
complaints : it would be nice for this ( and all scopes ) to see some pictures of how objects will really look with it before buying .
the etx is in many ways a marvelous little scope
optically , it is far and above most 90mm catadioptric scopes , like the celestron 90
mechanically , though , it leaves a bit to be desired
there are a few too many flimsy plastic parts , the clock drive is not terribly accurate , and the drive clutch has way too much slop in it
the human engineering aspect leaves a lot to be desired as well
the finder scope is almost impossible to use as set up
the mount makes it impossible to view though the scope or finder in many orientations
what meade tried to do here is create a clone of the $4 , 000 questar at a bargain price
optically they have done well ( though it still falls short of a questar ) but in copying the mechnical design opf the questar they had to leave out precisely those details that make the questar such a pleasure to use
the $599 price is a little misleading
while designed for tabaletop use , unless you have a cast concrete tabletop you will need a solid tripod to support it , so you can add another $150 right there , bringing the actual cost to more like $749
and for that price there are a lot of good choices around
they make not look as slick , but they are a lot more usable .
i bought with tripod from the guy in scottsdale , he claimed that "he never used it"
well , he lied and this mead telescope was broken , it do not turn left or right , something with the the gears inside of it ( i can hear noise of the engines )
after research i realized that i can not fix it because it is made very flimsy , so it is unrepairable
mead customers support sad that they don not have parts for it because it is discontinued and will not repair it ( not speaking that it would be costly repair if they had parts )
$400 wasted
don not buy used
if somebody need telescope with broken and tripod , let me know .
we purchased the etx <NUM> and we found the autostar to be necessary
it was very easy to plug into the telescope and turn on , but getting the telescope aligned was another story
the first night we went out with just the autostar and the telescope , assuming that we would have enough to get started
we were very wrong
in order to align the telescope and get the autostar working , the unit first asked us to find true north
yikes ! we gave it a rough guess
we were off compleetely , we would find out the next evening
next was the exact time , which we also guessed on our inaccurate watches
then we picked the nearest city , which is about <NUM> minutes away
then the unit asked us to find two stars in the sky and identify and align them in the telescopes eyepiece
the stars that the autostar gave us to find were not exactly stars , and they werent in a part of the sky that was devoid of other bright stars
without a map of the sky , we were lost
pollox , rigel , castor were some of the stars we have come to know well through the autostar
needless to say , we did not get the autostar working that night
the next night , we went out equipped with not only the scope and the autostar unit , but also a compass ( to find north ) , a detailed map of the sky ( to find the stars it was asking us to ) , and a watch that had accurate time on it
before we headed out , we took the time to enter in our exact latitude and longitude into the autostar
that night was a great success
after a short time spent aligning our two base stars in the scope , we were off to explore the universe and beyond
we saw saturn , venus , jupiter , the pleiades , the orion nebula and several messier objects that evening
i highly recommend the autostar , but wish that the booklet would have warned us that we needed to be prepared with the compass , star map , latitude/longitude , and exact time to make our experience with it successful
the only drawback to the unit was that it needs to be aligned and reset every time it is used , but its not like there are other competing units to use
its well worth the money , and enhances the experience with any meade scope .
the astrostar is a great etx accessory
my favorite feature is its &quot ; give me a tour of what is good tonight
&quot ; it is also great for figuring out what your looking at with its &quot ; identify this&quot ; feature
the only drawback is you have to be really careful aligning the scope initially to get it to work
the instructions weren not that clear between the scope , the tripod , and the astrostar book
my recommendations to you , remember to align the scope to true north ( i hold a compass on the lens tube ) , use a bubble level to level the tube , set your watch to the second on the nights you go out , and make sure the viewfinder and scope are well aligned
do these four things and i guarantee you will have a great night of viewing .
this controller really became valuable to me after the first <NUM> or <NUM> viewing sessions with my new
after the newness of just pointing the telescope at the brightest object in the sky wore off , the controller assisted me with finding all kinds of new objects to look at
it took some work for me to get the telescope aligned with the controller
i had to learn the reference stars that the controller uses to align the telescope
once i learned the reference stars , the unit becomes essential for me to really enjoy this hobby
i cannot imagine using my telescope without this controller !
there are two schools of thought on the use of telescopes
one school believing that it takes away all the skill and fun from astronomy
however , i am a believer in the other viewpoint
i think capability opens up astronomy to the masses and brings the universe just that little bit closer to everyone
i purchased the autostar for my etx about a year ago and it has had extensive use
out of the many many times i have used the autostar with the scope , i estimate it has performed as desired on <PERCENT> of my viewing nights
unusually , i seem to be able to align my etx rather easily depsite the fact that many people have difficulty
i think i have had luck on my side as the etx , while a beautiful scope , can be a little temperamental
even after doing a quick and rough alignment , like pointing it in the general direction of due north , without using a compass , i still get very accurate results with the autostar
i even changed locations the other day , moving from auckland to taupo , ( some <NUM> hrs travel distance by car ) and inadvertantly used the auckland while viewing in taupo
suprisingly after alignment , i still got accurate positioning from the autostar
once you get the hang of the menu system the autostar is really quite simple to navigate around
the amount of data is staggering , but given the size of the playground , it is not suprising
the unit itself is comfortable to hold and the adjustable brightness makes reading the screen simple in the dark
i havn not found the built in red light at the top of the unit very good as it is just too dim to make out charts etc
the trusty old torchlight with red nail polish on the lens is hard to beat on that score
i suggest that if you are operating from a tripod , you attach something to the back of your autostar that lets you hang it up on the tripod when you are not using it
otherwise it can dangle around and get in the way
on a couple of occassions i have had the unit fail to operate correctly or reset itself
these have been far and few between , and readily fixed itself
ultimately the autostar is a computer so an occasional reset is not entirely unexpected
one minor problem i am experiencing at the moment is the scrolling text on the lower line of the display panel is tending to fade a little the faster it scrolls
this has occured since i started using a power adapter for the scope so this will need investigating
this however is only a minor niggle
if you have any concerns about your autostar consultthe best resource on the net for the autostar , mike weasners site
the autostar is highly recommended and really an essential purchase to go along with your etx
clear skies everyone and happy alignments .
we just purchased the meade <NUM> etx telescope and decided to get the computer controller too - and man are we glad that we did
we are novices with the telescope , so finding specific objects in the night sky is a challenge
with the autostart , after taking about <NUM> minutes to go through the alignment process , we can just tell the autostar what we want to find and it moves the telescope to the object for us
without this , the only thing we would probably look at in the sky is the moon
note : if you are not planning to use your telescope to look at objects in the night sky ( i
planets , etc ) , then you don not need the autostar .
i am a rank astronomy novice
i read the autostar manual word for word twice before i dared to hook it to my scope
so far the autostar is far far too complicated for this cpa , mba to understand
the computer seems very slow to respond to commands
maybe if i read the autostar manual another dozen times i will figure some of it out
meanwhile i will use the simple controller that came with my scope
i understand that remote completely .
i have mixed feelings about this category of laptop locks
it wouldn not stop someone with a pair of good wire cutters
it will stop the casual impulsive thief who walks by in the library
anyway , as this particular product goes it is well manufactured and works smoothly
i use it in the law library ( where you know and trust most everyone ) if i have to be up and down a lot , like when i am doing research throughout the library
it provides a little peace of mind in such situations
thanks for reading
these are amazing little locks
i bought <NUM> of these to help deter people from taking my computers
these will not prevent someone that is motivated to steal it , but it will help to prevent someone from just picking it up and walking away with it when you are not looking .
here is my original review : i bought this because just received a new mbpro 13" ( ) as a gift
i am headed to help coordinate a conference tomorrow , so i ordered this lock to protect my laptop
i didn not want a combination lock because i have had those get all mixed up & unusable ( thankfully not while connected to my laptop ! ) sadly , this lock does not fit the new mbpro
i can not even get the lock into the kensington slot , plus the metal stubs scraped up the surrounding area on my brand new comp ! the scrapes aren not a *huge* deal , but i am sad , given i have only had the comp a couple weeks
now i am headed off to target in hopes of finding something
i am just sad about the ridiculous price i am gonna have to pay
if there is something i am missing , i'd love to hear about it ! here is the update : after i had no success finding a lock at target ( best buy was closed ) , i came home & worked the lock some more
i finally got it to work , but i am not sure what i did any differently : i lined up the tbar with the stubs , put it in the slot , & turned the key to the left
i just hope it doesn not act fussy when i get where i am going .
i just got back from a two week vacation and i used this lock for the first time
i looked all over the place and aside from the plumbing under the sinks -- which didn not seem like a good idea -- the only place i could loop it to was the bedframe
this is in no way critical of the device ; just you might want to consider what you are going to attach it to
the only flaw was a bit of a burr in the cable sticking through the plastic coating , which i filed down
you might want to inspect it when you take it out of the box so you don not get surprised and bleed all over the place
the cable is of course vulnerable if a thief has a substantial pair of cutters ; i lost a bicycle locked with the same kind of cable many years back
but this seems like a product , considering that limitation .
all the stores around here were selling pathetic combo locks i had to return
this works great .
as a graphic artist , i bring my laptop with me even on vacations for the sake of work emergencies
it is a 17&<HASHTAG> ; macbook pro , so it is not small enough for a hotel safe , and i hate leaving it out when i leave the room because i just don not want to tempt housekeeping in that way
packing it back up to keep it hidden every time i go out has gotten too tiresome , though , so i finally looked around and purchased this security cable
i am so glad i did
this was a fine fit for my laptop model &<HASHTAG> ; the slot for it is on the right
i wrapped the other end around a closed chair leg , so that if anyone decided to take the laptop , they'd have to take the chair with them too and call attention to themselves
i am aware that anyone really determined to take it still could , but my laptop being a fairly old model and the security cable being in place , it is really not worth it to the casual snatcher , and that is enough for my peace of mind ; it allows me to leave the laptop out on the table , ready for me to log in and get right back to work without having to unpack again and boot up .
works great - use on an imac computer used for guests in a hotel lobby
so far so good , and it doesn not stick out like a sore thumb .
i can not say it is not safe - as long as it does work
but a moment ago when i picked it from my laptop bag and wanted to lock my laptop with it , i sadly found out that the lockhole was misplaced ( god knows what had happened to it ) and i could not fit my key in
ok they said they would have a warranty but i hate such kind of trouble
i guess they could provide better product with such a price
any way since it is a touch lock ( i like the design very much ) i could still give them <NUM> stars , but not more .
i read the good reviews and i read the bad ones
more good ones then bad ones so i decided to check this lock out for myself
well , ya got this heavy cable , that yes , you can cut thru if you have cutters on hand , which people that are out to steal your unit have on hand , ya got this lock that they say is tamper proof , so someone messes with it and now you can not even unlock it tell you get help , so you have to leave it cause you got to be somewhere like class or work , and now your not in a very good mood
now that i have one of these i am a bit confused
everybody is talking about the cable and the lock and i saw where nobody mentioned the fact that this whole thing is tied to this little t shaped piece of steel that is stuck in this thin piece of either aluminum or plastic and all you have to do is grap it , pull up or down on the lock and it pulls right out with little effort
sure , laptop is a little damaged , but the guy who just stole yours doesn not care one bit
as i said in another review , how do i know this , well , i stuck it in my probook 4730s which is the thin aluminum type on the side and when i picked it up wrong and grapped it by the lock , the weight of the laptop alone was enough to pull this thing right out , and all i had to do is tap the side of the laptop a bit to bend it back and you really can not even tell it was damaged
if you want to protect your unit , don not walk away from it , and as for this lock idea , it looks good to those that are not out to steal yours , but a joke to those that are
this lock design will slow down a theif about <NUM> seconds at the most , so if your <NUM> seconds away from yours , it is gone
ps>this is the only bad review i have written , so keep that in mind if you decide to check this lock thing out with buying one .
this computer lock works great with my laptop
the key takes some trial and error to be turned correctly but it all works out in the end .
it is not rocket science to make a well functioning laptop lock
and this one works really well if you ( like me ) prefer a key over a combo lock
i only gave it a <NUM> because the first one that i ordered came with the wrong keys and i had to get a replacement .
this notebook lock and security cable is just that , it works well and has never failed
the one thing to remember is not to lose any of the two keys provided .
i purchased this security device for my old trusty ibook
while the laptop is worth like 100
00 , it does contain information and programs that are priceless to me
i am moving overseas and this cable is exactly what i was looking for
the "" fits perfectly into apple is port and is very easy to take off
i know that some other reviewers were having problems with their newer macbooks so i was a bit concerned
if you have a "vintage" ibook/powerbook/g4 this should serve you well
remember that this is not a heavy duty chain
if someone has access to your locked laptop for more than <NUM> minutes , i can think of a handful of ways to break the cable
on hindsight , if you leave this attached to a desk while you use the bathroom , i would highly doubt that someone could break this within several minutes
although anything is possible
it is still better than nothing .
the concept and the quality of the product leads me to believe it will work , when needed
it is easy to use , with part wrapped around a stationary object , and the other end entrenched in the computer
someone trying to steal the computer will break the case if the cable is attached
the cable appears to be heavy duty , and a large pair of nippers would be needed to cut it .
nothing sucks more than when you are sipping on some tea studying at a coffee shop and you need to go pee
however , you don not want to leave your lab top unattended
thank god i now have this cable to secure my investment
its lightweight and convenient .
you will always have your power cable with your notebook
what about another cable that helps with security
leave your laptop alone
it is going to be safe
i use it on my office , college and even home so nobody is going to move it from its place
if still paranoic , try the kensington soniclock motion detecting alarm
just like the alarm in your car
both great security tools .
pros : - cable is very strong- cable isn not bulky- fits into my laptop- long enough for me to use- kensington has a registration process where if you loose your keys , they send you a new replacement set- comes with a nice small rubber strap thing to wind the lock together when not in use- sleek feel which doesn not bother the handscons : - difficult to lock because sometimes the piece right in front of the locking mechanism turns- the locking mechanism is location makes it a little difficult to insert the key properlyoverall the lock is great
it is a little difficult to lock because of the way it was constructed
other then the difficulty locking it , the cable is awesome
it is very strong and bends easily so it can be anchored to something
i was very pleased with this lock and it does everything i needed/wanted it to do
i would definitely recommend this to a family member or a friend to use as well .
as one reviewer pointed out succinctly , this is a deterrent
get up and leave your laptop for a few minutes , this lock makes a good deterrent from the casual , thief
no , it won not prevent someone vandalizing your laptop
no , it won not stop a thief with a good cable cutter
so if you see anyone at the cafe or library with a cable cutter , think twice
oh , you would anyway ? i thought so
some reviewers here must think you have no common sense
so let is assume you do
you are considering this one because it is a very affordable deterrent
another kensington with an alarm may appeal to you if you want wander a few feet out of sight of your laptop , and want an audible alarm if someone tries to yank it off -- but then , who in their right mind will try to defeat a laptop with an alarm in a library ? it is all a matter of risk assessment
if you think you may be leaving your laptop in a place where passersby possess cable cutters or the knowledge to defeat alarms , then perhaps you don not want to leave our laptop at all
so this affordable little cable is a suitable deterrent where you feel it is appropriate for the risk
a relatively benign public location
your place of work where your laptop isn not accessible to anyone but employees and staff
a hotel , where only the staff have access to your room
these are places where the risk of theft is minimized , and this cable lock is probably quite appropriate .
this is an excellent security cable
long enough to allow one to secure your laptop to something large or fixed to the room construction
i bought this one to replace one that i had a few years ago ( my wife abducted it )
on my macbook pro the for the cable is on the right hand side
the lock works smoothly and reliably
dr z .
this lock has a "" feature
if the lock is tampered with the lock goes into "lockdown" mode , and the owner is key will not be able to open the lock
here is what i was told by kensington tech support : if anyone tries to open the lock without the proper key , using an alternate key or a pin , etc
, the lock will go into "lockdown" mode
the company claims you need to hire a locksmith to open a lock once it is in lockdown mode , and they will reimburse you up to $80 of your expenses
this sounds insane to me
the lock should be hard for a thief to open
but i want to be able to open my own lock without professional assistance , even if someone tried to tamper with it .
works great , but very obvious ! does the job we are asking it to do , with no complaints
great that it has two keys .
was on my way to a trade show and worried my laptop might leave me for another
the kensington did the job .
locks up nicely to any stationary object
keeps laptop secure from random hands picking it up and taking it
long enough to secure it and still have freedom to move it around the desk .
product seems well made , although you can not stop anyone who is determined to bring the necessary tools to cut the cable
hopefully it will slow someone down , or at least keep an honest person honest .
what it is : security lock for kensington compatible devices
why you need it : this is great for a dorm room or other location to provide light security for any kensington lock compatible device ( most laptops and other portable devices have have this security port )
i have used them for several years in many environments , and they work very well
why i like it : robust cable that is long enough to secure your item in most locations , reliable lock , kensington warranty
summary : this was a very good deal for the lock itself , which is why i bought 2--my customers are always looking for something like this
i would have given it <NUM> stars , but the seller is shipping fees were pretty high .
after reading some of the reviews having to do with macbooks and this item warping the plastic , i was skeptical
since the combination lock versions seem to be incredibly unreliable , i decided to give this one a try , it being a reasonably priced lock
i haven not had any problems with it so far , using it everyday for about <NUM> weeks while at work
it is very easy to use
the only thing you have to make sure is that the main flat part that goes into the slot lines up with the prongs that are on either side
its sort of hard to explain but once you have it in your hand you will see what i mean
once the prongs and flat part are aligned , the lock fits easily into the security slot
just give it one good quarter of a turn , and your mac/pc is safe
i experienced no warping of my macbook casing , in fact there is a little rubber part that separates the metal lock that the key goes in from your mac , preventing any sort of scratching
overall a good lock at a reasonable price .
i am very happy with my cable lock
although it does not make your computer equal to fort knox , it will at the very least slow a theif down
i can hang my 8lb laptop off of it , and bounce it up and down with the cable , and it holds firm ( trial conducted over my bed , a heavily padded surface )
i like how the cable swivels around the actual lock to avoid the cable kinking , and becoming cumbersome
i also like the fact that it is a key operated system
although combinations are quicker , they can be hacked in about <NUM> minutes of trying , and slipping a key in the lock and giving a quick turn can not be any simpler
just remember to keep one key in a safe place , and write the key serial number down somewhere so a replacement can be found
for the money , i don not think there is a better security option for notebook computers , unless you spend the $40 on a doberman puppy , and train it to attack computer theifs
but that would be hard
buy this lock system , and it could save you $3000 .
when it comes to notebook physical security you need a device that will deter crimes of opportunity -- such as those presented by leaving your notebook at your desk at work or at a table in a library while you browse the shelves
if you want to protect your notebook from a determined thief , buy a safe
most cable security devices are going to provide about the same amount of security so you need to focus on ease of use
if a device is easy to use , then you are more likely to use it and use it properly
the kensington system doesn not get much simpler
it consists of a cable , which is wrapped around a reasonably unmoveable object , and an attached key lock that attaches directly to your notebook is security slot
compare the kensington system with the curtis <NUM> system and you will probably agree that the kensington system is far easier to use
compare it is <NUM> piece system to the curtis system which uses a cable , a seperate metal piece that hooks to the notebook is security slot and a seperate lock that connects that piece to the cable
that is <NUM> seperate pieces , a little more effort to hook everything up and the possibility of losing that tiny metal piece the whole system depends on
i have used both the kensington and the curtis systems at work and have found the kensington system to be far easier to use
i put one key on my keyring , put the other key someplace safe and can toss the cable into my bag and be good to go
with the curtis system , i had to make use of its storage bag just so i wouldn not lose the individual pieces
i am also sure the extra effort required to setup the curtis system will prevent some people from using the device as much as they should
the kensington system costs a little more money , but it is definitely worth it
it is my choice for my personal notebook .
i got mine at a 2nd hand store for a buck and i love it but it does take some wiggling to get out
fits like a glove and very streamline
works perfectly and keeps your computer safer from the stealing temptation of others .
kensington is the best , price is good , the lock is easy and works smoothly
another great product from kensington !
just received this lock
first impressions are good , the cable is thicker than what you usually see on this type of product
the key is big and easy to locate
the ruber insert keeps your laptop from getting scratched ( not really a concern on *this* laptop )
i can confirm that the fit is loose but this does not affect how it secures to the device
there is some wiggle room but not enough that it would be able to be shimmied off
things that i am thinking of now are specific to my laptop
the kensington slot is right by my system fan , which i have a laptop that blows out <NUM> degree air
the metal lock gets very hot
perhaps being so hot will further deter would be thieves
it is no secret that cable can be cut , the hope is that no one with tools will come across your laptop and have enough time to snatch it .
locks the laptop to a table or a bar or whatever you wrap the cable around
secure and reliable lockset .
i have three of these and i am pleased with them
i leave two laptops secured to the desk at all times and the third sits in my laptop backpack ready for travel
these are light , and simple to operate
no complaints
i have used the kensington brand laptop cables for years - i think since they first came out
i lose them periodically but keep buying more
i highly recommend
as a bonus , it looks like the newer external hard drives are now being made with the laptop security "hole/notch" so you can secure these with the security cables also
very nice
my new seagate 500gb freeagent does for sure but i have seen the security features mentioned in reviews of other drives as well .
i recently bought an lg 55ln5700 smart tv and was pleasantly surprised to see that it had a kensington lock port
this is rather useful since in my country and my neighourhood , it provides me with the peace of mind i need if i go to work or on trips to know that my tv is held securely to my wall
the cable itself is made of good quality and if my <NUM> inch tv was left to be suspended by the cable , i am sure it would easily handle the weight
if you have a smart tv with a kensington lock port , and you want an extra level of security , i recommend this lock !
my daughter used this at school for her computer and it works so well best money i have spent on college
my son leaves for college next week , and may never use this lock
in the instructions , we read about the tamper proof feature
if someone tampers with the lock , you will see a red line on the lock , and no key will work
the instructions are to call the <NUM> number , which i did just to see what the next step we would take
we were told that we would have to call a locksmith , and kensington would pay up to $80 for the locksmith
so let is say my son is at the college library with his locked computer
he gets up , and someone tampers with it , or maybe some of the kids are just fooling around with it
when he returns , he cannot unlock it from the library table
so now he has to call a locksmith , and wait , possibly missing classes
what if the library is closing , the computer would have to stay there
what if he cannot get a locksmith for a day or so , the locked computer still sits at the library
we bought a combination lock .
i make sure to lock my laptop up whenever i may be away from it for a long period of time
this lock is very sturdy and quick to enable/disable
its portable , so i can take it with me on vacation to secure my laptop where ever i am .
this product does its job once you learn how to properly operate it
i first tried it on my wife is new hp laptop and it worked well
then i decided to try it on my macbook and it actually pulled the plastic frame away from the screws on the left side leaving a small hole in the frame
i quickly removed it from my macbook
since it didn not stay on my macbook long it doesn not seem to have caused any permanent damage but buyer beware if you are using this on a macbook
it will damage the frame .
i thought i was buying the kensington <NUM> but what i received from amazon was a discontinued <NUM> commercial model with an "hp approved" logo on the box and black keys
it works ok but looks cheaper than the model in the illustration
it is not worth the trouble of returning but i feel somewhat cheated since i saw an identical unit on ebay [
] .
works well on my <NUM> inch imac
it is secure enough for sure , but the attachment isn not tight against the computer
it has some jiggle room
doesn not look like this effects the security factor though .
i got this lock and the quality was great but it didn not fit
the lock was too wide to fit in the kensington lock slot on my macbook pro
it scratched everything up and then i quit trying
don not get this lock .
pros : thicker than many other cable locks i have owned
locks and unlocks easily , so you don not have to spend five minutes trying to lock , and then another five minutes trying to unlock , your computer
it does wiggle around on my netbook , which is why the rubber bumper is really nice , but doesn not wiggle around on my laptop
so whether you get the 'wiggle' people were talking about depends on the computer slot you are dealing with
it is superior in every way , though , to the kensington combination lock with the coiled cable , which is what i bought before this one
that one chewed the heck out of the plastic casing on my computer around the slot because it was so difficult to lock ! so if you are choosing between a kensington combination and a kensington key , go with the key
your poor computer casing will thank you
cons : as others have mentioned , it is a little short
also i am a bit concerned about the 'if someone tampers with it you can never unlock it again ! ' feature others have mentioned , but i will deal with that when it happens , if it does
key is a little bulky to carry
i use this as part of a security system
of course a lock alone won not stop someone with a bolt cutter
i am only hoping to slow down a casual isnatch and grab' thief who might try to take advantage of me taking a quick bathroom break in class or such .
my sister bought this lock for me as i will be going off to college soon
i have a <NUM> aluminum 15" macbook pro & this lock works well with it
it took a while to get it to work , but after reading reviews i found out that you have to align the little "t" on the lock with the <NUM> poles by inserting the key & then turning it rightwards
once you have done that you can just insert it into your laptop & give the key a slight turn ! the cable also seems like it would be pretty sturdy to discourage the average thief .
very easy to use on my dell inpsiron laptop
locks securely to the docking station or to the laptop
no complaints .
this lock is very easy to use
the only two things you need to carry around are the key and the cable itself
tie your laptop up wherever you go , especially the library ! i live on the ground floor , and my desk is right next to the window
so i keep my laptop locked up even when it is at home , so that any burglar would have a tough time breaking the window and taking off with my notebook
although , if he really wanted to , he could probably get a pair of wirecutters powerful enough to cut the cable
all in all , this cable makes me feel secure against casual thieves and i recommend it for all laptop users .
purchased four of these locks for various computers around the house , both portable and desktop types
took a little while to coordinate the latch/holding pins position to get the lock to insert into the docking slot in the first computer , mostly because of the ease with which the inserted key rotates and how easy it is to inadvertently spin the latching mechanism so it will no longer insert properly
but once you have figured out that tidbit the lock becomes simple to operate correctly and the subsequent installations became a breeze to complete
the attached encased steel cable is thick and stout , more than what you might normally see in other installations such as certain retail store security setups , for instance
this should provide relatively good protection for any computer fastened down with one of these locks
it is not to say that the computer is now impervious to theft , but the thief will now have to have a fairly set of cutters in order to get through this cable
the lock mechanism itself seem pretty solid as well ; the sort of force needed to break through one of these would likely inflict more damage to the adjacent computer than to the lock itself
solid product at a more than reasonable price .
used for laptop at senior center so could leave with it
it was easy to install on laptop and put thru cable hole on desk for security of the laptop .
i bought this cord to deter people from waltzing off with my work laptop
it feels and looks good and sturdy , and doesn not have any obvious glitches or defects , so it is doing there job well in that respect
it is a bit bulky , which works for my work computer ( which is ~1&<HASHTAG> ; thick at the hinge ) , but it wouldn not be suitable for my newer ultrabook .
i am using this lock with a relatively new hp pavilion laptop , and it seems to be a very nice product for what it is intended to do -- protect your computer in reasonably secure areas
as others have said , it won not stop a bolt cutter , and it could probably be picked given enough time
but in an environment like an office or restaurant , it should be fine
the cable is flexible , and nicely coated so that it doesn not scuff surfaces
the lock mechanism itself works smoothly and seems quite sturdy , and it hasn not scuffed or scratched the laptop even after numerous uses
the only real concern i see : the lock mechanism is significantly bigger in diameter than older locks i have used ; so if there is some other connector very close to the security slot on your laptop , you may not be able to use the lock and the connector at the same time .
i admit i don not take this everywhere- i only have it for when i really need it , but in those cases , it works like it should
i use it for my macbook pro 13' ( 2009 , and i am pretty happy with it .
i really love this kensington lock
it just snaps right in
no little plug for the whole is necessary
the part that locks into the whole is built onto the end of the cable
it took me a few minutes to figure out that i had to use the key to attach the lock to the lap top but once i figured out how to use it , it is a very quick lock or
( i could have read the directions but where is the fun in that
i do a lot of working travel and i am always wary when i have to leave my laptop in the hotel room
a friend of mine had his stolen from the hotel room and the hotel took no responsibility for the loss
from that moment i decide that i needed a product with excellent reputation so after a good research over the internet i chose the kensington 64068f microsaver notebook lock and security cable
of course a thief is a thief but if someone attempts to steal my laptop for sure they are going to have to carry the big desk from the hotel room together !
it does just what it says it will do : if your pc has a locking slot ( almost all do now ) and the place where you are working has a secure piece of hardware to secure it the cable ( schools , libraries , airports , et
) , all casual thieves will move on
as for more determined thieves , that is perhaps another story
back up your data !
the lock arrived early and did what it is suppose to do
it is easy to install and comes with a velcro strip to wrap up the cord when not in use
good overall product .
the product is great
the chinese who put it together are probably great too
but the service doesn not exist
the frame is set back too far from the edge on my new dell inspiron
i don not know - if i was marketing this i would try to find out what pc is it worked on and make a couple drop down lists on the webpage so you could find out , without having to order it , pull it out of the package , see that it doesn not work , try to get it back in the package , buy a roll of tape , pay over half the cost to send it back , and then get know notification that it was received and no notification when it supposedly gets credited back into my account
when you send it back they have you download two forms
each form is the same and contains both forms
if i wanted to see how angry i could make people , i'd quit my job and go work for them
i would say that qualifies as service .
it won not stop somebody with the right cutting tool , but deters random theft when attached
good product .
it works on my imac 27&<HASHTAG> ; , but the directions didn not help
it would seem intuitive to just shove it in the computer is rectangular hole made for the lock
it did , though , require a lot of fidgeting to get it inserted
i had to hold the barrel from spinning and insert the lock at the same time
very frustrating
but , it is on now .
so it took me a few minutes to figure out how to line up the little pins and the head thingy
once i had that under control , this works just fine
inserts and removes easily and the cord doesn not get in the way
just goes about its business and does what it is supposed to do .
shipping was quick and packaging was very adequate for the product
the lock and cable appear to be of good quality
the keys work flawlessly and i prefer over the combination lock models
it was listed and purchased as a used item , but looks new and at half the cost of the new ones
how much abuse can a lock like this take ? i have always had good success with purchasing used items through amazon
if there is ever a problem , it is accepted back immediately .
durable comes to mind when receiving this product
easy to install and uninstall
for the price a most have , and a great buy .
works as advertised
the lock can seem a bit finicky until you learn how to lock it right
it works great .
i bought <NUM> of these this year , i guess out of habit
they seem a bit loose where they plug to the slot , but maybe that is normal
it didn not keep me from buying <NUM> more of them .
i have been using one of these for a few years and just bought another one for my brother
it is more of a theft deterrent than a theft prevention product
if somebody really wanted to cut the cable or rip the lock out , i am sure they could
but , it would be easier just steal the laptop right next to it with no lock
that is the reason i use it .
as the picture shows , you loop the lock through a stable object then lock it to the laptop is security slot ( some notebooks won not have it , i have an dell inspiron which has it )
if you leave your notebook computer unattended and there is no one around a determined thief could just break it off of the security slot attached to the computer
it doesn not feel too stable there
they would have damaged good however
this prevents my notebook from being walked away with when i am at the library
its worth paying $30 to protect a $2000 toy .
it was easy to connect this to the laptop
no code to share or remember
if you know where the keys are , you also know who has access .
appears to be sturdy and function as intended
no issues
it will work with a targus pa400p defcon security baseplate ( but &<HASHTAG> ; threading the needle&<HASHTAG> ; is a bit tight ) .
i purchased the kensington 64068f computer cable and lock because i was familiar with the kensington brand
i have been very disappointed with this product , and its use with my hp pavilion dv6 laptop
the manner in which the key fit into the lock has always been a problem ; it has always been difficult to fit in and turn to lock it
i have used it about times until an internal part broke off rendering it inoperable
this means a product failure in less than a month
i am concluding that the design of the locking mechanism is faulty
it was not a good buy .
my product came packaged neatly in a clear plastic bag
comes with two keys with bright orange tags
and a paper manual with the code to replace your keys if you ever lose them
never got the link to the site to work , so codes were practically useless
the cable has two different ends
one end has a lock and attaches to your laptop and the other end is a loop
the end with the lock can swivel , so the lock revolves around the end if the cable ever gets tangled
i wrap the cable around the leg of my desk and pull it through the loop
this way , unless someone has a cable cutter or enough strength to rip the leg off the desk , they should not be able to steal the physical laptop
unless they were aiming for the hard drive , graphics card , or ddr3 ram ; that would be a different story
cable is almost no different than the heavy duty bicycle security cables
it has a diameter of roughly ~&<HASHTAG> ; <NUM> cm
so a decent cable cutter can cut the cable in half
this is only a simple way to ward off thieves in a very basic environment
better than nothing
&<HASHTAG> ; &<HASHTAG> ; &<HASHTAG> ; final thoughts&<HASHTAG> ; &<HASHTAG> ; &<HASHTAG> ; i only got this since i needed to use my laptop on my desk at my job , and i can not be bothered constantly locking my laptop in the cabinet every time i step away from the desk
keeps thieves from stealing your entire laptop
if they were aiming at the components of your laptop , all they need is a phillips screwdriver and plastic gloves
or if they had a good compact cable cutter , which nowadays are quite small
for ~$31 , not a bad deal
to me was better than a retractable cable as those are weaker and thinner
the long cable is good if i ever needed the extra length
fits in my asus 15
6 inch laptop and my acer <NUM> inch laptop
may recommend to others , i don not know how long it would keep thieves off my laptop but something is better than nothing
: d
this product does a great job of theft deterrent
i say theft deterrent because a determined thief with a pair of strong wire cutters could probably get through it
however this is the case with any
non the less , the cable itself is thick and high quality
the thicker design makes it both look and feel sturdier as well as more deterring to a thief than some other , thinner cables i have seen
its black plastic coating helps to make it more aesthetically pleasing and keep the metal from rubbing against my wooden desk
like many other cables this one uses a loop design as the anchor
while the thicker design is great for strength it lacks flexibility ( the only downfall of the entire product )
while this cable is capable of making sharp turns , it takes a lot of effort
if you have a sharp bend near the lock it could put a lot of torque on your computer
the actual lock is free to rotate to keep the cable from twisting
the lock uses a barrel key and comes with two copies , allowing me to keep one on my key chain and a spare in my safe ( additional keys can be order through kensington using the id number on the side of the keys , should you need them )
when deciding between cables , i decided on one with a key because i travel around a lot and wanted to be able to quickly lock and unlock my computer
overall , this is a great product
i currently only need one but should the need arise , i would certainly a second ! pros : - thick cable- long cable- aesthetically pleasing- two keyscons : - not very flexible
the track ball often slips by the sensors on the mouse , causing it to not pick up certain motions
there are better track ball mice out there .
i liked this mouse fine -- and the first time it went out on me in a relatively short amount of time i figured i would give it the benefit of the doubt and get another
the second one , also , lasted only a very short time ( less than <NUM> months )
then i got a third one , and this one started acting screwy within the first few months
it is awful
i can not believe they charge this much for something so lame
don not waste your money .
i did my homework , and though i knew this trackball was mechanical and rather an old model , i still thought that overall many people had been happy with it
i have used trackballs before to a limited extent , and my husband has the kensington optical trackball with the cool red glow , but i wanted something that would better match my mac
well , forget about that
the orbit got very difficult to manipulate very soon after use
i had cleaned it several times in the first week , and i am a clean freak where the area around my mac is concerned
i found that the tiny springs inside were very fragile and one was not really in the right place
after two weeks i sent this back to amazon
it is pretty , it should work better , but after thinking it over i ditched "matching" , went out to staples and tried the logitech marble mouse
it is a great fit for my hand , and now resides on my desk
the marble mouse is cheaper too , which is odd
if i hadn not wanted a trackball right away i would have bought it at amazon
your options aren not that great pricewise as far as trackballs go , which makes the marble mouse a really good deal , unless you are a power user of photo manipulation software or other specific apps which need many buttons programmed .
i ordered this and used it for <NUM> month , then it stopped working all together
i now am without a track ball .
and then it moves erratically , or will only go sideways
drives me nuts
i will get the expert mouse trackball
wish they had an optic one
quite seriously , i don not have to wear the carpal tunnel cuff now
i don not have to keep looking for room to move the mouse on my little typing area
i set the controls to &<HASHTAG> ; fast&<HASHTAG> ; and it just barely takes a tiny bit of fingertip action to get all the way across my screen
when i click both left and right buttons at the same time i can leap tall buildings at a single bound -- and have barbecued kryptonite for lunch
yes , this really is a seriously good computer tool and i strongly recommend you get one to save your wrists .
i went to the store and tried a lot of these ; this is the most comfortable one to me
plug & play
easy to use
ps2 or usb .
it is not the best mouse but you get used to it .
bleck , bleck , bleck ! don not let this trackball sour you from the concept
trackballs themselves are much better and much easier on your hands , wrists , and arms then regular mice , but this one is a real stinker
first off , it is far too heavy
the ball is mechanical , not optical , so it makes for slow , plodding , difficult motions
it is a chore to push your cursor across the screen and it really causes a lot of fatigue in your hands and fingers
secondly , it is just not as comfortable as other , similar designed trackballs like the much easier and optical marble mouse by logitech
this one is just too wide in the base for me and the buttons were too far stretched apart
there wasn not any natural &quot ; drapping&quot ; of the hand on this design
thirdly , it is way overpriced
for ten dollars less you can get an optical trackball which will give you a lot more percision with a lot less effort
for those who like this style , i highly recommend you opt for the logitech marble mouse
at about $20 , it is a much better value
i used one for about five years and noticed a great reduction in wrist pain
for those wanting more options ( such as scroll wheels and such ) , i would suggest the very well designed logitech cordless optical trackman
it is what i upgraded to after using the marble mouse for so many years
it does require a slight change in position of hand , but it stays away from those horridly uncomfortable designs you see ; you still use your fingers to roll the main ball around
do yourself a favor and get a trackball
just make sure it is an optical one instead of a mechanical one
you will really be thankful you did and you will notice improvement and relief from wrist/hand/arm pain .
i now buy nothing but kensington mice and trackballs
they are built well and have superior drivers
the orbit is a great entry level trackball i got for my son is mac mini
i use expert mice on my three macs ( 1 home , <NUM> at work )
the orbit gets <NUM> stars only because the kensington expert mouse is so much better
add in a no questions asked <NUM> year warranty and you have no worries
my only complaint about kensington ? no bluetooth yet .
this was a good starter card for watching television through my computer
it worked well with windows 98 , but if you were thinking of using it with any operating system released this century , you'd find yourself out of luck
initially , with 98 , i thought very highly of the tv wonder
however , upon upgrading to windows 2000 , i had to download extra drivers from ati which ended up locking up the computer after watching tv for more than a few minutes
after that , i thought xp would handle it a little better
unfortunately , it was worse
i couldn not find any software support from ati that would with windows xp , and have yet to
in retrospect , i probably should have gone with the tv wonder ve which is compatible with windows xp after downloading an updated driver from ati is site .
i have probably invested more than ten hours into getting this thing to work
windows will always open an explorer window on an ati directory every time you start the os and you have to use regedit to put quotes around the multimedia software directory paths
also , i had it working for several months until i purchased a digital camcorder
installing the camcorder drivers disabled the tv tuner and no amound of could get it to work again
ati support has not been any help
"googleing" the web and newsgroups has revealed that the ati tv wonder is a nightmare for many people .
i think this is a good product if you plan to use it as intended
those that have incompatible graphics cards will run into serious problems , but otherwise this is a great product that gets the job done .
what happens , is that pci tv cards clog up your pci bus bandwidth , slowing down the computer while the viewer is on , especilly on a older computer with a pci / video card
you are also not able to have the tv viewer on while playing games with either pci or agp video card
if a scheduled show brings up the tv while you are playing a game , the game , ati player ( most common ) , both , or the whole computer will crash ! this doesn not get a <NUM> rating , because of the great software features
still and motion video capture is awesome
the scheduler is great , though useless to gamers with this particlular card ( see above )
ati tv cards are better than the other tv cards out there when it comes to the features
it is better than microsoft webtv too built into windows <NUM> also
just get with the amc ribbon cable connector if you have an older computer ( ati pro turbo , expression , rageii+ or older video card ) , or the new ati wonder ( radeon is newest ) if you have a newer one
just don not get this card ( ) or any other pci bus tv card
if you have a video card , then you are stuck with this card , as it is compatible with cards , but and the require ati graphics
but in any case , there is no integrated solution for gaming as of yet ( ati video cards are not good enough for serious 3d gaming ) unless you can get a card system running .
i purchased the lower end version of this product , the tv wonder ve
it has met all my needs in a tv tuner card to go in the pci slot of my emachine
my emachine did come with a ati video card , so i think that made it really easy
it also accepts composite input , something i haven not tried yet
had a minor audio issue with this product
called support , got a stupid person once , helpful person the next time i called
overall good product , i assume the regular more expensive product is even better .
this card may be fine for just watching tv on your pc , but for video capturing , the quality is horrible
you cannot capture above <NUM> pixels , and this severely limits the card in my opinion
i was expecting 480x480 capture ability ( which is present in their much much older product , the ati
over <NUM> years old ! ) , but did not find any
add on to that the fact that the mpeg1/mpeg2 encoding is done through software ( not hardware ) , and horribly at that
the card just isn not worth the price tag
perhaps the only good part about this product was that the install went smoothly
well , kind of
the package doesn not contain software for windows 2000
you have to go to ati is website and download beta software/drivers
it takes about <NUM> reboots to get the card installed completely in windows 2000
no biggie
if you want a decent capture card , either get an ati radeon , or wait for nvidia is new &quot ; personal cinema&quot ; to come out ( supports everything the aiw does , plus it has a remote , and you can view both tv/vga at the same time ! ) i think i will just save up my money and get a sony dv &lt ; -&gt ; analog converter box
now that is quality .
i am very happy with the speakers they are great
they are not the loudest out there but it is amazing that they are as loud as they are considering the satelites fit in the palm of your hand
my only complaint is that yamaha was offering a rebate when i bought these speakers and i sent in all the nessecary stuff , reciept , rebate form and the upc from the box
then i got a postcard from yamaha saying that they needed the upc
and since i sent them the original i was out of luck .
what wonderful speakers these are ! i read the reviews here on amazon and decided to use my gift certificates ( courtesy of echo
com ) towards these speakers
i admit , when i pulled them out of the box they looked awfully weenie
after pluggin' them in and firing up good old winamp , their quality blew me away
the human voice sounds so convincing through the <NUM> inch satellite speakers , and the subwoofer compliments them perfectly
unlike other systems i have heard , the sub &quot ; knows&quot ; when not to broadcast- the resulting response is amazing
my only qualms about ordering this system is that its packing weight- <NUM> lbs- carries a corresponding shipping cost of a little over <NUM> bucks
well worth it but something to consider when figuring the final cost
i'd recommend this system to anybody ! check it out !
i used this speaker set for more than half a year now , and it served me great
the sound quality is good ( don not expect quality sound , of course )
the is sounds great , too
at the back it can accept <NUM> line input , so i can connect my <NUM> pc to the same box w/o problem
generally , it is a very good computer speaker .
i bought these speakers to complement my macintosh/linux machine
for my purposes ( watching dvd is , listening to mp3 is , and general fooling around ) , they are perfect
the price is simply unreal for the quality these speakers have
look elsewhere for speakers to replace your stereo , however
these are thirty watt speakers
you arent going to find punchy bass for the likes of , rap , and other music
these speakers provide rich , clear sound at normal to loudish levels ( fills my house ! )
i would give them a 4
5 out of five stars , but i wasnt able to
i wholly recommend these to anyone who is looking for speakers for their computer .
i have this set , cost me 69
99 b4 rebate , once i set up and play on my cd walkman first , yes ! this is a good set for the price , deep , no boomy bass , clear mid and treble , but somehow the sounds a little bit awfulthis set is much better than any set i had till i got jvc desktop stereo+sony woofer , then i gave away , and they says this speaker set sounds very good
i used to have a lot of respect for teac products , but some years back they took the consumer electronics route and it is been downhill ever since
that said , this is a decent machine , and i enjoyed it during its short life
shortly after my warranty expired ( of course ) , i accidentally bumped the cd tray when it was open one day , knocking the gears and everything out of whack , and it was all over
never could get the tray to go back in right or the cd door to stay closed
the unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet
handle with care !
as the author of the jefferson airplane book "take me to a circus tent" and a former radio ( that worked in several electronic stores ) , i am often asked to write and or discuss various audio products and recordings from the 60 is and 70 is
teac ad500 combination cd/cassette deckif you are looking for a very good unit that will play both cd is and tapes , this is a wise choice
teac has a strong reputation and quality for those that don not see the justification for spending more then 215
00 to 225
there are a couple of terrific features included in this unit
the headphone jack has a volume control and the tape deck has pitch control
if you have ever found a tape sounding too fast or a bit on the slow side , you can adjust the pitch for normal playback
the entire ad500 is under twelve pounds
as always try to use quality tapes such as maxell or tdk for the cassette portion and please keep the tape heads clean or it circumvents the idea of a nice investment
dirty heads will give the playback muddy results

i use it to convert old tapes to cd ( via computer ) , as well as playing cds and cassettes on it
having the two media in one unit is a real space saver and convenient , too
the mechanicals and sound performance are excellent
headphones port with its own vol
contol a nice feature
thanks , teac .
we are dinosaurs that still have come cassette tapes we like to listen to ( and good luck finding a cheapo deck to use with a higher end stereo system ) this little gem combines a single cd with cassette
i like the auto repeat function
the size and price and combo unit had great appeal
never used the remote , so don not know
easy to "install" and use right away - no complex hookup needed
i don not have any complaints about the sound quality or functionality of this unit .
let me start by saying that when i scanned all of my cds in to itunes to work with my ipod and iphone , i deliberated long and hard about the compression rate i would use , and i finally settled on aac with explicit stereo , because i really could tell the difference between various setting after comparing them with carefully chosen songs
and i do regret a bit not having done apple lossless format now
by this i am trying to say i have sensitive ears
i was so looking forward to the teac to solve all my problems
( 1 ) i really wanted to be able to control cassettes with a remote control and ( 2 ) i wanted a "real" cd player that functioned as such , instead of using a dvd player to play cds , which is slower and inconvenient--the track number is not displayed , the "screen saver" often engages so you have to hit buttons more than once after a time , etc
the first thing i did when i unpacked the teac was to set it up and attached it to my tuner so that i compare it against my existing equipment
the cassette player was the most disappointing
i currently have a pioneer , which remains the best sounding cassette player i have ever encountered or read about online ( that has a reasonable cost )
i chose two cassettes to compare mainly because i new that the magnetic tape in them was in excellent condition and has great sound quality
these were "the dealer" by chico hamilton and "introspective" by the pet shop boys
i tried both with speakers and with headphones
the teac sounded pretty good , i must admit
however , when you compare it against my current pioneer , it paled in comparison
the pioneer had far greater treble response , yielding a far more vibrant and crisp sound
there was also a far greater "depth" with the pioneer--that feeling that you can reach into the sound to touch the individual instruments
i should say that i had dolby noise reduction off on both units
i mean , the teac does sound far better than my two sony cassette walkmen
however , the promise of a remote control was not enough for fogive the lesser sound quality
the cd section of the teac is less dissapointing
i was comparing it to a sony
the similarity was much closer here
however , i have to say that the sony came out slightly ahead of the teac
the tonal quality of the reproduction was a bit richer and the highs were a bit more crisp
this might boil down more to a matter of personal preference rather than absolute superiority
so , alas , i am going to return this unit and limp a long with the functional deficiencies in my current equipment in exchange for better sound quality .
hard to find a cd / cassette deck combination in this day
seems to be the best price for the unit .
as the author of the jefferson airplane book "take me to a circus tent" and a former radio ( that worked in several electronic stores ) , i am often asked to write and or discuss various audio products and recordings from the 60 is and 70 is
teac dual cassettethe teac unit gives you the ability to play on both portions of the deck and record on one
although you may be tempted to use high speed dubbing , take the extra time and record in the normal mode
very few decks ( especially in the price range of 100
00 ) were able to offer trouble free dubbing
the old saying you get what you pay for is realistic
the construction is not made for heavy use on a daily basis and you need to operate the controls with care and not reckless abandon
if you take it easy on the controls and use but don not abuse , for the price you will be satisfied
as always try to use quality tapes such as maxell or tdk for the cassette portion and please keep the tape heads clean or it circumvents the idea of a nice investment
dirty heads will give the playback muddy results

i bought this to transfer old cassettes to disc
it has been a wonder to work with
i have found nothing that doesn not work beyond expectations
with the i just start it up and copy the whole tape to pc in no time at all
playback on the cassette deck is great .
at first blush , this unit looks promising ( keeping in mind that one shouldn not expect miracles given the selling price , etc
one of the cassette mechanisms on this particular teac developed a loud electronic hum ( which had also translated to the recording as well as the playback mode ) after only <NUM> weeks of extremely light use - a virtual failure
i returned the item for a replacement ( ever the optimist or simply too stupid to know better ) and am awaiting the new unit
i must add that , unfortunately , my experience with teac products has always been disappointing at best ( at present , i have <NUM> teac products and all suffer from a malfunction of some sort on at least one of the features )
i actually purchased this to "replace" ( via aux ) the suddenly cassete decks on my teac compact system ( rather than trash the whole system )
those just quit
these failures seem to happen too regularly to attribute to a series of coincidences
just saying "beware" , i suppose
sometimes a bargain isn not always a bargain .
great if you need this to type of unit and still play your old cassettes
also useful if you want to transfer your cassettes to cds or dvds .
after owning a teac tape recorder since <NUM> that i was very happy with , i wanted a second one so i purchased this unit
what a dissapointment
it cliked and clanked when the tape engaged
it didn not have a earphone jack--my fault , i should have looked closer
after a couple weeks of use it wouldn not accept the audio feed in order to record so i returned it .
nice controls , a solid chassis , easy to use remote
the standout feature for me is that the transport is absolutely silent when playing---no hiss or hum from the motors ( i mean if you put your ear up to the component itself---not the lack of noise on the audio outputs , which should be a given with any but the cheapest disc player )
the algorithms are excellent---i played some badly scratched cds that other players could not handle and could barely hear the data interpolation at the scratch points
i would give it five stars but for two things--- ( 1 ) occasional speaker pop on ( easily resolved if you use a delay circuit or just turn your power amp/receiver on last when powering up your system ) , and ( 2 ) limited programming/playback options---there doesn not seem to be any way to set the unit to play just a single cd straight through ( without creating a program containing all the tracks of that cd )
the internal dac is not bad , and of course the optical output lets you hook up your dac of choice
bottom line , this is a great bargain in red book changers , well worth searching out used or as a liquidation special since it seems to have been discontinued and not replaced with an improved model ( what is jvc thinking ? ) .
bought this unit based on reviews listed here--have not been disappointed
nice unit , easy to use and of seemingly good quality
happy customer !
cd changers are getting very hard to find at a good price
i really like this jvc changer
it replaces a three or four year old fairly high end sony changer that started skipping the first <NUM> seconds of every disc
the changer is connected to a yamaha receiver via a fiber optic connector ( the same path as the sony changer )
i was very surprised at how much better cd is sound on this player
i am totaly sold
my guess , you can spend a lot more money , and not be any happier
one downside to this changer , it is tall
but i will take tall with good sounding solid mechanicals to short and cheap sounding .
after having read all the glowing reviews i purchased this item and was not disappointed
this is a very nice full quality function cd player
i have been very pleased with this item and its performance .
many people will tell you that you can not tell one cd player or cd changer from another as far as sound
well it seems as though i can and this jvc machine has the best specs in it is price range
i listen to everything from rock to classical and the reproduction of this machine is second to none
there are more "advanced" cd changers that cost two or even three times as much and yet they don not come close to the sound of this cd changer
i guess i am bad talking about the features of this machine
so i will leave that up to somebody else
i will say that you can load three cds at one time which is more than most cd changers
i just like it for the meat and potatoes of the basics of sound reproduction
edit : right now i am a man with two stereos
i know that i should be so lucky
this jvc is with my old "a" system
i have owned this model or the <NUM> just below it a few times before
my last jvc <NUM> lasted only <NUM> months before starting to skip uncontrollably
i have had durability problems with this model even though as i have said it has the best specs in it is class
when not owning the jvc i have owned a harmon kardon which sounded superior , but costed more , and broke after only <NUM> months
i have also owned sony is both the budget , mid , and models and have various problems from not being satified with the sound to not being able to play copies or mp3 is
currently my "b" system has a yamaha <NUM> which has great specs , but is more expensive
i hope the yamaha will be more durable .
i have had this unit for a little over a year , using it infrequently
it started having problems playing some tracks on even new cds , and now it won not play anything .
if you want a changer drive/player for your home ( separate component ) stereo system , this is a good choice
mine works flawlessly and has good sound qualities
it closely matches my older ( ) rcvr/amp unit in size and looks
it is not portable though and takes up a fair amount of cabinet space but for the money , this is a good deal imho .
this is my second jvc cd changer , i gave the first one i purchased five years ago to my mother and it is still working like a champ
this player has excellent sound and the controls on the front panel and on the remote are well laid out
the disk exchange feature is nice , you can leave one disk playing while you swap the others
the only downside to this player is on the programming , you cannot add tracks to a program once it is entered , doing so stops the program and you have to start over again
this is mostly annoying when you are recording to md or tape and realize that you have forgotten a song .
i don not understand all the negative reviews about this changer
i have owned this changer for about <NUM> months now , and find it more than suitable for casual use
my previous <NUM> disc changer was a kenwood ( purchased in 1998 ) ; i also own a pioneer <NUM> disc changer
before purchasing this changer , i was quite apprehensive due to the negative reviews on here
i bit the bullet , as my kenwood changer was acting up , and i am quite happy with this product
this changer has never skipped on me or presented other issues
i use the optical output on the changer to connect to my receiver , and the quality is excellent
the remote works even with sloppy angles
the changer is quiet when changing cds ( rotating the carousel ) , and the display is readable from across the room
there are a few little quirks : the changer differentiates between 'exchanging' a cd ( thus not interrupting the currently playing cd , and not opening the drawer all the way ) and 'open' , which stops the current cd and opens the drawer
personally , i find the distinction a little annoying , since i almost always want to 'exchange'
my previous kenwood has no such distinction
i also wish the remote layout and buttons were a little more friendly to use by touch and not by sight--i like to listen to music in low light or even darkness , so i had to memorize some of the remote buttons ( in particular , 'disc skip' is located in the middle of the remote )
however , these are extremely minor nits
the changer is excellent , feels sturdy , and has survived about <NUM> hours of use in the last <NUM> months
i am delighted with my purchase and would recommend the changer to anyone looking for a low capacity changer .
i am pleased with this cd player , after searching thru best buy and circuit city it was a welcome relief to find a product i really wanted .
sound quality is excellent for the price and it is very easy to use ; i highly recommend this player .
i love this changer , it does everything i want it to do
it can do random playing as well as straight forward and continuous play which means i can listen to a variety of music for hours .
i have had this changer for approximately <NUM> weeks , past the amazon <NUM> day return policy , unless stocking charges and shipping costs are paid by me
jvc will not exchange the unit but will repair it at their local authorized dealer
at first , there were seldom , random skips , garbles , and lyric repeats
these have become more frequent and annoying
pristine discs made no difference and changing the optical cable did not help
my ten year old yamaha changer , it has drawer problems , plays my discs flawlessly
so far , this is the only problem but a major one that is getting worse
everything else is working and i do like the unit
the sound quality is superior to my old yamaha and the remote is better
i do not know if this unit can be fixed or , like with cars , the repair people cannot duplicate the problem
i am not going to put a lot of time , energy , or gas into getting this changer repaired beyond my first attempt
maybe dvd changers are made better and i can use one as a cd player ? i am disappointed , to say the least , and from my experience , i know purchasing electronic components can be a gamble
i hope your purchase goes better
update : 1/21/09i took the unit in for warranty repair
they replaced the laser and on the technician is equipment , both analog and optical cable connections were tested , the unit played flawlessly
on my home system with a new optical cable , i again had the original problems
i gave the unit to a friend and it works perfectly on his sytem using the analog connection
it must be a hand shake issue with my equipment so i no longer believe it is the unit itself
i have read that some electronic equipment combinations do not always work well together
i conclude that was my situation .
i wasn not referring totj wisemen rcfm222 remote controlled fart machine no
2i mean , some times a dry cleaner works better than a wet one
often i will do a dry one , then follow it up with a wet one likemaxell vhs wet cleaneri wouldn not recommend a wet one followed by a dry one
that might bind you all up orsomething
i hate it when my stuff gets all bound up and it requires being opened up bya professional
i hope i have layed/laid
put all the options on the table
buy these before they gothe way of
vcrs ! thank you !
it seems to work fine , if you are having issues with your vcr playback and recording quality , this is the answer .
my fiancee and i have many , many , vhs and dvd movies
here vhs player started messing up , so we went to store after store looking for a cleaning tape
finally ordered two cleaning tapes online
both work great .
i have a temperamental dvd player
i ordered this dry head cleaner , because it is so temperamental about what we use in it .
just as advertised
arrived quickly
seems to have fixed the tracking problem on a veryold vcr with many hours use .
this is very convenient to use but the wet cleaner works better
simple to use and can be used multiple times .
the tape video head cleaner works as expected
very good product
i recommend it for those who want to keep their old vhs equipment .
bought <NUM> of these thinking they'd be be similar to traditional head cleaning tapes that might play for <NUM> minutes before a rewind is required
these dogs run maybe <NUM> seconds giving a possible <NUM> supposed cleanings before rewind
the 'cleaning tape' doesn not appear any different than 'video tape' and any improvement in video playback was mostly imagined
went back to using a <NUM> year old cleaning tape
this product is a dog dog dog and stink you will stir up after stepping in this turd hangs around for weeks .
put this tape and just push play and it cleans your vcr
my tv/vcr combo is an old model that i found free on the road side which had a fuzzy playback mode and and the voice was almost nonexistent
after playing the tape twice i now have a crystal clear picture and a normal voice on the vcr playback !
i just can not fathom how a dry tape can clean all that well
i also wonder how this can clean the record heads being that it never has you press the record button ( probably doesn not clean the record heads is my guess ) however it is by far the simplest to use ! even my mom could do it ! that is got to be worth something
i think i will give it to my mom !
i am writing this review at the urging of amazon
com , but it is really a bit early
i bought a couple of maxell vp100 dry video head cleaners because i planned to copy a lot of old vhs tapes to dvd on my new vcr/dvd recorder
i have successfully used it about five times total on three vcrs
in the last attempts , when i inserted the cartridge , it immediately started rewinding , and i had to stop it and hit play
it doesn not always play
this has happened on two vcrs
the jury is still out on this product
i think i am supposed to get about <NUM> uses
i will come back and edit my review if i have any new information .
most of us have old vhs tapes in the closet and the keeps your vcr delievering a clean image
what more can i say---it works !
this are so useless they dont clean the vcr perfectly and you can clean a vcr yourself for free ! the only reason you should use this is if you have one of those tv vcr combos those you cannot clean yourself
i have always used wet system vhs head cleaner cassettes since i can remember , but i have found the maxell vhs dry tape video head cleaner to work just fine
generally , if you use a higher grade tape for home recording you are not going to run into problems
in fact playing a high quality tape through your machine will actually clean your tape heads
most times when problems develop is when you rent tapes or play budget tapes in your vcr
you may notice picture deterioration or even loss of picture , sound and tracking by playing contaminated tapes or tapes of an inferior quality where the oxide gets transferred to your video heads , linear audio heads , rollers and guides
in these instances wet system vhs head cleaner cassettes have always corrected the problem for me , but i have found that this maxell dry head cleaner corrects those issues just as efficiently and completely
this maxell vhs dry tape video head cleaner really does work and you can maintain your unit and fix the problem on your own
i have found that for best performance , it is best to use dry head cleaners as part of a routine maintenance of your vhs player/recorder
this allows you to stop build oxide up before it becomes a major problem
i have not had to use a wet cleaner in over <NUM> years now .
this product is made in china and runs for ten seconds one cycle at a time with automatic rewind and no sound or video accompanying
this product is not like the previous head cleaner which had four cycles of aproximately two minutes each with a sound and video format
i liked the original product much , much better - not happy
try to find maxell sku : 290058 , upc : 025215290053 , to see if it does the job .
i use my vcr for high quality audio recordings
this cleaner does a great job of cleaning up the slight noise i get when tape heads start to get dirty
highly recommended .
terrible product
the older version ( with the same model number ) was excellentall this one does is jam in the machine
no cleaning video , no cleaningbuzzes for a few seconds and jams
i bought 2 , both had exact same problem .
like several other reviewers , the product ruined the picture
i read some comments on other negative reviews and can say that there were no other variables at play in my case
there appears to be very poor quality control on these and buyer beware
the product i received destroyed the picture and i am hoping another product will be able to fix the vcr
addendum : another head cleaner returned the picture except for color distortion in one stripe .
i put the tape in and it immediately turned off my vcr and ejected the tape
i tried again and the same thing happened
i tried it in another vcr and the same thing happened
amazon gave me a full refund .
i use both a wet and dry vhs head cleaner so this product goes well with the maxell wet head cleaner .
amazon is sending a replacement
unfortunately mine arrived damaged and i had to return it
they say dry tape head cleaner is are better than wet
maxwell has been in vhs and cassettes for awhile so i imagine it will be worth the investment
i am hoping to download my video collection on dvd
so it will get much use !
this is an absolutely amazing product
twice it has made a vcr that is at least <NUM> years old go from unusable to working like a charm
it has certainly kept us from throwing out our vcr
i definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to get more life out of their vcr .
this product i am sure works in some cases but in the case of my vhs cleaning job , it did not work
it did improve the picture but did not completely fix the picture
i gave it <NUM> stars rather than one star because i don not know if a wet vhs head cleaner would have done the job better and i made a poor selection or if the vhs is failing in a different way .
it sort of works
it worked in one vcr fine
i didn not seem to work in the other one
iffy .
it works clean and prefect
what else can be said but get it .
this item arrived on time and in good condition
i have several vhs players , and this is a must for me
very easy to use to get great results without having to open up the vhs unit to clean it , though i still do once in a while just to visually check the bands
this works as good as the wet type head cleaner , but without the hassle of adding drops into the head cleaner tape
i recommend this head cleaner
i give this a <NUM> star rating because this is the simpliest way to clean the video and audio heads of a vhs .
there is no question that maxell has made the best of cleaners for your electronics
they have definitely done it for years , with accessories , and continue to do so
while many people have stopped owning vcr is , there are some that still do after all these years , and maxell is still making those aids for it
this maxell dry tape head cleaner handles very well , and works in a instant
it is very easy to read and understand , and should not die down
it will last around <NUM> times for use in your vcr , and definitely is worth the money
while , it can take a bit out of you if you do overuse it , it should keep you vcr from any flaws for at least <NUM> years
i have always loved what maxell had made with their electronics accessories , and this should definitely be a great buy
price : bconvience & quality : b+overall : b 1/2+
i am giving this product a one star review because it did not work for me
i recently purchased theterratec g3 video digitizer with scart connector , usb 2
0 pc interface , pal , ntsc , secam video standards , for mac & windows
to convert all of my old vhs videos to digital format
this product hooks up to the video out of your vcr , interfaces with your computer through usb , and records
i no longer have my own vcr , so i had to borrow one from a friend
i wanted to use this cleaner to ensure my friends vcr would be in top shape for the conversion
keep in mind that for all intents and purposes , i have not touched a vhs or a vhs player practically since dvds became popular
with that said , i popped this cleaner in my vcr in about every way i could think of and could not get it to play
i tried to play it , rewind it , and fast forward
and then play it again
the reels would just not spin
luckily , the vcr my friend let me borrow was a ridiculously nice unit that was paired with his home theater setup when vhs was still widely used
it just did not need cleaning
i seem to remember that some vcrs may have been "
" i could just be making that up , but perhaps this cleaner will not work with a self cleaning vcr ? does anyone know anything about this ?
this is okay
but i prefer one that has a message that shows it is working
i still like to tape some shows and find it hard to find a cleaner that does have a message instead of just &<HASHTAG> ; noise&<HASHTAG> ; showing .
this is quickly becoming a very hard to get item since vcr is are now few and far between
this item is almost in stores
it does the job it was made for
you can not ask for anything more .
i have been digitizing a lot of family movies , videos , etc
, and it is very important that the vhs player i have been using has clean heads
we manually cleaned the heads when we started , but i purchased this to clean them intermittently during this very long process
the vhs player is running our tapes through very crisp and clear
i believe it is doing what it is supposed to do .
this is an excillent head cleaner
there are visual graphics on the tape that talk you through the process & you get a little chart that you can stick on the tape case which shows that you can get <NUM> uses out of it
then just toss it out & replace it
this cleaner really improves the a/v quality on a vcr .
i purchased this for a friend and they absolutely loved it
based upon that , i strongly support anyone is decision to give this product a try .
received the head cleaner on time
worked as expected , although the actual cleaning time was less than <NUM> seconds , as stated in the instructions .
i have had plenty of experience with vcrs over the years , inside and out
i have had to clean and repair plenty of them and occasionally used dry head cleaners for mild jobs
this thing is a piece of junk and doesn not clean anything
first of all , the box indicates the cleaner should be stopped after running for <NUM> seconds ( always check the instructions for anything regardless of how experienced you are
never let ego or testosterone get in the way , guys
use a little wisdom )
the only problem is there isn not <NUM> seconds worth of cleaner tape on the cassette
it runs for <NUM> seconds and stops
second , it is not good when you place one of these ( or a tape ) into the machine and you hear a loud electronic sounding 'grinding' noise
it happens whenever a tape has wrinkles in it and this thing did exactly that at the beginning each and every time i ran it through ( i checked the actual tape and nothing looked out of the ordinary )
i gave up after a bit to avoid any further problems
after running it a few times , it still did not do anything with the simplest of cleaning jobs
i can crack open the case and clean the heads by hand faster than this thing
clearly i will be looking for an alternative or simply taking care of the problem by hand
bottom line , useless .
i have a panasonic tv with built in vcr
vcr doesn not work and tapes were getting stuck
i thought/hoped this would do the trick
it didn not help
i will try to use it on my other vcrs
maybe they need some help before they go bad too .
i have <NUM> of these and neither one works in the <NUM> different vcrs i have
they make the screen worse
i then use my old style maxell cleaning tape to fix the picture ! how can i get the old style maxell vcr cleaner ?
i have an old vcr that was getting quite dirty and this did the trick at cleaning the heads
they are getting harder and harder to find but i am glad i finally found this one to purchase .
tried this in my sony , jvc , magnavox and panasonic vhs vcr is and it does not work properly on any of them
the cleaner tape stops at various periods of time and never completes a cleaning cycle
it is intermittent at best
don not wast your money .
man oh man , i stuck this sucker in really less than <NUM> sec is later it was done
so i thought nah nothing is ever going to clean my dirty heads of my old vhs player tv combo
but how wrong i was
as i did it again just to be sure
and less than <NUM> sec is later
done !
so either dry vhs cleaners are better than the wet type or i and i alone got a magic special cleaner for my tv/vhs combo .
i put this in my vcr and it turns off the vcr
i have tried everything
it runs vcr tapes fine , but when i put the maxell head cleaner cassette in , it turns the vcr off
then when i turn the vcr back on , it ejects the tape .
easy to use
i would recommend this product over other products
it was cheaper online than it was at the store .
i purchased this for my dvd/vcr converter combo
the product is working just fine
i haven not had an opportunity to use it a lot , but that is a good thing , right ?
never thought i'd be needing one of these again
in fact , what is a vcr ? anyway , my disney movies were crackly and the screen was fuzzy
ran this puppy through and they were like new again .
i don not know why these outdoor speakers were so cheap ; they replaced much larger speakers that eventually gave it up to the weather conditions , but the sound is even better
they are powered with a standard sonos receiver/amplifier unit , and still sound teriffic
in fact , i like them so much that i will probably take them down for the winter , to avoid having to replace them in a few years .
for the cheap cheap price , these speakers work as good as needed and sound decent
they do what they need to do and did i say they were cheap ? !
i bought these to mount under my deck for some outdoor tunes and they work great ! sure they don not have the deep bass that you might expect from expensive indoor speakers , but at this price they do they job perfectly
they have already been through several rain storms here in georgia and continue to work fine
highly recommended !
these speakers are great ! the have high quality sound and worked great for my computers external speakers
i love the quality when listening to my cd is
bought <NUM> pair for an outdoor screened porch for $30 per pair
they sound great , were easy to mount , and oh so inexpensive ! we have had some gatherings and the sound has been plenty and when sitting out quiet , it sounds great too
for the porch setup , i also purchased a stereo receiver ( sherwood ) for $85
my main goal was to allow radio play and to use an ipod as source for the screened porch
well , the sound is great ( nice lows and can even blast all the neighbors ) , the components were cheap ( except the ipod ) and i can feel okay leaving the receiver outdoors ( out of direct rain path , but definitely gets plenty of dust and humidity
we were moving and didn not want to leave the bose <NUM> speakers ( that i had installed in every room of our home
) i looked for speakers that were less expensive to leave in their place , and took a chance on these audio source ls <NUM> speakers based upon the reviews here in amazon
although the reviews were good , one doesn not expect "real" quality at this price
you cannot imagine our surprise at the quality of the sound these speakers reproduced ! they are not as spacial as the bose but their dynamic and acoustic range is excellent
like the bose they fall off rapidly below about 80hz but are very linear up to the audible limits
( if you want more bass add a
i bought these speakers for my pool deck ( i live in florida )
i mounted them to my walls using toggle bolts to attach the included brackets
these little speakers look great , and really have decent bass response considering their size
[it probably helped they were mounted in corners
]i am greatly disappointed by the rusting of the metal face , though
they have only been out for about six months and the mesh cover is already rusting
outdoor speakers should not have this issue - stainless or galvanized steel should have been used for the mesh and then painted
i would rate these four stars for sound , but only three because of the poor weathering .
i mounted them under my eaves and they work great
i thought because they were so cheap that the sound would be cheap , but they sound great and have worked fine after a few rain storms .
they do a good job
i put them below my deck and they have worked very wellfor two years
great sound
i would buy them again
great bargain for the price .
i bought these after reading reviews
i don not think they sound as good as some said they did
however i am satisfied with them for what i use them for , background music on patio
for the money i didn not expect bose quality .
dollar for dollar these are hard to beat ! every body was right about the brackets , they are a little weakly made
mine are mounted inside our camper in the upper corners of the bedroom and sound much better than the old ceiling speakers
will buy another pair for the living area to replace the other pair of ceiling speakers out there
are a nice size for space avaiable .
i have owned a pair of these speakers for several years
i have been and continued to be amazed at the sound quality these very cheap speakers provide
they are part of my budget "home theater" system in my bedroom , the other components being a 1970 is pioneer receiver , a five year old pioneer dvd player , and a samsung 16" crt tv
theater on a budget ! several years ago , i was taking some very nice used bookshelf speakers back to a store to trade them in on larger speakers
just for fun i wired one of these beautiful little wooden speakers to one channel of the pioneer receiver and one of these audio source speakers to the other channel
then i moved the balance from left to right and back a few times to see what the difference was in the sound
i was amazed to find i could not hear a significant difference in the sound ! anyway , i have enjoyed going to sleep to jazz on fm radio , and watching dvds with the sound coming through these speakers , for several years now
it makes me wonder if all the hype about expensive speakers and specs in the hi fi world is just a load of
well , you know .
for a cheap pair of outdoor speakers these sound better than the price warrants , and lasted longer than i expected .
sure these are not the worlds greatest speakers
yes the bass is a little low , but you are only paying thirty something dollars
for the price the speakers are amazing , they have some good volume before they distort and they have better bass than all the leading name brands that run one to two hundred dollars
i put a pair of inifinity outdoors in a side by side comparison and actually had better bass output from the audiosource
so i took the inifinity is back and had enough money to buy a <NUM> disc cd changer and money left over to buy an extra pairs of audiosource speakers for the garage and more on the deck
i would recommond these speakers to anyone who wants good sound quality outside at a cheap price
if you are looking for surround sound speakers , then look elsewhere .
i put this pair of speakers outside on the right side of my garage facing my backyard
and boy does it produce nice sound
i placed it up under the roofline so it would stay a little drier
i live in rainy houston , we have had <NUM> or <NUM> heavy rainstorms and the speakers are still working just fine
this pair was a great price , arrived very quickly , and sounds just fine
buy it and save money .
i bought this model because it was cheaper than the sparkplug model in white with an plug
well , the straightness of the plug couldn not withstand normal use , and the audio stopped working because the junction between the wire and the hard part of the plug probably got bent back and forth too much
good sound and , but not durable if you plan to move your mp3 player in and out of your pocket .
beautifully soft and comfortable , earphones , and the only ones i have ever found that don not keep falling out of my ears like earbuds do
good sound quality , and excellent price , with the superb koss reputation behind them .
great sound for the price
plus absolutely amazing sound isolation for traveling ! for $10 you get something that paying $100 wouldn not compete with
i have traveled with my friend and his high dollar bose noise canceling headphones and while those are more comfortable ( since the don not sit in the ear ) the isolation was just as good
mine wore out after a little over a year , so i mailed them back to koss since they have a lifetime warranty , and i got a new pair
can not beat that
only downside is that wearing them for hours and hours can cause your ear canals to be a little sore .
warranted for lifetime but <NUM> dollars return each ( even if shipped multiples ) for shipping plus whatever you pay to ship to them to repair facility
they can be shipped for <NUM> dollars or less ( no matter how many ) very easily so koss is definitely cheating us here
used to be <NUM> dollars and even then they charged individually for these tiny items but you could gain a little over this <NUM> dollar for new price
ear buds themselves are fairly good ( usually last me about <NUM> months ) when compared to how long most others last at this price and sound is also pretty good
they fit well and stay in good too .
the headphones look better than older koss sparkplug but the sound quality is much worse .
these are awesome
best $13 headphones i have ever heard , and they cut out the dull roar of trains/cars/computers/coworkers almost entirely ! i truly wonderful product , and amazon had them in my hands in <NUM> hours ! i am just so , so pleased
: - )
i have compared these ear buds to shure e2c is , ( $ ) , and creative zen auravana is , ( $ ) , and found them better than the shure is and almost as good as the auravana is in certain ways , and better in other ways , ( the bass on the auravana is is too thumping , and cable noise is worse than the koss )
they are just plain astounding - especially for the money
if you want to buy something that beats all three , get the creative is
incredible sound that just barely beats these little koss buds - but they are $50
for the money , the koss can not be beat , period .
i have owned <NUM> pairs of these , and they do provide o
sound quality for the price
however , i have since switched to another brand of headphones ( jvc marshmallow--love 'em ) due to several shortcomings of this product : - difficulty in acheiving optimum sound : you gotta have these positioned in your ear perfectly to get sound- cheap cord : it is too thin and flimsy , tangles too easily- cranial reverb : every bite you take or word you say ressonates through your skull in an unsettling way when you have these on- sound quality isn not really that great compared to the jvcsthere are better value choices out there ; i'd recommend skipping these .
ok , the deal is that i was looking for earbud headphones that i could wear while riding my motorcycle long distance on the highway
most earbuds are useless because at high speed the wind noise drowns out everything
in fact , wind noise is so bad that i normally have to wear earplugs
enter the koss earbuds
first , the sound
*great* sound , very accurate with excellent range
headphones aren not worth it if the sound does not satisfy
these *more than* satisfy
second , the applicability to the task
the earplugs supplied with the earbuds are darn good and will work for most applications
i decided that i wanted something even more custom , so i cut up some of my normal foam plugs and fitted them over the earphones
the result is excellent
even at <NUM> mph i get good sound with comfort and acceptable windnoise reduction
if you want absolute noise isolation plus sound , i recommend you get soft foam earplugs
drill out a hollow shaft through the center
to do this , heat up a 3/32&quot ; drill bit , force it through one end and then twist repeatedly to cut out a shaft
press the earplugs over the small tube on the earphone , then apply the earplugs according to the instructions on the earplug package
*purchasing note*i was suspicious of the circuit city pickup option , but tried it anyway
i was *very* pleased
circuit city confirmed the purchase within <NUM> minutes , and i picked up the headphones the same evening .
i tried the sure e2c is as an attempt to upgrade from my normal sennheiser mx500 is
the sures are sturdy , very inconvenient to use , and i couldnt get them to seal properly in my ears no matter how much fidgeting i did
so i bought the plug , another mx500 , and still saved at least <NUM> bucks over the sure productthe plug sounds terrific for the money
the sound isolation was good and they were easy to fit to your ear properly and produced a good all around sound revealing sounds absent when i use my sennheisers
the bass is more prominent but didnt seem out of balance
it was just easier to hear and a little muddy &lt ; what can you expect for <NUM> bucks ? >
i listen to a lot of rockin blues , and these are perfect because you can hear the typical basslines in a standard blues band group better
is the plug better than the sure which is far more expensive ? for me it is , but only because i could get the plug to seat properly in my ears and couldnt with the sure
i think the sure e2c is would sound awesome if they would fit properly , albeit lots more inconvenient to use .
i wanted to try these because i use my mp3 player in noisy environments , and they were supposed to be able to fit tightly into your ears and block the outside noise
well , i never was able to use them and finaly gave up on themn
i tried many times to squeeze the foam and hoped that they would mold to the shape of my ears , but it was never satisfactory
i found them very uncomfortable .
i kid you not
decided to splurge ( over $300 ) on a super set of earphones for my ipod from shure and hated them and sent them back
then i tried these as a temporary solution and found them actually vastly superior in sound , aesthetics and discrete form
i simply love them
as a frequent traveller , i appreciate not hearing the usual yada yada on the airplane
highly recommend them .
got my first pair around <NUM> years ago , loved them then and still love them now
they fit and seal well , block as much ambient noise as safety ear plugs , and they sound awesome to me
i use them with a sansa clip zip at work <NUM> hours a day <NUM> days a week and they are comfortable
they require less volume to be used than some competitors brands ( saving battery life ) to reach a desired level and will certainly go loud enough to make you deaf if you push them
using the sansa is equalizer allows me to adjust the levels to fit my music and tastes to a sweet sound
i listen to mostly hard rock , classic rock , country , and some blues and i find that while maybe they aren not audiophile quality they are really good for the price .
ok the first thing about this review
i have a pair of the 'new' the plug headphones
they are not the ones pictured here
they have no mute button and are metallic silver and purple in color not blue and yellow
apprently koss got a lot of feedback from the first version , they listened , and made a much better product
the ones i have are just fantastic
great bass , like the original , but very good mids and lows as well
they work better as isolation headphones then anything i have used before , but apprently people who are audiophiles are not that impressed
also they have fantastic volume ability
because they are in your ear canal i can turn my portable equipment up really loud
i don not but its nice if you want to
music sounds great with these headphones
frankly best headphones i have ever used , but i am using the new version not the blue and yellow ones pictured here
ok right now what to do ? i would call amazon and make sure you are getting the new version
i never used the one they have listed here but almost everywhere i looked on the net , people say the new version is much better .
upon determining that the ear pods included with my ipod were of inferior quality , i opted to have them replaced asap
i assessed my options while remaining conscious of my budget and planned usage of the product , and decided on the koss "the plug" ( or "spark plug" ) ear buds
my other option was the shure e2c model , as a friend owns these , and they sound phenominal
however , since i don not foresee myself using my ipod all that often , i didn not up my budget to accommodate these
these headphones are of the "ear bud" style , which basically means that a foam/malleable nub is inserted into the actual canal of your ear ( as opposed to ear pods , which snugly rest within the exterior of the canal
) an important thing to know about ear headphones is that they will not perform at their maximum ability if not properly inserted ! instructions are clearly printed on the back of the package , and if not followed , you will not get the best usage out of your product -- in fact , the sound quality very well may sound terrible
to properly insert these ear buds , the entire foam nub must be fully compressed ( via pinching and rolling with the fingers ) and immediately inserted into the ear canal
additionally , your best bet is to gently pull your ear canal open by gripping the top of your ear with your thumb and index finger while inserting
the ear buds then must be held in place ( without shoving them in deeper ) for approximately seconds , while the foam expands into your ear canal , forming a solid fit
if incorrectly inserted ( i
not inserted all the way , not compressing the foam prior to insertion , etc
) highs and lows will sound awful , even if you own a pair of $300 ear buds ( yes , they do exist
) simply put , if you look in the mirror with the ear buds inserted and you can only see the plastic ear pod outside of your ear , then you can pat yourself on the back for a job well done
with that out of the way , the sound output of these rather inexpensive koss ear buds is very impressive for the price
the frequency response ranges from <NUM> hz to <NUM> khz , which is nothing to smirk at
distortion is cleverly kept to a minimum at all volume levels except for the very loudest point ( i suggest breaking in your ear buds gently before hopping right in and destroying your ear drums
) the bass output is subtle and effective for the most part , but doesn not perform very well with certain genres of music ( while almost all electronic music sounds amazing , rock music or deep rap music may not produce the same satisfaction
) it should also be known that there literally is no headphone , or not , that perfectly reproduces all styles of music , and this applies to even the most expensive models
any given headphone device will excel in certain categories of sound reproduction , while performing less impressively in others
( can you tell i am an audiophile yet ? ) the few negativities to speak of are as follows
the cable , while a decent length ( not too short , not too long , ) feels rather fragile
additionally , the included foam polymer ear buds are on the large side , and may or may not cause some minor to severe discomfort after extended periods of use ( upwards of an hour
) thankfully , replacement ear buds can be purchased in multiple sizes at most electronics stores
overall , if you are finding yourself in the same boat i was and are looking for a suitable replacement for your disappointing ipod ear pods but don not want to break the bank , the koss "the plug" are highly recommended for the price
i haven not heard any other ear buds in this price range , but i can imagine that these are hard to beat for the money
just don not forget to properly insert them every time ! once you get the hang of it , they can be properly inserted and snug in your ears within <NUM> seconds
if you don not insert them correctly , they will not sound good at all , and you will have wasted your money ! i am a smoker , and even i hate wasting money ! so , educate yourself on headphones before buying any , and you won not be disappointed .
these plugs easily fall out regardless of what one of the three foam pieces you use
they are uncomfortable and hard to insert even if you follow the directions and suggestions here
i recommend the sony in earphones about $25
very comfortable
great tone and bass sounds
sound isolations is great ! they are very affordable and i definitely recommend these for anyone who is looking for a great buy .
these weren not as good as i'd hoped
when i put them in , it made my music too loud , the least thing they fell out , generally they did not work for me .
i found them uncomfortable for long use
i took the spongy parts off the ends and cut the tips off some other earplugs i have so the sound could travel through and that works well , only because it keeps the purple/silver part away from my ear cartillage
that part is rather large and they won not go far enough into my ear to stay there comfortably
they will work but my search isn not over .
this time i bought a new pair because my cat decided to play with the old pair
( these are not cat toys but how do you convey that to a cat that doesn not listen anyway ? ) the pair i bought before these was for a family member who still loves them and has given a pair as a gift to a few friends
when inserted correctly , these are better than the $200+ bose noise cancelling headphone and much cheaper
the sound quality is outstanding and the cable is durable
except when a cat plays with it
i do suggest you purchase the ear bud replacements as well since these can get a bit funky after being used for a while
also , make sure you purchase the correct ear buds
i learned the hard way that koss makes different buds for their headphones .
at this price point , you are not going to find a better pair of reasonably durable earbuds with this quality of sound or ability
i'd say that i have gone through a pair every few years , and i will continue to buy these as needed
they block some sound , the sound quality is fine , and you won not be devastated when you realize that you have forgotten them on the plane and need to buy a new pair .
i have two challenges which have made finding proper fitting ear buds problematic
first , my ear canals are a bit on the small side
( this issue does not transcend my ear canals but , i digress ) second ( ly ) , i am missing that little flap of skin that other people have on their ( misshapen ) ears that holds ear buds in place
despite these challenges , these things stay in place , are quite comfortable , and sound good in the bargain
if you are interested , there is also a wealth of information on the internets that explains how to modify these things to make them sound and fit even better
for now , i am plenty happy with what i got for my $12 .
i have tried almost every kind of headphone and somehow could never get ones to a
stay in my ears , b
not hurt my ears , c
keep the quality of sound from my ipod
i purchased these headphones for myself to use at the gym so i can keep them in my ears and the plastic won not hurt me after a bit of use ( like most do ) and my husband took them and fell in love with them
he used them all the time and had them with him camping and sadly lost them in his camp fire so we purchased each of us a pair the second time .
i like to tune everything else out and just hear my music when i listen to my music
these work perfectly
the fit will be different for different ears , i actually turn the foam around to stick the bigger side in first
once they seal , i get deep bass , clear music , and isolation from outside noise , so i don not have to listen to them as loud to get that "my own world" feeling
only drawback , they do wear out
i have gone through <NUM> sets in about <NUM> years , first set the foam wore out , replaced just the foam then the foam piece would keep falling out
second set , same thing
the third set is the only one that actually broke
i use them to work out , and one of the cables started to go , the one side would turn on and off depending on how you moved the cable
for the price , if they only last a year , it is still worth it
sound quality is great , isolation is great , and i have returned $100 set is that promised "amazing deep bass" that didn not even compare to the base i get with these .
the plugs feel like safety plugs and remove almost as much noise
when i put these on i was able to reduce my volume level in half ! i am now able to listen to my mp3 player while mowing the lawn
but the feel took a while to get used to
soft and spongy in my ear didn not feel right at first
great value for the price .
i have been using these buds for around a year now and have really enjoyed them
they greatly reduce ambient noise and decrease conversational noise immensely
i especially recommend these buds to those travelling in carpools or public transportation !
they do a nice job of isolating
they block out tons of noise
they can be a tad noisy when you chew .
overall i am very pleased with the plug headphones and i have been using them daily for over a month now
i purchased these headphones to replace the stock ipod headphones
i use my ipod almost exclusively for listening to podcasts while i do my morning walk and while i am driving to and from work
for that reason i didn not need high fidelity
what i was looking for was 1 ) a headphone that would block external noise and 2 ) stay in my ear 3 ) comfortably
4 ) good sound was important to me , but i am not that picky since i don not listen to a lot of music
here is how "the plug" fulfilled my criteria : 1
noise cancelling : <NUM> stars
if you take the time to compress the foam by rolling the foam between your fingers and get it inserted correctly you get almost no external noise
it acts almost like a regular ear plug
stay in my ear : <NUM> stars
again if you compress the foam and let it expand in the ear canal
if you don not it still stays in well , but not nearly as well as it does when it is compressed and allowed to expand
comfort : <NUM> and a half stars
the deduction is because the hard plastic part of the plug presses against a spot on my ear and causes just a little bit of a pressure point
everybody is ear is shaped different so your mileage may vary
i did try these with music and they do sound great
i have never had an expensive headphone so i can not give a comparison there
i really liked everything about the stock ipod headphones for my use except the ear bud itself
the foam covers kept coming off and they didn not stay in my ear very well during my walk
the plug headphone does remedy those problems
i am knocking off another because the plug headphones have a thin cord that gets tangled much easier than the apple headphones
this is probably common to any other "aftermarket" headphones though .
i purchased these portable headphones based on information in a review by an amazon customer
they are great
i replaced the earphones i received with my zen nano and i am so pleased
these are really superior to what came with my zen nano
they block out most of the outside sound and my cd recordings sound super
since i go to the gym every day , i love the fact that these "stay put" and allow me to do my daily routine
they can pretty much be molded by squeezing the eartips themselves and letting them expand when you put them in your ear
i would absolutely buy another set of koss plugs
> portable headphones are still going strong and i use them <NUM> days a week at the gym
i am so pleased , that when the time comes , i will definitely purchase koss again .
works fine as a basic set of earphones
however , the foam earplug doesn not quite fit right and pops out quite easily
instead , move on and look for a set with rubber "caps" that they often ship with different sizes - these fit better , stay put without fatiguing the ear .
if you want to go jogging or work out while listening to music , these headphones will stick in your ears like an earplug , staying put until you explicitly try to remove them
since they block out sound well and stick close to your eardrum , they can produce very powerful and clear sound despite their size
they hide pretty well
their foam piece is cheap online and easy to replace , which is important because they will wear out with all the squishing to make them fit in your ears
best of all , they are cheap
please keep in mind , though , that they pretty much function as earplugs
this can be a good thing and a bad thing
if you go jogging and fail to look both ways at roads , you may not notice a car approaching
however , if you want to be alone with your music and your thoughts ( such as if you are add ) then will serve you well .
i found these to be a waste of money and time
they didn not stay in my ears , i have very small ears , no matter how i tried i could not get them to fit properly , even the smallest cushion caused discomfort
the only thing they have going for them is that they are cute .
i had a older version of this headphone that had the angle plug on it
and they lasted for <NUM> years
these new ones have a straight plug and lasted only <NUM> weeks before i had to replace them
if they go back to the angle plug i will buy these again
if you look at the photo you see the angle plug they changed it to a straight plug .
no matter what sale or deal there is or how cheap it is , do not buy these earphones
i have purchased $8 headphones that were <NUM> times better
i would not want these for free
sound quality is crap
they are comfortable but that really doesn not matter if the sound is horrible .
sound is good from these cans , though not excellent
they do a fair job isolating outside noise , though quickly over time the foam stiffens on the earpieces
the audio quality is basically what i'd expect at this price point , so no real complaint there
but the cables are terrible
stiff and they transfer the noise of everything they touch
any slight movement that rubs against the wires translates that sound into your ears
if you want to sit perfectly still , that is not a problem
but terrible for the gym or most any other part of life that includes movement on your part .
these earphones sound quite good for the price
however , after owning two pairs over the last couple years & experimenting with them in every way i can think of , i cannot get them to stay inside my ears
you would need to have a very large ear canal to keep them secure & not popping out
koss gives you different size covers , but all of them do the same thing ; within a minute or two , these always pop out
the cord is also unnecessarily long
it is a shame , because they do sound quite good , and when they are in securely , they isolate noise around you , making it possible to hear a great deal of detail in music
i recommend you spend a bit more money & buy the shure e2c earhones , which give you a number of ear canal fittings , and which sound very much better .
apparently i have ears
normal buds will fall out easily
so i focused my research on buds that would hopefully stay in my ears without constant adjusting
onto the pros/cons : pros* block outside sounds out well
you can stick them in your ears a little for a little sound blocking , or really roll up the foam and deeply embed them into your ears for near silence
* the sound blocking really lends to the quality of the sound output since you hear more of the music and less of whatever else is going on around you
* produces a lot more sound output at the same volume
i attribute this to cancelling outside noise and channeling all the output right into your ears
does this benefit battery life since you are running reduced volume ? i'd think so , but probably not a noticable amount
* nice long cord
* seemingly good quality
* includes extra foamies
cons : * you have to sick them into your ear
some people probably would hate this
* they can block virtually all outside noise
someone could be axe murdering my family while i listen to music with these things and i'd never hear it
* if the cord gets tugged on or pulled it can transmit "noise" to your ears due to the fact the plugs are in your ear
this is minor but annoying and it happens to me somewhat frequently since i primarly use this with my shuffle in the gym
* i find the bass to be muddy
however , this is the case with every earbud i have used
consider the price of these it is a very minor complaint .
i have tried a lot of style headphones and have found these to be the most comfortable
a great value
sound quality is good , and the design of the "plugs" helps filter out noise
i found these to be great on an airplane , allowing me to relax to my music , while filtering out engine noise , conversations , etc
highly recommended
update : i still agree with everything i wrote in my original review , but i have gone through few of these now
after months , one of the ear buds goes dead or becomes intermittent
the wire seems to be worn or fatigued over time due to use , it is a cheap item , so maybe the price is still worth it
but just know that it may not be a very durable pair of earbuds .
excellent price for a non audiophile
for me , sound is great and isolation is too
nice snug fit
they tend to wiggle a but lose when i run so i use a headband to help hold them in
this works because they are so small and the headband doesn not make it feel like a vise .
these headphones work well and if used properly by gently rolling the foam then immediately inserting into ear , these will stay put and act similar to an ear plug allowing you to hear your music at a low volume level since they block outside noise .
they are very comfortable and fit nicely and securely in the ear canal
this fit is better than silicon earbuds
the sound quality i'd much better than any earbud in this price range .
i use these with my ipod nano while at the gym or doing yardwork
the ear piece helps keep out the sound of the lawn mower or chatty on their cell phones
these also have the deepest bass of any other earbuds i have tried -- too much for some , but those that like rock or metal should dig 'em
a couple things to note : a brand new set might have a few issues with falling out , but once the cushions are "broken in" they stay in the ear with no problems
also , the cushions occasionally soak up sweat and become soft and pinched in the ear
lastly , they are almost alway gross after use ! it takes a while to get used to the pressure in the ear , but i can not switch after getting used to these .
the only fault i could find with these is that the cord is too short
other than that , they are great .
sure these headphones have memory foam eat plugs , but the back of the earphone has <NUM> holes in it allowing sound to pour right in anyway ! this completely nullifies any sound isolation gained by the earplug style ear buds ! it provided absolutely no noise cancelation on my plane ride
i had to hold my fingers over the <NUM> holes to block out the engine noise pouring in through the back of the ear bud
the next problem is in construction
i am a tall guy
the little eat buds are too small for my ears , so i use the larger plugs included
they are too long and the plastic tube they fit over is too short
the foam extends well past the plastic support tube , allowing the tip of the earbud to be squished closed as it sits in your ear
as a result , sometimes you hear nothing
finally , the plastic fitting of the ear bud , where the foam meats the housing of the ear bud , has a rough edge on it
i found it scratching my ear and it eventually caused a small sore , after the <NUM> hour flight i was on
other than that , the speakers provide fairly good sound
if it weren not for all the other problems , i'd say these were good ear buds
but , because of the several flaws , i wish it didn not cost so much to ship these back and get a refund
as far as i am concerned , i wasted $10 on these .
just super sound coming form this small device
i use it when i travel on the airplane and discovered i don not need the bulky expensive noise canceling headphones
with the ear plugs nicely placed , all you hear is great sound , and its easy to carry around
definitely recommend it .
good deal for the $
the foam earplugs fit much nicer , especially if you have big old ear holes , like i do
this is my 3rd pair and i have liked all of them
these are probably the best units in the $12 range
the sound is pretty decent for the price if if you get them inserted and postioned correctly
if they are slightly out of perfect insertion ( easy to do ) , either bass or highs will suffer
with that said , i really encourage you to wait until you can save up for something better
as i said , it is a hassle to get a good insertion/fit with these ( the pinch/roll/wait for expansion thing is not quick )
once you do , you don not want to move around because they will shift and/or fall out very easily in my experience
this last point is a deal killer for me
save up $20 more and go with the sony ex81l if you are on a budget or look at the shure line if you have money to burn .
i was looking for something to replace the headphones that came with my ipod since they are extremely uncomfortable but i do like the sound quality
i have been through about <NUM> different kinds
some i have passed off due to comfort and some due to bad sound quality
these ear buds are like putting the small foamy ear plugs in your ears
i have always found them pretty comfortable and these headphones are the same
the sound quality is very different than the ipod ear buds and full of bass
they also certainly block out a lot of background noise
like i said , they are like putting in the foamy earplugs
i highly recommend these headphones , especially like the price .
my old headphones stopped working on a flight from nyc to la
though my headphones were already not the best ( blah set that came with my mp3 player ) , i hadn not had the inclination/energy to buy another pair until i was desperate
in other words , i was too lazy
well , i was now and desperate , so it was time to spring for a new one
i tend to like the "in ear" headphones because of the sound quality that comes through in loud environments ( loud cities , subway , airplanes , road noise )
i bought the koss "plug" with hopes that the earbuds would fit perfectly into my ears
i have ears and don not usually have problems with earplugs for bedtime
however , no matter how much i played around with the foam plugs on the koss set , after minutes of fantastic sound ( yes , the sound is amazing ! ) , the plugs would just voluntarily fall out of my ears , for no apparent reason
i tried squeezing , pinching , twisting , pushing , pulling , and even switching various plug sizes , etc
but with no luck
and even though i am feeling the burden of returning to the store ( circuit city--amazon is price is cheaper ) , my koss plug is going back
i don not want to the plugs into my ear to listen to music
that is not the idea here
but , take note : the bass and general sound of "the plug" is fantastic
if it fits your ears ( lucky thing , you ) , stick with this one for the sound and the cost
otherwise , don not waste your money
it will only add to your pile of "things i may use one day" and we all have too much of that stuff , don not we ?
first , while i am no audiophile and won not attempt to offer comments about the smooth , deep bass or crisp highs
your results may vary
i will say that i am personally very pleased with the sound from these earbuds and find the isolation they offer is a real plus
in fact , that is partly why i bought them : working sometimes in a very noisy environment that necessitates wearing hearing protectors , i thought it would be nice if i could turn them into headphones and at least enjoy some music while working
i have never cared for earbuds that rest in your outer ear , so prone to falling out
with the hearing protectors on over them , it was still rather easy to tug the earbug out of position
&quot ; the plug&quot ; stays quite well put , thanks to the soft foam cushions
away from work , the noise isolation of these stereophones continues to serve a great function , especially when travelling on airplanes or in any noisy environment
it is the isolation offered by the ear cushions that surely attribute to their efficiency
even headphone outputs on portable music players will likely still have all it needs to drive these plugs sufficiently for enjoyable listening
the drawback of the ear cushions is , as others have said , that they do mean you must be careful about how you position the plugs in your ears , as that will affect overall sound quality
the bass is excellent yet can become &quot ; boomy&quot ;
that is why i say &quot ; your results may vary&quot ;
but , for anyone willing to spend some time getting familiar with &quot ; the plug&quot ; , i think they will be happy with the sound potential provided
about the custom fit
yes , they really do custom fit to your ear canal if you choose the appropriate size cushions from those included
however , again as mentioned , the provided cushions do not remain compressed very well while attempting to insert the plugs in your ears
moreover , while the foam does seem to be the best i have experimented with in terms of comfort against the skin and general acoustic performance , it doesn not hold up very well over time
so , this led me to exploring for a substitute , and learning in the process what a difference in sound the type of foam makes
as i write this , i am wearing my plugs , modified by replacing the koss foam cushions with some i made myself from aearo classic foam ear plugs
the beauty of this approach is that as the ear plugs are designed for hearing protection , they do compress very well and hold their compressed shape longer , making it easier to insert the plugs into your ear canal , for a better and deeper fit
but , therein lies the rub
it is that more deep , secure fit that affect sound quality
my observation is that the impact is primarily upon the bass
making it even deeper and risking again a potential &quot ; boomy&quot ; quality
i am pleased with the results i obtained from the aearo ear plugs after trimming them down in diameter so there wasn not quite so much foam to &quot ; bulk up&quot ; in my ear
while the aearo plugs work well and sound good , i have found an even more comfortable and ( i think ) alternative in using howard leight laser lite foam ear plugs
the latter have a noise reduction rating of <NUM> and are made of a softer , foam than the aearos
i think the aearos have a similar nrr , but they are not labeled with it
now , how do you go about making your own ear cushion ? the approach i took was to compress one end of the foam ear plug down until it was basically flattened squarely against the other end on a flat surface
then , holding the &quot ; pancaked&quot ; plug in place , i heated a large nail over a flame and then pierced the center of the ear plug with the tip of the nail , pushing it gently through the foam so as not to tear the foam
rotating the nail tended to help
once the hole was pierced through the foam to the other end , i lifted the foam off the surface and pushed the nail fully through , this also serving to tug the foam along enough that it helped it to stretch back out along the nail shaft
once the nail cooled a bit , i slid the plug off the nail and had a rather cleanly pierced ear plug that i could then slip onto &quot ; the plug&quot ;
if the new ear cushion was too long or too thick to fit my ear well , i'd trim it down gradually with sharp scissors
in the end , i made up several pairs of cushions to interchange as i like
the aearo plugs were rather easy to modify since the foam is stiffer and thus easier to pierce with the hot nail
but , with care , the laser lite plugs could also be pierced without tearing the foam and they are smaller in diameter such that i found no need to trim them , except in length
when the modified plugs are slipped over the sound delivery tube of &quot ; the plug&quot ; earpieces , ensure the tube does not get crimped and extends fully through the cushion so as to deliver the best quality sound
this may sound like a lot of work for such inexpensive headphones , but they are headphones for a small price and can be customized to your own liking with a similar approach to what i describe
when i am not using &quot ; the plug&quot ; , i switch to my koss ktxpro1 titanium headphones
another pair of excellent headphones that i don not think can be beat for the price
they too sound great and have very good efficiency , at about the same price as &quot ; the plug&quot ;
they are for an office environment where you need an type earpiece to hear conversation through , rather than being isolated
the volume control on the cord is also a real convenience and is the only thing i find missing from &quot ; the plug&quot ; .
these headphones are the best idea i have seen in quality sound for several years ! first the foam is similar to those &<HASHTAG> ; &<HASHTAG> ; safety earplugs- you simply roll the foam between two finger and insert the headphones into the ear
the foam them blocking out sounds and noise letting you hear your music , books , etc
much cleaner
the foam on these is easily replaceable and come with a replacement set
koss has been known for years for their quality sounds equipment and these headphone/ is are no exception
the sound quality of these was <PERCENT> better than my bose headphones and the noise blocking was unsurpassed with these koss &<HASHTAG> ; the plug&<HASHTAG> ; headphones
they have even replaced my $249
00 headphones with their quality and great sound experience
a word of caution however , they do block sounds around you , so make sure not to wear them if you need to hear anything else around you
then again you might want too especially when those around you are boring and annoying !
you will read reviews of this product talking about how quickly the foam plugs bounce back , and that you can not get them in your ears fast enough
koss obviously made great improvements to the foam
the foam is now slow recovery , meaning you can get it into your ear
this alleviates the only real downside to the product .
i gave these <NUM> stars because the price of $6 ! they are somewhat heavy on the bass side but thats ok with me since its not overkill and you can always adjust the bass with an eq
i did not read any of the reviews before buying them as they were cheap enough , but now im amazed at how good they sound
i wont tell you these are great , just letting you know they are a good to try
i also liked the ksc75 is which for a few $$ more are another great buy and sound better but are ( over ear ) style .
i kept seeing these on the rack in my local supermarket for $15 and finally gave in and bought them
i hate wearing headphones , as i wear glasses and the ear pads always jam the arms of my glasses into the sides of my skull and hurt me after a short while
these koss buds are very comfortable
i also travel on airplanes quite a bit and don not want to fork out the big bucks for hissy so this seemed like a good compromise
these plugs seal out external noise quite well
they are also reasonably efficient , and have stacks of bass - sometimes i have to use the eq on my mp3 player to knock the bass down a bit
the top end is a little bit messy ( cymbals don not sound that clear ) , but the overall performance is very good ; considering the price
very lightweight
cable is very thin
they came with a set of about <NUM> replacement sponge ear plugs
no volume control .
i have owned sennheiser , sony and other headphones , and these are by far the best of the lot
i have used my pair for five months , and they have held up well to the rigors of daily use
factor in the price , and you can not go wrong .
note : i received a a black model
also , they are ported ( holes on the outside of the housing to allow pressure transfer , but which don not seem to diminish noise isolation
pro : the noise isolation with these is great : the eartips are the squishy foam , just like hearos and other earplugs
the result is a really good seal with your ear canal
when riding the bus or walking around , i am able to turn my ipod down from 50-<PERCENT> volume to around 10-<PERCENT>
it is a huge difference
con : the cord is composed of a spongy , grippy rubber
it is the perfect material to use on those dashboard grips you see advertised , where you put something on it ( like a ) and it stays put
however , for a cord it is annoying , as it prevents you from wrapping it , and it just feels stiff and icky
the cord also transfers a lot of vibration noise to your ears when you are in motion
maybe this is normal for all headphones ? i don not have enough experience with them
it is my guess that a less stiff , springy material might have been better
solution : run the cord for one ear over the back of your neck ( if your neck is small enough ) as it will reduce the pull on your ears .
i have many headphones , many of the head band variety and some of the conventional earbud variety
this is my first purchase of the in the ear type
i never expected the fit to be as comforatble as i found it to be , and did not expect the sound to be as good as it is
i think that koss is aiming for high volume sales at a very low price for such an excellent product
on top of it all they offer a lifetime guarantee
how can you beat this bargain ?
i just received the plug and gave it a try on my nano
i bought the plug in order to replace the ipod set which bugs me while running on the treadmill at my local gym
needless to say i have given up my efforts to get some decent sound out of them
i shoved them as far as i could up my ear canal , up to the point of pain
sound was mediocre at best compared to the "stock" earphones that came with the ipod
it is of great mystery to me why some of the reviewers gave them such high ratings
standard ipod sets are way better
on the other hand i did not expect anything great due to the price
you mostly get what you pay for ! now i am waiting for my etymotic isolator head set which should ( hopefully ) be of better comfort and sound quality
my advice is to spend a few more dollars in order to get a good set .
bought these for me to try since my "tecki" son asked for these for himself
i have got little ears and find these extremely uncomfortable
i shoot shotguns , so i know how to use foam ear plugs but these are just too big for me
i will probably give them to my husband who has big old ears
most other ear buds i have bought include three sizes of ear cushions , these have only two
big and bigger
the sound quality is heavy on bass with no treble
i don not know squat about ohms and hz or other sound lingo but i do know what i like to hear in my music and these just don not cut it for me
i usually don not pay more than $20 for ear buds because the right ear sound always quits after awhile
even the bose had this problem after <NUM> months
these looks like they are well made and i do like the fact that there is a flex joint at both the ear buds and the .
these are ok earbuds as far as sound quality but not better than ones that came with my
they are more durable than orgionals and stay in the ear better but they seem to take more volume to hear well and i find the sound quality on the koss "spark plugs" much better .
the first time i bought the plug , i thought the sound was tiny and weak , and i immediately returned it
then i saw someone mentioned the purple v
blue ( earlier version ) , and i purchased it again , making sure it was purple
sure enough , the purple ones are great ! like other koss headphones , you not only hear the bass , but you also feel it
it is amazing that such big bass can come out of these tiny earplugs
i replaced the included foam plugs with regular plugs from a drugstore and they make an even better seal
i also have the etymotic er6i , which costs at least <NUM> times more than this one
when it comes to sound , of course the er6i have a much higher fidelity ( but much less bass ) , but considering the price difference , i think these koss earplugs have a greater value
overall , the sound quality is just average , but if you mostly listen to pop while on the road , you probably won not mind or care that some notes are a little imbalanced and muddy
as far as sound isolation go , after replacing the included foam plugs with the ones from the drugstore , they are as good as the etymotics
be sure to get the purple ones !
koss "the plug" , for only $13 , is a terrific way to try the type of headphone
they are very comfortable to wear for long periods , have terrific bass , good sound and are comfortable to wear when in bed
one is opinion of headphone sound is very subjective and comparison is limited because you cannot instantly change from one phone to another
one reason that there are endless opinions of headphone sound
the plug has foam inserts that expand too fast making it almost impossible to get it into the ear before it expands
if you do not get a good air seal , there will be little or no bass
the fix is to buy a set of foam ear plugs ( walmart $1
47 for 12 )
squeeze it flat , use a scissor for cut proper length , under water , let it expand full size , freeze it and then drill the hole to replace the existing foam insert
you will end up with an ear plug that really works and is very comfortable to wear
you probably will be so happy with "the plug" that you won not have to upgrade to the $300 models !
i own a number of different koss , sennheiser , sony and grado products and i am extremely pleased with them all
( i truly believe grado is the best of the four companies but they don not make an product
) these "plugs" are good for nothing in my opinion unless one wants to go deaf , get a blistering headache and have ringing in the ears
the distortion can only be described as a "sonic bass mudslide" that overwhelms and perverts all sounds coming through these "plugs
" i am genuinely shocked that koss would put their name to such a terrible product ; perhaps these "plugs" are designed for a younger generation that wants to be deaf by <NUM> while listening to the type of "boom boom" bass that rattles windows ? but these "plugs" are the exact opposite of what an audiophile or anyone else who wants to just "listen" and "hear" his/her music , books , etc
through headphones
before the blistering eight hour headache these "plugs" had given me was through , they were repackaged and shipment was arranged for a refund
i have never been disgusted by a koss product before but i feel that i write out my experience as a warning to others
audiophiles and music lovers , beware ! in terms of headphones , i would recommend the updated version of "the plug" known as "the spark plug
" it doesn not have as long of a cord but they haven not set my teeth on edge or caused headaches such as the one i received from "the plug" and they do offer some passive noise reduction
i also recommend the sennheiser headphones
they are more expensive ( in the dollar range ) but worth it if you have the money because sennheiser does make a better product in my opinion than koss these days
the truth is that sennheiser surpasses koss on almost everything these days
if you don not like headphones ( and i am not much of a fan of them myself with a few exceptions ) and don not want to spend more than $[
] , the koss portapro , sennheiser , ( awesome and blocks sound ! ) , the igrado , grado sr60 ( the best for pure sound ! ) , sony ( great little set ! ) and koss ktxpro1 are excellent alternatives that i believe are truly worth five to ten times what they cost
i hope this was of some help .
the original foam cusion is not very comfortable
there is an excellent article on[
] which describe a simple mod to make it an excellent sound isolating monitor
based on your listening preference , you may decrease the bass or mid level damping
the mod will make it a poor man is shure .
i own <NUM> pairs of these now and am totally satisfied with them
i have probably about <NUM> sets of ear buds and headphones for a variety of purposes
not any single set serves one purpose but for the purposes i use these for ( casual listening while sitting or walking and noise isolation ) these are perfect
they are the only device i will use to listen to music through my smart phone or laptop
i love the way they seal of the sounds from the outside world as the foam stem covers slowly expand in your ears .
the horrible ear buds that came with my pricey mp3 player not only gave me an earache but were a pain in the neck to keep in place
i could wear these little koss plugs all day long and never know they are there
and sound quality is perfect .
these work for some people is ears and not for others
one reviewer claimed that i must be either retarded or deformed since they don not work for me
that reviewer is best described by words not allowed in this venue
i am going to replace the useless foam , others have suggested : for hunters : silencio super sound baffler earplugsfrom a pharmacy : flents &quot ; quiet please&quot ; i believe you have to create the center hole in these products to retrofit them to the koss' &quot ; stem&quot ;
- jeff
after a month of use , i am quite satisfied with my purchase
the foam inserts are far more comfortable than any other style i have worn
the sound quality exceeds standard headsets that generally come with mp3 players and walkman stereos
they are not audiophile caliber , but considering the price , they sound fine
i wear them while running and they are sweatproof , so far -- and unaffected by any "stethoscope" effect that other reviewers have noted about sony earphones
i can also adjust how deep i place the plug in my ear canal , enabling me to hear the environmental sounds ( sirens , horns , etc
) that affect my saftey , when running in public places
it is too early to comment on durability , but i do treat them carefully , as i would any lightweight/portable headphones
an excellent buy at under $15
good sound isolation , too much bass for realistic sound , might be ok if you only listen to disco
very uncomfortable after about <NUM> minutes .
this product is a great value
when coupled with the ( 2 pair , trilevel - earphones plus brand replacement ear cushions made to fit klipsch , shure , etymotic and other models requiring a 2mm attachment diameter
clear , large ) it makes these ear buds on par with higher cost phones .
don not expect these to last for more than months before one of the sides stop working
used them for ~1 hr a day <NUM> days a week for exercising , and they broke after <NUM> months
very poorly made , and $9 for a warranty replacement .
i always liked koss headphones
the price and the sound
some reviews say that it is bass heavy
if you have an eq mode on your mp3 player then try that to adjust the sound to your liking
ipods and zunes players have good eq settings
love the ear cushions
they fit really good
would recommend these headphones especially for the pricenote : to get the cushions to fit in properly
try this , lightly squeeze the foam then insert in to your ear and hold for about <NUM> sec
it should form inside the ear and you not have a problem of them slipping out .
i find these ear buds to be very comfortable , decent at sealing out surrounding noise and have decent sound
one downside is that because the sound comes through a plastic tube , if you are opening your mouth ( i
eating , yawning ) the tube will pinch and the sound will become muffled , but this is only temporary .
i have bought these before and had the left ear plug go out after <NUM> months
koss has a lifetime replacement guarantee so i returned them and after <NUM> months with my new ones the same thing happened
for the price its not bad but be warned you get what you pay for .
i can confirm that this model here does not have the volume control , thankfully
edit : after owning these for several months , i put a pair through the wash
they still worked but the foam died
i bought another pair , and have concluded these are overall the best buds for the price
edit <HASHTAG> : after ordering a second pair and using them for a bit , they too have given way and the expansive response of the foam no longer prevails amidst the sweat , etc
therefore i am off to buy my 3rd set
for such a low price , i really could care less .
now these are not balanced to start with , more boost in the muddy area ( )
but with a little cut in this area they are sooooo good
they rival even my sony when this cut is applied
i also have an communications headset from koss , for $50 , which i have used for gaming and mixing audio
koss just makes great sounding gear , but pay for the high end stuff to get balanced .
great sound while they worked
one earpiece just quit working all of a sudden .
i am giving a <NUM> star review for these earphones with a couple big caveats
i have owned a lot of portable headphones throughout the years and most recently have used a set of koss sportapros that have served me well ; they sound good ( not as good as the portapros , but still good ) and were pretty cheap
but they leak sound terribly , meaning they are not a great choice for listening on a crowded subway or while at work , and also are not that convenient to carry around
when i recently bought an ipod and finally got to try out some headphones , i loved the convenience of being able to stuff both my player and the phones into one pocket when not in use , but i never could get the stock ipod headphones to fit my ear
they didn not sound particularly good either
so i knew i wanted to try something else
i first bought a pair of sennheiser is , and while i actually liked their sound a lot ( better than the stock ipod phones ) , they didn not fit my ears any better
they'd fall out even if i so much as turned my head to one side
one of my then recommended the plug , and at such a low price i figured i'd give them a shot
i have now spent a few days with mine and my feelings on the whole are mixed , but i do feel these earphones are a pretty good value
most importantly to me is that so far , they are the only headphones i have found that don not seem to require constant fiddling to ensure they stay in place
i do have to use the largest of the several types of included cushions - i apparently have very large ear canals - but they seem fairly secure ( though not tight ) once they are in there
some people may find this type of earphone uncomfortable - you really have to place them well up into your ear canals ( make sure you clean your ears well every day ! ) - but i find them much more comfortable than the standard designs included with most portable players because you don not have this piece of hard plastic wedged into your ear
, i'd say they are fine , though certainly not remarkable
my is sound better , and my sportapros sound a *lot* better
i'd put these about on par with the included ipod headphones
they are pretty bass and heavy , though like other headphones the "bass" isn not really very bassy - it cuts off well above what most larger headphones can reproduce
it ends up sounding a bit forced and artificially juiced , and there is a lot of this fake "bass"
on the high end , there is a lack of clarity - things like cymbal crashes sound "muddy" and ragged
this is typical of headphones of any type
still , i'd rate the sound "good enough" considering the application most people will use these for ( portable listening ) , and considering the increased comfort and dramatically better physical stability vs
more headphones .
i wanted to give "the plug" a fair shot , so i bought a pair
first of all , everything you have read about the stock foam earpieces is true ; they are worthless
the foam expands way too fast for you to compress it , shove it in your ear , and have it expand to get a good seal
so i followed some of the recommendations given in the reviews here , and modified some foam earplugs
now at least they will stay in my ears
i am recommending that people spend a little more money and buy the sony fontopia earbuds , and here is why : -they seal really well to your ear canals , once you have selected the proper size silicone adapter
the result is excellent bass
-you can put them in and pull them out really quickly
on insertion , they just go in and seal , there is no waiting around for the foam to expand and seal
you can quickly yank one or both of them out , and be able to plug them right back in
this is really a good thing if you want to use them at work
-the sound of the sony earbuds is just plain superior to the koss'
really , it is
they are worth twice the money of the koss' , which is about what they cost
about the only reason i may keep the koss' around is that , with my foam earplug modification , they probably block more ambient noise than the sonys , and they seem to be more efficient ( more volume for a given drive level )
these two factors make them a good candidate for use when i am riding my motorcycle
if it weren not for this , i wouldn not even consider them over the sonys .
i was intrigued by the raves for these very inexpensive headphones , and the koss brand name convinced me to give them a try
i compared them to the sennheiser hd56 headphones that i normally use for portables , and my akg 240df headphones that have been used by many studio engineers in recording albums
the koss the plug headphones have excellent dynamic range and sensitivity
this means that you will get more volume out of weaker amps , such as those found in multipurpose portables , like pdas and portable synths , like the yamaha qy series
they also have excellent bass , which together with the dynamic range , makes them excellent for any sort of modern dance music
unlike another reviewer , i did not find any problem with the midrange or high end
i suspect that this perception some people have had , is due to the fact that increasing the bass automatically makes the midrange and highs seem muted - especially in headphones
as others have mentioned , the fit is critical to the sound quality
read the instructions found on the inside of the card in the packaging
even the orientation of the earphones in your ear can affect the sound
experiment a little until you find the best sound
warning : these headphones can go very loud with portables that have decent amps ( mp3 and cd players )
famous musicians like pete townsend and jeff baxter have hearing problems from hours of loud music - so be careful !
these are some of the worse headphones i have tested the sound is horrible and tiny using an ipod touch no bass what so ever
i guess i have not learnt my lesson sony seems to have the best sounding headsets for this price range .
i was looking for headphones that i could be comfortable with for long periods of time
i use my mp3 player for listening to audio books , and the headphones that came with it became very uncomfortable after just a short period of time in my ears
i also didn not want to spend a fortune
after much looking i decided to give these a try , and they have worked out great
they are comfortable for as long as i wear them which has been many hours at a time
the cables are too long , which seems to be the case with any heaphones i have seen , so that is something to live with
for the price i don not think they can be beat .
not a lengthy review
just my <NUM> to tell everyone who is curious aboutthese koss "plug is" as i was a week ago
very comfy in my ear
stay put w/o
great sound , deep bass & i still hear the highs too
brings my mp3 player "alive" at last
the free extra set of "rubber/foam" tips is great ! mine came in "black" , although any of the available colorslook great imo
i started to buy the newer version of the koss earplugscalled the "sparkplug" , but after reading alot of userreviews , opted to buy these instead
they are well worth the $14
don not hesitate if you are considering thisbrand
they have a lifetime guarantee ( no questions asked )
you will be glad you got them
hard to believe that some other brands sell for upwards of several hundred dollars
they simply can not sound much ( if any ) better than these do
these are great ear buds
if you squish the foam down and quickly put them in your ears , they expand and fit to your ears
helps to block outside noises , and makes them comfortable
they feel secure and don not fall out if i am moving around
great for people who like to walk around with an ipod
great bass , which is really important to me .
i wrote a long review about all the benefits of these eaplugs , but then i figured - i am the jillionth person to review these
i am not sure i can add anything , so i will make this quick : cool earphones
work great , cost nothing , totally camouflaged
not sure ? buy both kinds
thank you
two of my kids have a problem with keeping ear buds in their ears , always being too big for them
they love koss nothe plug' headphones because you can manipulate them into your ear cannel , fitting snug
the only drawback is your earwax tends to cling to them , so they will need to be cleaned .
good base and good sound
i buy one and usually send them back to koss for $9 ( lifetime warranty ) when they crap out
i am a heavy user and use these virtually every day anywhere from 1
5- <NUM> hours/day .
i always get sore ears from the standard earbuds that ipods provide
i have got ears and the buds are really painful after a while
these koss headphones are like little sponges that you squeeze when putting in
then they expand to fit the exact size of your ear
they also have great sound
definitely worth ordering .
i bought these earbuds specifically to wear while riding a motorcycle
this application requires good sound isolation to protect against dangerous levels of wind noise and a close fit without protrusions poking into the helmet liner
the plug received good reviews on a few mc forums so i had to try it
the noise isolation is ok , about as good as theklipsch image s2 earphoneswith silicone seals
the photo of these kosses is deceptive though , and the plastic part that stays outside your ear is much too big
not only does it snag on my shoei each time i remove it , the sharp edges of the ring also dig into my earlobes
( the klipsch are similarly too long , but at least they have no sharp edges
) for any other application these are probably a good value for money
tl ; dr if your helmet fits correctly , these won not
i am returning them .
i have tried out a number of and isolating headphones with an ipod
here are my impressions : shure e4c ( isolating ) : the most accurate and open i know of
with source electtronics and material , these ( or the e5c is ) would be the pick of the lot
unfortunately , they are too revealing for listening to compressed source material through the mediocre electronics of an ipod and very quickly become very fatiguing in that context
their other disadvantage is obvious : they are quite expensive
sennheiser pxc <NUM> ( ) : these are my favorites
very accurate without being too unforgiving for an ipod
their disadvantages : comparatively bulky & won not play as loudly as any of the others mentioned here
sennheiser ( isolating ) : considerably more compact and somewhat less expensive than the pxc 300 , these are also quite good
bass can be very tubby ( that might be improved by stiffer custom inserts , but that would more than double the price ) koss "the plug" ( isolating ) : laughably innacurate
buy these only if you have tin ears and a habit of losing small things on airplanes
otherwise do yourself a favor and invest a bit more in one of the alternatives .
these have very good bass , although they don not sound as good as my sennheiser cx300
the price is cheap so i mainly use it when i am on the streets so , if someone steals it i wouldn not get very angry .
note : the description i saw on the amazon page does not reflect the product i have
above it discusses a headband and an adapter which are not part of this product
also , the rated frequency response is , not
i think this is ( or was ) an amazon editorial error
my interest for this product is as a solution to listening to music , lectures , and movies while travelling , and i travel a lot
i have a set of panosonic headphones which were good ( about five times more expensive than these earbuds ) though bulky , but the plastic broke so they won not stay on my head now
these earbuds are an excellent alternative to headphones for the frequent traveller
i find them more comfortable for extended listening than most conventional headphones
the ability to seal out noise from the external environment is very good , and makes it possible to understand what actors are saying when watching a movie on an airplane
the overall performance - sound quality and noise blocking - is not as good as the bose noise cancelling headphones , but the bose are <NUM> times as expensive , much less convenient to carry , and subject to damage from the rough world of the road warrior
if the plug had an optional unit ( say , combined with the eq ) , it would be a killer combination - are you listening , koss ? )
the sound is good
, to be sure ; i would like them better if they had a flatter response , but the product is marketed at the portable music crowd , and many of them are looking for dramatic bass rather than sound
besides , mobile sound is always a compromise , it is just a question of whether the compromise they chose works for you
here are some problems i have heard and the solutions : 1
"they fall out of my ear
" i think an older version of this product did not come with alternative cushions ; the ones i bought recently ( as pictured here ) came with <NUM> alternative cushion pairs , one of which fit well in my somewhat large ears
to make them fit well , roll the cushions in your fingers and squeeze them down , then hold them in place in your ears while they adjust the fit
also , it is possible to fashion your own cushions ( easy modification to commercially available ear plugs from pharmacy ) ; go to google and search for "koss plug mods"
what about when i have to replace the cushions , they will get waxy/dirty with use ? see last sentence of <HASHTAG>
"they sound tinny"
i have a sense that the sound was tinnier on an earlier version of these earbuds , judging from comments i have read in feedback and on the koss plug mods page
the purple plugs ( as opposed to the older ( ? ) blue ones ) do not sound tinny to me ; they seem a bit heavy on the bass instead
koss also makes a eq ( 20 dollars ) for their headphones that can be used to adjust the sound some
i have an eq on order , hoping it may temper the boomy bass a bit
of course , your player may have a way of changing the color of the sound , but my laptop does not
"they are easy to lose
" the price of their tiny size and negligible weight , is that you need to be careful not to lose them
i have already lost a pair
koss also makes a carrying case which may help , or you could just put them in a 35mm film canister
but at $
a pair ( compared to $
for headphones ) i will just keep a spare pair around in my travelling case
overall i am pleased with the price/performance tradeoff for these earbuds , and they are an essential part of my travelling kit
they sound better than any other earbuds i have used , and they remove a good bit of the ambient sound , offering more pleasure in listening
i give four stars out of five because i'd prefer a less bassy sound , though some people will really like the way they sound .
i got these in spite of some of the poorer reviews , because i wanted some earphones small enough to slip in my purse , but my ears are too small or shaped in such a way that regular earbuds are impossible and/or painful to wear
this seemed like the perfect alternative
and it *could* be
however , the &quot ; &quot ; foam earplugs included are more like
i have never seen foam earplugs that go to full size again so fast
they really are tough to get in if you leave the headphones inserted
the trick i found was to slip the plugs off the headphone pieces , roll it up really tight and insert just the plug into your ear
then slightly move it around until the hole for the headphone is lined up , and stick them in through the hole
that is the only way i think you could ever get the things in your ear
other than that , i am pleased enough with them
they definitely are way more comfortable for me and stay in better than regular earbuds
really makes you wonder though , if they even had actual consumers try the earplugs out before releasing them .
i owned a pair of the older ( blue and yellow ) koss plugs and i modified them to fit better using flents earplugs instead of the one koss supplied ( see the headwize website for modifications you can do
) those worked ok ( though they were still a little uncomfortable
) when i ordered this new version of plugs i could not get them to fit right and the sound was really tinny
fortunately i found the sony
much more comfortable than these , thank goodness ! no earphones fit everyone well , and the koss earphones don not work well at all it you have shallow ears
the sony is also cost three times more than the koss , but the comfort is worth it .
i have tried many brands but the koss have been my favorite for years , yes they die but i use them during workouts , runs , etc
i would say i go through about 3/year and think they are well worth it
i also have the gold kdx models ( two ) , sent them for repairs and the customer service was nice
didn not see that they were any better than other buds i have
again , ok for the money
yo yo yo
good solid earbuds
the sound is surprisingly good , really a step up from the cheap sony $9
99 earbuds
they are very comfortable , and stay in your ear well
i can not stand the feeling of that coarse foam that is used on most headphones , so these are a great alternative
also , the 4' cord is nice , compared to most other earbuds that only have a 3' cord
the only potential problem i see , is that the cord is fairly small gage wire , hope it doesn not break , but they do have a lifetime warranty .
okay , the price of these has gone up since the last time i bought some ( i have given a lot of these to friends
i am wacky about them ) but not by much
as was mentioned , they do crap out-- i have had one that quit working and another that broke while i was treating it very roughly
anyway , i think that these are ideal if your player has an eq on it
these , contrary to what another poster has mentioned , are *very* bassy
i have found that by plugging just about half of the little holes on the back attenuates the bass if an eq isn not an option
they block sound quite well , better than any other nr headphones i have used
the weakness in my experience has been treble-- i use the eq to boost the treble and drop the bass and these sound spectacular ( i have to do the opposite for my grado headphones )
i don not think that you could find anything better for this price ( and i have tried )
the other nice thing is that if they do break or get lost , it is no big deal ! pair these with a cheap 1gb sandisk player ( the cheap sandisks that i have used have eqs ) and you have a nice , investment for the gym or anywhere else where they might be damaged
as for the poor bass comment-- they are tricky to get seated at first
poorly seated plugs will sound tinny and weak
give them a shot ! not much to lose here .
i tried the expensive active noise cancelling thing in stores ( including bose ) and have always been disapoited that it should be more like "noise dampening" but definitively not "cancelling"
same thing with this
you hear the outside world as you do when you use ear plugs ( i
the noise is lowered ) but when you play the music , particularly if you like to play it somewhat loud , then you can not really hear anything from outside ! for $10 i take that over the $300+ stuff any day ! the bass is a bit strong for my taste , but i can adjust that on my mp3 player
i must warn you though , i am not a audio file
i like a good sound , but that is about it
so if you try headphones like some people taste wines
then forget about my review
but if you want something that blocks the outside noise enough ( i couldn not hear my loan mower while the music was playing , at all ! ) while you listen to your music and don not want to spend a fortune , these things are great ! i will be buying another set as soon as these die for sure !
"the plug" offers very poor balance across the sound spectrum , they are very bass heavy/boomy , resulting in a very muddy sound
unless you listen to your music with the bass turned all the way up , i suggest looking elsewhere
also , the acoustic tube is far too rigid and can scratch/gouge your ear canal
overall , a poor choice .
i bought nothe plug' after reading all kinds of reviews for it and similar products
it really is a nice stereophone for the money
the sound quality is very good and i have not noticed that it has too much bass as several other reviews said
the like ear pieces are pretty comfortable ( i wear mine up to <NUM> hours a day ) and provide moderate sound insulation
i would estimate they cut noise ( comparing them to the performance of earplugs rated at 32db )
the only concern i have is that they are a little bit flimsy
i wear them every day at work in machine shop so the sound dampening is essential and enables me to listen to music except when using the noisiest machines
a great buy for the money .
i use sony 51 is in the gym and they are a nice earbud phone but i have had them for awhile and wanted to try something else
i read some reviews and ordered these
first off they need to go it like hearing protection foam plugs
you squeeze and rotate the foam plug and insert it in your ear as you pull the top of your ear back with the other hand
they must be held in place for several seconds so the foam can expand and conform to your ear
if you insert them properly they do sound very good but with exaggerated bass
if you like exaggerated heavy bass these are for you
as for the guy who said buy a dozen or half dozen and thank him later , idon not think that that is necessary
they are very nice sounding for the price and work good in the gym for me
if your mp3 player has an eq you can select a curve that makes them sound more realistic
hope that helps !
these headphones have excellent sound quality , especially in the bass ranges
the foam pad is very comfortable and does not hurt my ear , even after hours
it requires a little more effort than most headphones to roll the cushion , put it in your ear canal , hold it and wait for it to expand , then carefully remove hand , but it pays off with noise reduction and great sound and a snug fit
the dark purple plastic is a little strange , and they do look funny , but that is a very minor detail
great product .
the ear cushions that come with this product are terrible
i used an awl to make a hole in the earplug , and then cutoff a bit off the top of the earplug
i cut it off a bit too much , just cut it off a little
the sound from this product is great for an earbud style headphone
to increase isolation , i use a hearing protector ear muff on top of the plug and i really can not hear anything after doing it
the main point , buy foam earlugs and these things will be a lot more comfortable and will let you enjoy your music more by eliminating background noise .
as a long time philips he592 user i was looking for something better or at least as good
in a comparision the results are clear
the koss require more power on the signal to create the sound ( 1
more )
the bass is jittery and the overall sound quality poor
there is not nearly as much bass as the he592
compared to the he592 it sounds like you are listening to the playback through a metal can .
these are actually a replacement
my first set lasted for a few year and needed another
best earbuds for the money hands down !
i have owned two pairs of these earphones , and i love them ! "noise cancelling wannabe is"
by me saying this i am applauding koss for the price to quality ratio
you could spend $100+ for a noise cancelling pair of headphones , but i find that these headphones do equally good of a job ( i have a pair of creative noise cancelling headphones , and i prefer the koss plug )
if you replace the provided foam plugs with regular foam ear plugs , you will get a much better fit
do this by triming a regular pair of foam ear plugs to the length of he "canal" on the plug
then drill a hole through the center using a small drill bit or use a needle and work around to make the hole bigger
this process is tedious i will admit , but having a clean pair ( negates the con listed below ) that fits better than the provided foam plugs is well worth it
you will also find that the replacement plugs will stay compressed longer , making it easier to insert into your ear
cons : the rubber "canal" that channels sound to your ear can fall off easily
if lose that
its all over ( this is why i gave it <NUM> stars instead of 5 )
build up of ear wax on the plugs ( no matter how well u clean ur ears , you will get some dirt build up on these things
replace the plugs every few months using modification above ) pros : price
deep bass ( even w/o "super bass" systems )
noise "cancelling" ability ( w/ modification listed above )
greatly enhance deep bass perception
very comfortable fit
balanced sound
come with an extra set of silicon ear plugs
potential problems : not too good with treble highs
i recommend that you get it only if your portable device has a minimum equalizer or if you are not a treble fanatic
also , the silicon plugs look like they might not last very long , but that is just speculation on my part since i have only had them for a few days
finally , it insulates from all ambient sounds , so if hearing sounds around you while listening to your portable player is important , then you should consider another design .
i needed some earphones that would be more comfortable and louder than the cheap earbuds i had
i am very happy with these on both accounts , and as a bonus they are much cheaper than a lot of the other options .
i don not know if they still come with a lifetime warranty but i'd buy them over again even if they didn not
it is hard to find a pair of headphones that are rated <NUM> to 23 , 000 hz
and if my memory serves me correctly , this design was groundbreaking and every one else copied them
i have always enjoyed the isolating aspect as well as the bass response from them
i have used the lifetime warranty a few times over the last <NUM> years and have had no problems .
these did not sound well at all and fit was even worse
ears got tired after just a few minutes during one song !
cannot accurately assess audio quality since the provided ear plugs did not fit properly , making it impossible to create adequate sound isolation .
after all the grand reviews , i had really high hopes and expectations for these
unfortunately , they have all the depth of a <NUM> transistor radio
i may have received the lemon pair but who wants to buy them again hoping for a better sounding ear bud ? don not waste your time is my advice
find a genuinely well made ear bud .
i think these work great
fit well , sound is just fine , and for the price , i have not found anything remotely in the same league
i can only assume the part about tasting good , as i have not eaten them myself , but my cat has devoured several sets , so my presumption is , in a pinch , wouldn not make a snack .
koss "the plug" portable headphones are indeed best bang for your bucks ! this product still after many years still on the market tells you that people are still buying them for their reliability and excellent sound quality
pros : [+] best sound for the money , well balanced bass , mids and highs[+] good construction and comfort[+] small enough to be tucked away[+] very good sound isolation and can be used in high noise environmentscons : [-] no con really but if you feel uncomfortable you can always modify the unit with other foams just use google as your best friendnote : the new generation of koss plug has slightly more hiss when you have very silent music the signal to noise ratio comes into play when there is improper impedance matching , i think it is due to the fact that they are now <NUM> ohms versus <NUM> ohms earlier ? correct me if i wrong
this was my "father is day" gift from my daughter , my earlier koss plug earphones which i purchased <NUM> years back ( which still works ) had very disgusting foam material due to daily use and abuse which my daughter could not tolerate , seeing me squeezing that dirty foam into my ears made her buy me a new set of earphones ! the new foam materials are better and hope this will last a decade just as the other
buy with confidence these are excellent earphones !
for me , these feel better and achieve a better seal than the norm
a good seal is essential for achieving strong bass
they are rated a little more efficient ( the db rating ) than many of the others , and this was noticeable .
i bought these for my husband since he has sensitive ears
he loves them !
i bought these in january 2005 , and the ones i got are apparently the new version
there is no mute button or detachable headband as on the previous version , and the claimed frequency response has been improved to <NUM> to 20 , 000 hz
they are inexpensive , and come with a "limited" lifetime warranty
as far as sound quality , it is very good
more importantly , they block all background noise so that i can actually hear the music when i am sitting at the back of a bus or in a noisy location
i prefer to listen to music at a quiet volume and it is nice not to have to blast my eardrums out just to hear the music
the fit is very secure , which i also like ( i always felt like my headphones were going to fall out of my ears ) .
i have used many low cost earbuds and there are a lot of decent ones out there
the really cheap ones are usually just that , cheap ! i find the $10
00 to $40
00 range offer among the best qualities someone may be looking for in decent , good sounding earbuds
most are good having varied degrees of what predominant type of sound you may be listening for
these koss earbuds offer a very good bass range with overall good sound and volume
the mids and highs are not as crisp but usually can be adjusted well enough for good tone
these buds are mostly for strong bass
the fit of these earbuds is one of the most comfortable with nice cushy , foam inserts that stay in your ear well and really eliminate most outside noise
in turn , they also provide a very discreet listening experience
i find the best way to insert these buds is to give them a little squeeze and stick them in my ear and let the foam expand in my ear
overall , the build quality of these earbuds appears to be quite good with minimal wire to bud noise transfer .
these earplugs fit well and sounded pretty good
bass response wasn not that great but what do you want for the price ?
loud as hell ! and sound proof to the world
you wont hear much past whats pumping through your headphones
bass is nice and deep
sharp sound
not for anyone that doesn not like things in their ears
best part , if you are a deaf fella like myself , you can pop the foam off of these and the tubes are the perfect fit for your old hearing aid in ear molds
can get that perfect fit .
i bought this for me
but my kids love them so much i have to buy a send set
they are that good .
for an earbud these are amazing
the sound quality rivals much larger , heavier and more expensive traditional circumaural earphones
they key is being sure you position them properly
you will know when you do because bass notes easily roll off when the seal and orientation of the plug is wrong
to get the most out of these , compress the foam by rolling it in your fingers and immediately put them in your ears
twist gently to seat them and you will be rewarded with good clear sound
the lifetime warranty is a plus
for the price these represent a truly great value
i can not simply understand nature of such negative feedbacks
don not like sound quality/durability/usability/etc ? - check price tag , scratch your head , try to find same durability/usability/etc for same price , i bet you can not
so this headphones perform amazingly well , compared to their $12 price tag
so don not expect $100 quality from these
if you still wonder what quality of sound these have , here is comparison with other koss products
this ( the plug ) , sounds worse than koss porta pro , but sounds better than koss ur10 ( but you need heavy eq usage to actually set these "plugs" to be better then ur10 )
hope this helps .
these babies sound pretty sweet for $12 ! don not waste your dough
get these , and turn down the bass on your ipod ( set eq to electronica ) , they will sound frickin sweet !
there are more expensive ear plugs but these work very well
i use them when i jog and while on the motorcycle .
this is my 3rd pair in about 10+ years
i wear them practically every other day - exercising or working in the yard
these are actually better than the previous ones ( from the same manufacturer ) that i bought at a brick and mortar
those had a very annoying "mute" button on the cord
these do not
compared to other ear plugs ( or in the ear headphones ) that i have , i can use these when i run or bike ( in the summer ) without them falling out
i have paid over $30 for others that didn not work half as well .
i now own three pair of these , they are a bargain , as i have dozens of earbuds ( mostly in ear ) and their efficiency and sealability give a full rich sound
the only pair i ever &<HASHTAG> ; broke&<HASHTAG> ; was a pair that i sent through the wash twice ! you will spend at least times their price to beat them
one audiofile stated that he felt another set was much better ( at $299
00 ) again , best value given their price and performance .
let me preface this quick review with the statement that i already own the shure e2 headphones , which are well known for their excellent sound quality
i did not purchase "the plug" with expectations of anything near the experience i have had with the e2 is
the e2 is are not perfect , however , and i have saved up some gripes for that review as well
in any case , i bought "the plug" as a backup and alternative to my other headphones , and i have many
on the new york city subways and city streets , isolating headphones are the only way to really hear your music without getting those huge over the ear style headphones
i see everyone with the white ipod style earbuds - can you even hear your music ? i swear that i had to turn the volume up all the way to even hear the music over the din of the city streets
so , i am already a convert to the experience
these headphones , however , are a total bummer
they don not fit in my ear with any of the built in foam inserts
they hurt
the sound is tinny , tiny and has no bass whatsoever
i tried every permutation of different foam plugs with no luck
i am sure the poor sound is entirely because they don not seal in my ear canal well
i looked around on the web - other people are having the same problem , and have gone so far as to create their own foam plugs to fit their ears better
unfortunately , i don not have the time nor the inclination to bother
so , back they go .
for a younger person with perfect hearing these might have less fidelity than others
however , these are extremely comfortable
the isolation from the outside noise is better than most other ear bud style phones
and , they don not have the fall out problems associated with typical ear buds
koss , "sparkplug" earphones are also worth consideration
the sparkplug model earphones sound about the same , but have a little higher profile out of ones ear .
 <NUM> reviews later , i will sum up the critical reasons why *i* absolutely love these "stereophones"
i have tried a lot of different earbud headphones looking for that obnoxious , over the top , heart attack bass sound that typifies my favorite style of music , drum'n'bass
they all fell far , far short compared to the plug
i was even willing to spend the big money on those shure is and etymotics but i have read they are weak with bass as well
dont bother with those sony ex51/71 fontopia is
they were a huge sonic disappointment and they have that stupid long right/short left cable arrangement
not these puppies
symmetrical cables baby ! bad parts : 1 ) eventually the foam cushions go "bad" from too much use and dont "inflate" the way they used to after being squeezed , causing them to fall out and dampen that beautiful bass
i used to just buy a new set when this happened ( ~1 year ) but i just found out about these "plug mods" so i will try that now
2 ) ear wax buildup ! eeewww ! yes , well , what else did you expect ? luckily the plugs lend themselves to a very easy clean if you have a paperclip or baby pin
but they do get very juicy pretty fast so dont buy these suckers used or try to share with your buddy
3 ) purple color is lame
4 ) no case provided and its gross sticking juicy buds in yr linty pants pocket and then putting em back in your ear
if you are some audiophile nerd who is more interested in highs than lows , i can not recommend these at all
if you have ever said "turn the bass down" out loud to someone , keep searching
but if you like the feeling of a big foam bullet gradually expanding in your ear like a snuggly pillow , pick these up today .
i love these headphones and have been using them for years
my kids ( 8 and 10 ) discovered them and now won not use any others
they are very comfortable and block out outside sounds when you are using them
only downside is that they aren not very durable , but koss give a lifetime warranty on them and you just have to pay for shipping to get them replaced .
i have purchased about <NUM> sets of these over the past few years
i keep them everywhere - car , pc bag , desk , gym bag
they last forever , they fit snugly , they are great on the plane because they block the noise - and the price is terrific
unlike other "sit in the ear" products , these stay
i ever wear them while riding the lawnmower , with big ear protector headphones over them , and it makes the work go faster and not seem like work .
i bought these because my wife has trouble getting regular earbuds to stay put when she goes jogging
for the most part , they fit nice , but you have to know how to insert them properly
i roll them between my thumb and finger so that they are long as skinny , then insert them into my ear and wait for them to expand
just like putting in foam earplugs
for me , they fit well , and seem like they'd stay in better than the earbuds
it is a shame they sound like a hallmark musical greeting card playing inside a tin coffee can
these are bargain basement earbuds , so i certainly wasn not expecting them to sound like sennheiser headphones , but i did expect them to at least match the sound quality of my earbuds that i got for like a dollar and a half on some chinese *ahem* "extreme deal" website
they don not
the bass is just
for something that isolates the air inside your ear canal , bass should be its strong point .
these earbuds are the solution to all of your travel needs
lets face it , public or commercial transportation is not known for its quiet atmosphere
i am sure you will agree that you are always trying to raise the volume high enough to drown out the background noise , but the headphones just can not do it
the koss plug is the answer
i spent <NUM> years in the air force and i have gone through three sets of these
these are the only headphones that i could use while riding on military cargo planes without wearing ear plugs and without cranking the volume to max
ever time i thought i found something better , they never could reach the level of noise isolation that the koss plugs provide
the bass level is superior to every budget or midrange priced similar devices
if you don not mind wearing ear plugs , these are perfect for you
if you don not like wearing ear plugs , get over it ; these plugs are worth the the annoyance .
the sound of it is ok but , the fit is terrible after a while of use they starting to hurt and itching inside the canal ear .
just bought these - they isolate sound , have very good , are comfortable and stay in my ear ( most ear buds fall out )
i also bought a pair of the coby cve92 ear buds because i thought they'd fit as well
sure enough they do , but they sound terrible in comparison
in addition , these have a lifetime "no questions asked" warranty - that is gold , my friend .
although it costs twice as much in us funds , i am very satisfied
my first pair had a button to stop sounds and extra plugs plus a case
it broke two months after , since i tied it to make it shorter
one side wasn not functionning well because of that
i used it in the plane and it blocked <PERCENT> of the engine noise ! economy class really spikes your ears so they should sell these in airports
also the plastic dried up ( i don not know why ! )
my tip : never tie the wires ! it causes the metalic wires inside to break
because of this , it costs me hundreds of dollars
my second set was simpler , but at the same price as my first
no more annoying button to stop music
the tube that you see when you removed the plugs was mostly rubber ( unlike totaly in plastic ) so it is improved
the extra plugs where all different sshapes and sizes so there are some that i can not use
the main problem is that sometimes i sleep on my side while wearing them and the plug breaks
second tip : i have two versions , blue/yellow and purple/gray
what you get in the package is sorta different so choose carefully ! the mute button can be easily pressed
so it is a small hint
third tip : if it doesn not fit , change the plugs or turn and push it in your ear
it doesn not really fit when only pushed
fourh tip : smaller plugs are better for best sound proof and quality
finally : the plugs with break down , piece by piece , until it doesn not fit if you unplug and plug them often
the mute button was meant for that if it helps you purchase
i will only buy these kind of earphones since it is like plugging your ears with rubber corks and istening to music at the same time
the price in canada is kinda steep
if you buy it here you save <PERCENT> ( with the currency and taxes ) !
i bought these because of the isolation feature
i needed some earplugs because riding in a helicopter is just boring without music
i can ride in a blackhawk or chinook and listen to these at a comfortable volume , without hearing too much of the engine noise
a very minor thing is if you use these while running you will hear yourself breathe a little louder than normal
its semi annoying , but im used to it now
would definately recommend for the price and quality .
for the price you pay these are pretty good headphones
fit better than most in your ears and last forever
not the best you will find but for listening to books or music on walks or traveling they work perfect .
been using these ear plugs for may years - and i like them
good sound , inexpensive and they stay in my ears and block external sounds quite well
biggest complaint - the cord - rather the rubber used
if they would upgrade the cord ( to something more like the ipod headphones ) this would be great
the cord has &<HASHTAG> ; memory&<HASHTAG> ; for curls , bends , etc
won not stay straight
just a bit annoying ! different productions have either straight or <NUM> degree phone jacks
i have had both
the <NUM> degree version seems more relaible
only one oddity - different productions seem to have different sounding driver frequency responses
some of them seem to be overly bright ( in treble ) others seem to be heavy in the bass
i just wish they were consistant .
definitely not , but good enough for the average person
at such a low price i have an extra pair on hand in case my kids break one of theirs , so we have a total of <NUM> sets in the house
if you want audiophile quality , you will need to pay a lot more , but at less than $20 , these deliver decent sound and i don not get sick every time i step on one or break a wire
for sound i'd rate them <NUM> stars , for durability i'd give them <NUM> stars , and price is a 5 .
i ordered these because my very favorite earbuds broke and needed a cheap pair untill they are fixed
you get what you pay for
not comfortable and they have a feedback
airbuds makes a pair called , &<HASHTAG> ; the most comfortable earbuds&<HASHTAG> ; , well , they are and have fantastic sound !
i like how the foam plugs conform to your ear , but if you want them in tight - like for running - and you don not get them wedged in just right , the foam will squeeze shut and block the sound .
update - i have stopped using this product and switched to a similar skull candy product
i used koss for years and was a loyal customer
i kept having these break , at a rate of about one a month , and i was gentle with them ! i think the company has seriously cut back on quality
i liked the sound and foam sound blocking , but reliability became a problem
original reviewi have owned several sets of earbuds and these are just great especially and truly when you consider you can get these for well under $20
for me the biggest issue with any ear bud or portable headphone is they let in far too much noise
you can spend a bazillion dollars on a set of snazzy phones , but if there is a baby crying next to you , well you are sound experience is going to be less than ideal
for a city denizen like me , common noise pollution is subway trains , sirens , chatty cell phone blatherers etc
airplanes are another problem for portables because of noise
the plug , by blocking outside noise so effectively , solves this problem
another bonus you don not see often is that koss backs all their products with a lifetime warranty
send them a check for $6 to cover shipping and they will fix or replace your plugs , even if you don not have a receipt ! the plug is big sound in a very portable package
i am hooked .
try to get the metallic silver and purple in color koss plug earbuds as the sound is phenomenal for the price
i had a fairly expensive pair of sony earbuds that were around $40
00 and one channel crapped out after about <NUM> months
hard to believe , but the koss plug earbuds sound way better then the more costly sony
go figure
for the price and the sound , these earbuds can not be beat
good going koss .
these are great little headphones for the price
they are just like foam earplugs
there is a proper way to squish and insert earplugs , believe it or not
most people just press a couple times without any thought and shove
you have to "roll" these between your fingertips really well , evenly , over and over
if you don not , they will expand too fast and you will have trouble , especially when new
the more you use them , the better they get until the foam finally breaks down and you go to the replacement foam
i only use these when traveling and they knock down the noise down from planes , considerably
these are your best bet for the money
ignore the reviewers that state that their double and triple priced headphone are better
duh ! what would you expect ! if you buy a car for 10 , 000 don not expect 20 , 000 or 30 , 000 dollar features and performance
someone actually compared these to <NUM> dollar shure headphones ! also , any , pretentious , audiophile that buys these for <NUM> bucks and expects audiophile performance is just being ridiculous
come back to earth , please
i have used these on all forms of media and have yet to be disappointed
they will definitely show the flaws in any recordings because the sound is isolated and aimed directly at your eardrum
this is one reason i would never give it to a little kid
if you like to save space on your ipod and go with a low quality setting , your mistake will be painfully obvious
it will also be painfully obvious when you listen to the some of the cheap/low quality recordings and incompetent audio engineers of late
these will not fit everybody is ears on the entire planet !
i bought these to knock out some of the noise from a busy 35mph street i walk next to for my walking commute
i carefully squished the pads and let them expand in my ears forming a fairly high pressure seal
they maybe take a couple db off the road noise , barely taking the edge off
i can drop down the volume a notch or two from where i would with my other open air koss headphones
but that is more because there is a tube shooting the music into your ears
sound is not up to my other cheap koss headphones
and the wires could literally not be any thinner or more delicate
i bought these koss because i like my other cheap koss &<HASHTAG> ; &<HASHTAG> ; headphones so much and the cord was nice and beefy on those
i tried someones suggestion of replacing the pads with official ear plugs , trimmed to length and a hole punched through
that helped a tiny bit more
noise leak seems to be right through the headphone itself
if you try to replace the pads , i suggest , scissors , a heated ice pick , pointy chopsticks , and lots of patience .
better than i could have hoped
they are comfortable , sound great and are an incredible deal from one of the best names in sound
makes my ipod touch the music machine i always wanted .
here is the good stuff : great isolation from outside noise , comfortable , damned near excellent bass , and very power efficient
but i am returning my pair to tower records where i just bought them for $15
why ? because the sound itself is truly awful : compressed , dead , flat , hazy , and tinny ( the great bass notwithstanding )
these 'phones literally suck the life out of my music , by destroying its dynamics , detail , rhythm , tonal accuracy , and high frequencies , and then layering a harsh fuzziness on top of that
i can not say enough bad things about the actual sound
i suspect you can have a more rewarding musical experience at your dentist is office
i know i did .
i like : - quality sound
i do not like : - easily drop of my ears- i have to squeeze hard to fix the ear and it bothers .
these headphones to me are my favorite , after you get used to squeezing them and setting them up correctly in your ear
they reduce outside noise and sound great with bass
plus when you workout or mow the lawn you dont have to turn up your music as loud with other headphones , this is very nice with big yards and helps keep your hearing from getting damaged .
for $15 , by far the best choice for portable applications , particularly when there is a moderate level of ambient noise
excellent for walkman or mp3 player use at the gym ; they block enough sound so that i can hear the music , but i can still hear if someone is talking to me ( although i have to remove at least one of the plugs in order to hear what they are saying )
be sure to save the spare ear foam pieces - you will probably need them eventually , since they don not fit as well after they soften up too much .
these really are fine headphones , particularly for use inside a motorcycle helmet
but they are cheaply made compared to , for example , the headphones bundled in an ipod
the wiring insulation is a little sticky and gets tangled easily , and the wires themselves are and skinny
edit : ok , after months of use , the plug headphones just keep holding up for dozens and dozens of motorcycle trips
my earlier accusations of flimsiness were obviously ; these $14 headphones are a fantastic deal and they outlasted my ipod original headphones
edit 2 : i finally beat the heck out of these headphones and decided to replace them after about 1
5 years of wearing a motorcycle helmet over them
overall a very good value for the money
the new headphones work just as well , except that koss has replaced the smooth pvc wire insulation with some new stuff that has a roughened , sticky texture
and it does stick , to itself and to everything else , making them slightly less functional .
i like these , they sound good , are priced reasonable , block out all other sound
my only complaint is that i cant find the soft replacement ear buds
i have purchased ones that are said to be replacements but they seem harder & are not as easy to roll
think i will need to buy a new pair in order to get the soft ones .
the ear buds make nice ear plugs
i wear them at work to block out noise
sound quality is good but not the best
they came with <NUM> different sized buds
i think they are a good value for the price .
in no means are these headphones studio quality
these are for the person on the go and no i don not mean running
the foam snuggles fits in the ear canal and does do a very good job a cancelling out noise
the base is okay , but you can always get a mini amp to create more bass or go into a devices settings to increase it
i did this on my iphone 3gs and i was please with the results
other than that it is a neat little accessory for my music taste .
i thought these would be a good travel idea , to block out external noise
that they do , in a small , cheap package
for that , they get a <NUM> instead of a 1
the bass that is trumpeted by the marketing is certainly there as well
but it simply sounded "thuddy and muddy" - we are talking quantity over quality in the bass department
in fact , these are probably the worst sounding headphones i have ever used
in the end , i preferred putting up with outside noise in my other phones ( a sony pair ) than listening to these
i also found them quite uncomfortable to wear for extended periods , but that can be a highly personal thing
all in all , the best part of these was taking them out .
just as expected
made from cheap materials but an okay product
so far so good ! perfect volume control ! i highly recommend it !
works great for metal detectors that don not have volume control
i was looking to control the volume out of my samsung un40eh6030 , which has a fixed volume output out of the 3
5mm jack
i wanted to used headphones when watching blurays or playing 360 , so i got one of these instead of an expensive amplifier
works beautifully ; no noise and the volume is sufficient
excellent product for this type of use .
the product works as advertised , and is very simple to use
i am using it to control the volume on an external speaker connected to a spirit box for use in investigations for my paranormal research group .
doesn not have much range
this definitely decreased the volume in my headphones
it works as a volume control but it shouldn not decrease the volume to do so .
and when you need a volume control ( down only ) in a 3
5mm format , this one works fine
it is not an amp , just a volume control .
whereas this device will allow you to adjust the volume , the range is limited from no sound to the volume you'd have without it
i had gotten the [apparently mistaken] impression that it would boost the volume for headphones which had low volume for some sources ( like zune , ipod ) , but that does not appear to be the case
since you can always lower the volume on the source ( mp3 player , etc
) , i am having a hard time seeing the value of this device - except that in some cases it might be handier to have an inline control .
it worked fine for a few months but now the sound coming out is really fuzzy in other words it is ready for the garbage
hold on
ok it is now in the garbage can
btw i never moved this around at all
good thing i waited to review this .
i just got these today and so far they are exactly what i wanted
i have read some reviews about the sound quality being bad when you turn it down low
honestly , if your turning your music down that low then your obviously tyring to pay attention to other things
i tried my headphones with the controller on and off and i don not hear a difference
it is a delicate thing
very light
my only complaint is that i wish the volume control wheel was a little longer but it is something i can easily deal with
i will update in a few months or if something happens .
works as advertised , well worth money spent koss makes great products for the home or car , so if you want or need a volume control then this one is for you !
the volume controller is reasonably well designed ; no crackling drop out of volume , or other distortion during use
it is ergonomics allow it to feel good in either hand
the connecting cord is to short and the quality of the wire feels cheap
this product was a recent purchase , so i can not comment on longevity .
the koss vc <NUM> volume control works well
however it is cheaply made & if you start to leave the room without removing your headphones you might find yourself needing a new volume control
spend a little more & get one that is not so flimsy
again to it`s credit the device what it was designed for .
i bought this in order to inexpensively kill the agc of my video capture card
when the volume was lowered closer to where it was barely audible , there was lots of crackling and distortion
upon examining its audio waveform at the lower settings , the negative phase of both channels was becoming increasingly truncated/clipped
depending on what it is connected to , it is good for slightly controlling the volume ; however , look into using an amp , instead , for maximum volume control .
this is a lifesaver for using headphones with my dell d610 laptop which boasts an extremely noisy headphone jack with lots of interference at low volumes
using this volume control , i can turn up the volume on the dell to overpower the static while keeping the volume of the music in my ears low
the control is even less sexy than the picture on the website , if that is possible
it also doesn not work great for an extremely loud source ( like my dell port replicator is line out port ) , because the sound from the volume control doesn not seem to be output equally in both ears at low levels .
all i wanted was a simple slider device to adjust volume so i wouldn not have to keep pulling the ipod out of my pocket at starbucks to adjust the volume on the unit
mostly this has very little ability to increase sound
very good at lowering the sound
i guess that makes sense
if i turn up the ipod volume to the max , then i turn the koss down to get to the level i want it works ok
actually i wanted something more like my sennheisers where i can adjust the volume either way
another waste of my funds
too inexpensive to return
too useless to keep
you can buy this one at the goodwill store next week .
i bought this so that i could easily control the volume on my ipod touch during bike rides and it does the job perfectly .
i connected the speakers in my hot tub to my computer so i needed a volume control at the hot tub - works perfectly !
i have had four different volumen controls
two on the earplugs , and two on a seperate controls like the koss vc20
this is deffinately the easiest access volume control i have used
you do not have to search to find the volume control
it is a simple roll knob that is easy to find
note , that if you care , this is not an l shaped plug as shown in the product image
i might mention , i am not that concerned about high quality
i only use the mine to listen to audio books , which this seems to be fine for so far
but will get some tough use
i broke the last two earphones ( quite expensive ones ) at the plug , and decided breaking a volume control would be cheaper
i broke that as well
i thought i would try an "l" plug connection
i failed to notice the photo of the notes from deepanker at the top which shows this is a straight line plug
i will see how this one goes
koss vc20 volume control
works great and i am glad i got this with the purchase of my new ath anc7 headphones .
construction isn not that heavy duty , but if you want to reduce the output of electronic , stereo devices to match the input of what you are connecting it to - it works
price was right and is convenient for my purposes
i recommend it - all things considered .
the product works as advertized
the adjustment wheel is fine enough that the volume can be tuned in very precisely
the wheel is recessed below the side surface of the body to avoid accidentally adjusting the volume and protect the wheel from damage
the cord is perhaps thinner than i would have expected but should be ok
the body of the device is very light plastic but seems rugged enough
if the product proves to be durable i will change my rating to a 5
i recently updated the review to a <NUM> star rating
i have had no issues with this adapter .
i loved this when i had it but i unfortunately lost it when i was out one day
i primarily used it to make my headphones at the time longer so i could lay down in bed and watch tv
it did not affect the volume or quality
i also used it to make my earbuds longer while i was on the go , i primarily use public transportation , so i could put my mp3 player in my bag and simply use the volume control as needed since i would clip that part to my pants or my bag
i plan on getting a replacement .
i purchased this item with a new pair of headphones for my wife and i to use with our laptop
the koss volume control does exactly what it is supposed to and is a handy convenience to adjust volume quickly and easily
i didn not notice any signal degradation as a result of having the volume control plugged with the headphones
if you need a little extra cord length then that would be an added benefit
my wife absolutely loves the convenience but i have concluded i could just as easily live without it
should you buy it ? just answer three questions and you will have your final answer
1 ) would you prefer a little extra cord length ? 2 ) in everyday headphone use , do you find yourself frequently adjusting the volume ? 3 ) do you have the extra cash to burn ? my wife answered yes to all three while i answered no
did we keep it ? you know what they say , happy wife , happy life
: )
these work fine but have a short working lifespan
i have owned two vc20 is and both stopped working in stereo , then altogether
they were used only for listening in bed so they were not abused
i liked the volume control but would like to see them better made , even at a higher price .
this is my second one , i could never get my first one from my wife so i needed to buy one for myself , it works well and is relatively inexpensive
it is a great buy for the money and i have had several other koss products before and alway been very satisfied with them
i would have liked to see a larger dial that offers more levels , but if you need a simple volume control than this is the one .
this is a perfect companion piece for my f11 dock and bluetooth transmitter/receiver for my ipod
allows me to control the volume at the mobile end of the
clip on back allows me to keep it handy
my only complaint is the small size of the volume control wheel
it could stand to be larger and have some sort of tactile method of adjusting the volume before pressing play .
i have one of these between my carpc and amp input
the soundcard was putting out to much power , turning the volume up to <NUM> out of <NUM> on the pc would almost blow the speakers
this thing was the quick and easy fix to give a little more breathing room to the pc volume
i haven not noticed any sound quality loss though i dont have the nicest of speakers to notice fine detail .
this volume control can be used in several situations
as a wearable , it has a clip ( like on a pen ) so you can attach it to a pocket , sleeve or collar so it won not be flopping around like a cord mounted control
in my case i used a small piece of double sided tape to inconspicuously mount it to the side of a table next to my chair to control the volume of the earbuds i wear while watching tv
the volume control range is from full off to full on and there is no static when operating the control and no distortion in sound quality at any setting
my only very minor complaint is that the control wheel is a bit too recessed so you have to only use the tip of your finger
that is probably a plus if you are wearing it as it is less likely to be moved by just brushing against it
it is well worth the price and i would buy it again
i typically have my ipod in a leather case , tucked in my pocket , and i don not want to have to dig it out when i want to adjust the volume
this device is a practical & inexpensive solution to that function .
i have the controller on the outside of my motorcycle helmet
it is hooked up it a pyle headphone amp and xpro speakers
absolutely no issues with this controller
it would even work great if i was an idiot and was doing 100+ on my bike , but i would never do that
; )
i would like the volume wheel to be bigger or stick out more , so it would be easier to use
the plug is straight , not l shaped as shown in the current picture
the cord is <NUM> inches
i use this with my mp3 player because i am trying to minimize wear and tear on my old player and i don not like my panasonic headphone volume control slider thing
i didn not want the thin metal pocket/belt clip , but fortunately i was able to pull it off with some thin pliers .
i initially used the koss volume control inline with headphones , in order to listen to the tv late at night , without disturbing others
we have a 5
1 speaker system , controlled by one speaker volume knob ( no remote control )
it is wired from the tv to a 1/8" y/duplex plug ; one line continues to the speakers , the other goes to the headphones
turn the speakers down all the way , and you only hear it through the headphones
ok so far
but , guess what happens when you have the speakers up halfway , with the headphones plugged in , and you change the volume on the headphone using the koss volume control ? the volume of the external speakers changes ! huh ? how is that possible ? it was odd at first , but if you lowered the koss unit is volume , the speaker is volume went up
raise the koss volume , the speaker is volume went down
it is something to do with the amount of signal strength going to the headphones that sucks it from the 5
1 speakers
i had to add a label "loud" and "soft" , mounted just the opposite of the volume legend near the control wheel , since it controlled the speakers opposite of what you'd think
so the koss volume control can function as a wired speaker volume control as well , provided that headphones are wired in parallel to the speakers
who knew ? p
i like it so much , i am buying another .
performs as advertised
some people have noted a drop in audio quality , but to a person with average ears such as mine , your audio should sound almost exactly the same
the price is definitely fair
the one problem i have encountered so far is that the volume dial is recessed from the side , so i have to use my fingernail to turn it
but it is only a minor annoyance since the product works .
this review is for the koss volume control only
a volume control that i can reach anytime , and it works
a volume control for all devices , and it has the 3
the control includes a clip to attach it to any clothing , too
this is the best separate volume control i have found
i use it with my headphones , and control volume on all my devices with it
it makes changing the volume very easy
mine did come with a straight plug on the end , instead of the angled plug as shown in the image
this volume control worked better than i expected
i can now control the volume on each device i use with the same control
instead of trying to remember all the volume controls and where they are , i plug this into my headphones and use it with everything
other than the plug being straight , there were no surprises
having tried many volume controls , both separate and integrated , i found this one very easy to use
it is much better than most of the controls out there
set the volume up fairly loud , and then use this to control it as needed
it works great .
purchased to be used to adjust the volume of my pro 4aat phones while snoozing at night , the tiny volume control , no balance , and flimsy construction make these useless for me
at $10 , not worth the hassle of returning
koss should not put their name on such a piece of junk
next time , i will pay more and buy something better .
it was bought in case i had issues hearing from a pair of earbuds that i bought and it works great .
this product is great
when my wife & i both want to share a wired connection to an audio source , i don not have to have her continually telling me to turn it down
it is too loud
i bought this for her to turn her is down while i enjoy it at a level i can hear
too many years of loud music and loud guns with no hearing protection
sometimes , it is not always &<HASHTAG> ; convenient&<HASHTAG> ; to used hearing protection
they didn not have those back in the day and a lot of us older have lost significant hearing as a result .
i use headphones at night to watch tv and this helps because i can clip it to my pj is & adjust the sound level , on our 'me' tv channel the commercials are at a higher sound level then the show even though there is now a federal law against this practice
the wheel that makes the adjustment is very touchy , takes some practice to get used to it , so it lost a star because of that .
if you have a device that allows for headphones , but doesn not have a volume adjustment , this is for you
i have been using this to "tone down" the audio that is sent from my xbox 360 is audio dongle
the volume control has lasted well since the purchase , with no visible signs of wear , in spite of being used while traveling
also , the sound quality is pretty good , with no detectable leakage
i would greatly recommend this .
i have a koss pro/4 a plus headset that delivers incredible sound reproduction , but doesn not have an inline volume control
i was considering ordering another headset with inline volume control , but was reluctant to do so because of the quality of my current pro/4 is
searched on amazon and found this koss vc20 volume control which is the perfect companion to my headset
as one of the other reviewers rightly stated , this device in not an amplifier
therefore please note the following : one has to turn up the sound on the output device ( an imac in my case ) , connect the vc <NUM> volume control to this device , connect the headset to the the vc <NUM> and then adjust the sound to one is liking
very simple to do
this makes for a superb listening experience
works on a computer , ipad , iphone , etc
, and can be used if jogging , exercising or just walking
i have been a fan of koss for years because of the quality of their products
this volume control carries on their commitment of making quality products
very pleased .
it does what you would think it would ; nothing more and/ or less
as far as i can hear ( i used a pair of audio technica is plugged into a focusrite scarlett 2i2 [studio quality ] ) there is no loss in sound quality
i initially just needed an extension to prevent exerting too much tension on a heavy headphone cable
however , i figured being able to adjust the volume with an analog control would be a nice bonus
and it is ! it does it is job and at that it does it simply and wonderfully
( edit : after a while of use i noticed that it subdues the highs , lows , and even at the highest volume it is slightly quieter than without it
still a good buy though ! )
this works well but maybe i am short ; well no maybe , but the wires for this are so long it detracts a little from the enjoyment end up bundling them together
main thing is they work well .
good quality , no impact on audio quality
the wheel is small and recessed
maybe it was designed like this to prevent inadvertent movement if the device is in a pocket , etc
but it kinda defeats the purpose of having an inline control if you are gonna stick it in your pocket
anyway , the a larger wheel or more open access would be an improvement .
i bought this to be able to control audio volume
similar devices of other brands/no brands purchased in the past all just disintegrated ; koss is built much better and so far so good
no complaints .
i bought this to control the volume of my m50 headphones ( which have no volume control )
the headphones are very loud when plugged directly into the computer when the system volume is any higher than <PERCENT> , so having a mechanical limiter like the vc20 is essential
so far i have no real complaints
initially i was skeptical about the thin dial , but i have grown to like it - it is easy to find by feel in the dark , but difficult to bump accidentally
the plug end is a little skimpy , but since the control will live by my computer i am not worried about durability
i can not give a scientific opinion about the sound quality - i am sure there is some quality loss introduced by putting this device between the source and the headphones , but i am unable to discern a difference
the sound coming from my m50 is is still very nice ! i wish it had a mute button , but for the price i can not complain
: - )
simple volume control
works as its supposed too which is all we can ask
no issues with it at this time .
this allows me to control the volume on my head phone instead of have to use the mouse on the laptop
i like it alot
is also used when hooked up to the headphones for the tv or the mp3 player
very convenient
works great .
use headphones with the speaker output on my tv
there is no volume control on that output
added this inline before my headphones
works perfect .
if you have a television that does not give you variable output to headphones , this is what you need
it words simply said , better then i thought !
digital portable radios drive me crazy with the huge change in volume that comes with one unit of volume increase/decrease
i use this to adjust radio volume through headphones in a more useful way
all is well .
i often buy headphones with volume control
but the brand and style i really like is no longer available
i discovered this volume control , realized it would work with any standard headphones using a 1/8 inch plug and i couldn not be happier
if i need extra cord length for my phones , this gives it
and i will always prefer a hardware volume control to a software one
it is just so much quicker and easier to deal with .
i bought this and used it for a few weeks before it just died
no reason , no drops or bumps
it just quit working
i requested a replacement , because i really liked it while it worked
the returns process was quite easy and i didn not have to pay to ship it back
overall , still a positive experience .
bought this because my earphones had no volume
it does what is says it will
my one complaint was that is can only decrease the volume , not increase it .
i use it with zoom h1 portable recorder , i had a serious issue with zoom that its intake level is very hot !
so whne you get a line out from a mixer , you have no way to control the input gain ! this is perfect for that
also it is very clean sound !
definitely worth getting
comes in handy when you can not control the volume what you are listening to , as you would expect .
works great
can not say much else about this product other than write filler words so i can hit the submit button ( got it ) .
what can one say about this simple , but much needed accessory ? -koss vc20 volume one i have ever used
ever use an accessory rotary volume control ( if you can find one ) ? they usually work for a week , get a speck of dust inside , then become choppy or silent ! most headphones are furnished with a rotary volume control , the better headsets , of course , usually have the better quality control
however the controls drop dead , just before the headphones do
i mow acres & acres of lawns all season of dust & pollen
i use the koss vc20 every day ( going on two years ) ! if it gets dirty , a tiny squirt of it springs right back ! amazing durability from an $8
19 component !
for my use it is perfect
i just have my speaker set to the max volume ( because its broken ) and i control my volume with this , i love it although that shipping thing threw me off
- would have liked to know from the start thank you very much .
this item is an inexpensive handy item to adjust the volume on your ipod , etc without using the control of the ipod
however , this is not an amplifier , but a vclume control only
when i plugged in my stereo headphones i got nothing
i found i had to pull the plug out about half way and jiggle it around to make any contact
then i got mono sound
think someone installed the wrong jack during manufacture
got a different brand elsewhere that works fine .
wonderful , very useful ! my old portable radio and hardly responds to the volume control and i have returned to this attachment to use with headphones and volume control again .
this product does what it is supposed to do
i have occasionally noticed that the connection isn not perfect , but mine is been banged around a lot and dragged on the floor of my study
i have always been able to get rid of any connection problems by just ensuring that the my phones are plugged in tight
this product comes in handy .
i used this to control the volume of a 2
1 speaker system
however it does not control it properly
the sound gets switched between speakers sometimes
other times it just does not reduce the volume
havent tried it with a headphone though .
as the night wore on the fm became static ridden
i followed earlier reviews , popped the cover ( 3 screws ) and the vr2 about 1/4th turn
the signal improved dynamically and the static was gone !
feels pretty darn cheap and the cable is frighteningly thin but i have had this thing for years and have not been particularly nice to it and it still works .
it is a good unit and does what it is supposed to do , but the sound passing through loses some quality
seems slightly distorted or missing some of the sound ranges .
the koss vc20 volume control works very well
at very low volume ( ( i would say less than <PERCENT> of max
) it gives sound only in the left canal , but that is really not a problem
i didn not notice any sound distortion otherwise
it has a small metal clip which can be &<HASHTAG> ; removed&<HASHTAG> ; ( i
torn off ) for the users who might find it problematic .
just exactly what i was looking for
satellite box audio output was and very loud
this fixed the problem .
does exactly what it should
i use it with a blue tooth receiver to work as wireless headphones with a set of ear buds
no noise on changing volume levels , long lasting ( wear at night , so subject to toss and turn )
the variable resistor must be of some quality in that it hasn not started making noise yet
( most cheap volume controls ( potentiometers ) , start making noise after a short while ) .
i already have two "no name" inline volume controls , but i needed another
this koss unit was no more expensive from amazon than another "no name" from an electronics store , and i have been a big fan of koss since the late 70s , so i bought it
first , what it is and isn not
this is a volume control , but not an amplifier
it will make your mp3 player , etc
, quieter , but not louder
if your source is too quiet , look for a headphone amplifier
when i used to listen to a cassette walkman it was easy to turn down the volume when i needed to
the volume control was a thumbwheel right on the player
i have several mp3 players now , and they all have context sensitive controls
this means ( for me , anyway ) that i have to look at the screen to make sure the button or slide control is set for volume
this control solves that problem
set the player for a volume slightly on the loud side and use the inline control to get comfortable sound
if you need to lower the volume ( to talk to someone , for instance ) you can use the volume control without taking your player out of your pocket
this model has a three foot cord between the player and the volume control
this is nice if your player has an fm tuner -- mp3 players use the headphone cord as an fm antenna
my generic ones were only about <NUM> inches long and the fm reception suffered
the control has a clip on it , so you can wear your player safely in a padded pouch on your belt and clip the volume control to your chest pocket
a few reviewers have noted that lowering the volume attenuates high frequencies
i tried using the eq settings on my player ( i was also using koss portapro headphones )
when i had bass boost eq settings i did notice some high frequency attenuation in both the koss and generic inline volume controls ; when the eq was turned off i didn not notice as much high frequency attenuation , but the sound was very "flat
" anyway , i don not think i would have noticed it if other reviewers hadn not pointed it out
an inline volume control is very handy for portable mp3 players , etc
, and this unit is well thought out , and works great .
it worked quite nicely for a few months , but then the sound started cutting out
will buy again , as it is the only product i have found to add volume control to headphones for any device , not just iphones ( which i don not have or like ) also , $10 times a year is definitely worth the convenience in my mind
this is something you probably won not fully appreciate until you have had one for a while and then lose it
you may not need a headphone extension cord with an inline volume control
but once you get used to having one , you will find the convenience and functionality are habit forming
the one i lost was in daily use for <NUM> or <NUM> years and continued to work well .
i bought this to hopefully remove a very audible hissing sound from an htc evo v phone
the hiss could be heard easily when i was playing mp3 files regardless of which pair of earbuds i used
i inserted my earbud plug into the the koss vc20 and then plugged the vc20 into my phone
after turning the volume on my phone up and the volume on the vc20 down , i was thrilled to find that the hiss was no longer audible
i noticed no degradation in sound quality ( same bass and treble levels , for example ) when using the vc20 versus not using it
the gadget is lightweight and offers excellent control over sound volume
well worth the price !
this handy audio extension really helps while watching videos on the kindle fire
offers an external volume control
highly recommend this koss unit to anyone who has noticed the modest volume output for the kindle fire
this is smaller than my earbuds when both are wrapped up .
does a good job at attenuating the sound out of my phone
my android has a bug where the media volume resets to max anytime a notification sounds
this lets me set the media to max and then turn it down to comfortable
i have very good earphones , and haven not noticed any sound issues
the cord is flimsy feeling and quite long , so i have just kept it tied in a bundle
we will have to see about its longevity .
i listen to my tv once in a while using my bose qc15 headphones
the problem with that set up is that volume cannot be adjusted and plays at full blast
the koss vc20 volume control module mitigated that issue
works as described .
koss should change the name of this unit to the clarity eliminator
that is exactly what it does when you try to turn the volume down
all the clarity / treble disappears leaving a barely understandable muffled sound
i tried it with brand new koss ur40 headphones plugged into the tape monitor jack on a tdk dual tape deck
by themselves , the headphones have only fair quality and are way too loud
add the vc20 and the muffled sound makes the headphones with volume control totally useless
if you need a volume control for headphones do not buy this one
either buy some other one or buy headphones with a volume control , such as the koss ur29 .
the connection between the headphones and the volume control doesn not seem to be too great
while adjusting the volume using the koss volume control , one or both ear buds will stop working until i hit a &<HASHTAG> ; sweet spot&<HASHTAG> ; on the volume dial .
feels and looks cheap
it seems to work ok but sometimes you want a product for more than just functionality
its a little embarrassing using this ugly thing when i really like the look and feel of my headphones .
this is a surprisingly useful gadget , as it serves as an extension cord and volume control
the extension cord aspect adds about <NUM> feet to your headphone , which gives me a lot more room to move when i am listening to music on my computer
the volume control is handy when using a portable player because you can change the volume without jostling the player .
i use a radio to put me to sleep at night
i plug a pillow speaker into my radio or smartphone to listen to talk radio
it is a lot easier to control the volume with this that waking up my smart phone and using the volume control on it .
my wife watches a lot more tv , often using headphones so that i can avoid the incessant prattle of tv
this allows her to control her earphones that are powered by the tv audio output
( the audio output is always on , but doesn not have a volume control
economical way to make any headphones volume controllable
works great and delivery was swift
although it is compact , it seems sturdy enough to last for years .
if you have audio equipment that doesn not have a volume control
for some odd reason , then this does the trick to fix that problem .
if you want a buffer between you and the audio source , get this product
well made and it will save your hearing .
the koss vc20 volume controller really does what it is suppose to
not really much else to say about it , honestly .
this product gets three stars for being the exact product i needed
i couldn not find any other offerings for a headphone extension with potentiometer volume controls
it loses two stars for how it crackled and had a poor connection almost as soon as i got it in the mail , due to a low quality cable that easily breaks inside .
product works ok , but the tiny wheel volume control is difficult to turn , i have to use my finger nail to really turn it
other than that i am happy with it
not really a professional volume controller , but it does the job , what do you want for such a cheap price ?
the sound is perfectly fine
i couldn not tell any difference in quality when i had it connected directly or through this volume adjuster
the cord eventually wore out after a lot of abuse
i wish it was stronger .
great item
used for night time sleeping
operation by roller dial , easy and efficient item will buy a second for spare
using inline with my sennheiser headphones
control wheel in cavity of housing , so vol
control won not get accidently turned , and it stays where you set it
good volume range easy to set to right level
cord a bit long , when adding to my already long earphones cord , but i just coil up the volume control extra ! good 1/8" plug fit one end and strain relief on other end at cord
getting another for my koss headphones
clip on it , to affix to like a belt .
i have discovered , as have others , that most modern tvs do not have a simple output jack for headphones
instead they have a limited volume output set of jacks
the sound coming out of them is set pretty low and you cannot increase it using your remote is volume controls ( i guess the manufacturers figure you are going to hook it up to an amp and a theatre sound system , which is not what i wanted to do
) so i heard about this product and it seemed like just the thing i needed to boost volume
it has no power source , so if you set the dial on the unit at maximum volume , it comes to your headphones at exactly the same weak strength as emanates from the tv output jacks
all it can do in reality is turn the sound down
skip it .
this product performs as advertised
i use it to connect a bose quiet comfort headset to my computer for gaming and such to not annoy others nearby
makes it much easier to control the volume with a physical wheel then through windows
not much else to say about it .
it didn not take much use before the volume control stopped responding and the cord began shorting out the audio playback .
i was hoping to get more volume from my tablet with an auxillary conrol , but that was not the case
but , still a good product for extending the length of your speakers .
i purchased this to hook up to my headphones that do not have a line level control
for its purpose it is fine
i am not an audiophile so i cannot comment on how good or bad the sound is
seems fine to me but i have bad hearing anyway
the one i got did not have a curved jack as pictured but rather a straight one , no problem
i use this on my laptop and i have noticed that if i want to reach the louder setting i first have to turn my laptop up to one of the higher settings and then i can go up or down with the koss
overall i think it was a good purchase .
i got this because when we are recording music i dont like it loud in my eadphones and some time freddy p wants it super loud in his ear
this way we can both have it as loud or as low as we want
great deal .
i am using this volume control to operate the volume from a satellite radio to one of the popular mini- mini speakers being sold which do not have volume controls
works just fine .
so i loved the one i purchased for home so much that i purchased another for my headphones at work : ) simple , does what it says and a nice cheap price !
does what it says , works as expected
cord and jack look a little spindly compared to everything else i have , but so far so good
very small and light , making it highly portable if you need it to be
about 30" of reach
i have only had this for a week or so ; well worth the $7 as long as it survives a respectable lifespan
updatei can not remember how long i got out of this , but it wasn not long enough ( a few months )
i really like inline volume controls , but will choose a different one next time
this unit got touchy and created buzzing
look for something with better quality cable/shielding .
a good little tool to have around the house , especially when gaming
i can plug this into the computer then my headphones into it , then adjust the volume from there without having to to change the volume .
i use it at work where i use earphones and this is very handy to lower the volume quickly when someone is talking to me
very useful .
not sturdy but has lasted a year so far without problems
even the cheapie volume control has not created any noise problems
the price is right and this extension can be used with any headset
i think koss will replace the cord free if it goes bad .
the cable feels cheap and it is a thinner cable , but so far i have had no issues
the volume control is good , there is no hiss or distortion when adjusting volume
i am rather picky with audio and i haven not had any issues , there is no interference or sound distortion that i can tell
i highly recommend it .
i have a sole elliptical that has built in speakers and an input for 3
5mm stereo plug
it does not however have a built in audio control
running straight from my roku player to the elliptical was too loud and from the tv too low
this works perfectly connecting my roku player to the elliptical now that i can control the volume .
the volume control dial is way too small and ina depressed area making it hard to use
also , it seemed to have trouble controlling the volume as 2/3rds of the dial did nothing and all the volume control was in the last 1/3rd .
it is cheap !
i know : ) it is ok , works as expected
just don not think it is going to last long , 'cause seems like cheap , light .
koss vc20 volume control unit
does exactly what it says it does , exactly as it expected
no more , no less .
one of the first things i do when i am buying new ear buds is check the cord length
the majority of ear buds these days have cords that are much too short for everyday use often resulting in the ear buds pulling out of your ears or the cord coming unplugged from whatever device you are using
this is where an extension cord/device such as this one is very useful
like many people , i sit at a desk in front of a computer all day , listening to music much of that time
the ipod dock that i have on desk is just far enough away that my ear buds don not quite reach and wearing them isn not practical or comfortable
thus i purchased this item to add some cord length and some extra volume control
here are my thoughts ; pros+ adds approximately 3' in cord length
+ volume control switch is at the end of the cord and has a clip to attach to whatever you are wearing or carrying
cons- sound degradation is extremely noticeable
feels approximately like a 30-<PERCENT> loss of sound because of the extended connection
while i expected some loss i didn not expect quite this much
the volume switch barely raises the overall volume unless you have your device volume at max
- flimsy wiring and weak connections tend to short out quickly if there is moderate or active use
- amazon is stock photo doesn not exactly match the item i received
my model matches the customer image that was submitted so there are slight differences such as the angle of the male end of the plug
could be problematic for some
while this item is useful to me in my particular situation i'd rate it poor overall
it works for me because it will stay at work on my desk and not see any travel use
since i don not listen to my music very loud at work as i need to hear if coworkers are speaking to me , the low volume isn not a huge issue for me
however , if you are looking to purchase an extension for your normal headphones to carry with you this is not the device for you
especially if you are going to be around a lot of noise or people talking ( i
the bus , train , subway etc
if you are going to be in any of those situations you are better off going with a different product .
this koss vc20 in line volume control which i ordered along with a set of koss headphones from the same seller were my opinion ! first off , the volume control "know" is so inset and tiny that i couln not even identify it at first for about <NUM> mminutes
it is difficult to "thumbnail" this volume control to raise and lower the volume
also , i was unable to mute out the sound
i felt that the range of volume was inferior that it afforded me the opportunity to listen to
i did follow instructions about where to put the sources volume ( such as mid to just above middle range ) .
made listening on the head phones much more comfortable and convenient
it is a good addition to the purchase of head phones
i have owned two of these
i love the product till it stops working which it will
mine lasted longer than the <NUM> day warranty but both died within a year
the wires start cutting out without any noticeable exterior damage .
this item works very well and gives provides convenient volume control for headphones , portable speakers , ipods , etc
easy to use , i highly recommend them .
did most of what i wanted
gave me easy to access volume control while i was snowboarding
on the other hand , as soon as i took a tumble the tiny fragile little metal clip bent way out of shape
a good thick one wouldn not have done that
i am knocking off a star for that , since this isn not completely ideal for someone using this for a sports purpose
aside from that , it does work pretty well .
i use this to ad a volume control to my headphones for my computer
it works
what more can i say .
i have a number of headphones that for some reason have no inline volume control
of course , i can always dig my ipod out of my pocket or backpack , but it is not always easy , like this device , which clips to pocket of belt
now i move this minimally priced from headset to headset and wear the pair most comfortable for the situation .
this is a handy and inexpensive little device
a convenient way to "tweak" your volume level
works fine
no complaints
like all headphone cables it doesn not like to be rolled over by chair rollers , stomped on or yanked out of the socket
if you treat it with moderate care , it ought to last for years .
volume control dial is a little small
probably makes so it doesn not adjust in you pocket , however if you have large hands this may be difficult to adjust
worked as expected , at $8 , i thought it was a little overpriced
however now i am able to control my audio volume from tv to my headset ,
this koss is very good one for volume control
there is no noise sound when i adjust volume
i can not distinguish whether i plug my headphone with this koss because it has no effect to my head phone at all
i use hd555 which has <NUM> ohms impedance so i think this koss may reduce some power of my headphone
but not at all
my hd555 still provides great sound
i love it .
nice product
exactly what i was looking for
quality is great , but it does not have any type of pause button on it
it is strictly a volume control only .
my needs were simple , to lengthen the audio cord so i didn not have to worry about how i sat at work , and volume control
i sit at the computer a bit from time to time , and like to stream music
the cord is long enough , about 3ft i believe
the volume control is just that , basically it will not get louder than what the source is putting out , but it means i can adjust it , rather than adjusting the volume on the computer
it does everything it is supposed to , and in a small package
worth the purchase .
i use my new koss "remote volume control" on my desktop computer , in line with my powered speakers
remanufactured harman kardon hk595 2
1 computer speakerswhen i am at the computer , i always have it playing something -- streaming music , news , national petroleum radio , whatever
and the computer has a dozen "virtual" volume controls -- winamp has a few volume controls ; windows has even a few more for adjusting the volume
why should i add the koss ? pros : but , nothing compares in convenience to being able to reach out to a physical volume knob laying on the desk
no mousing required
faster than a mouse or keyboard control
in fact , my keyboard has a dedicated volume control on it , which i used to be impressed by
but it works through windows , so sometimes its action is delayed after i hit it , and then it starts moving at some arbitrary speed when i hold the button down
so it is a minor challenge to make quick , delicate adjustments
the tiny knob in the koss has a silky feel to it
i will let you know in a few decades if the physical control ever gets dirty and scratchy
at the loud end of its adjustment range , the control is very gentle and smooth
so if you turn the koss to maximum volume , and adjust all your virtual volume controls so the audio is just a bit loud , then it is easy to use the koss to cut back the volume slightly and make very delicate adjustments around the desired volume setting
of course , the koss can also reduce the volume to zero , smoothly
amazon published another review , the koss' "most critical review , " where the reviewer observed that the audio got muddy when the volume control was turned down to its lowest settings
i wouldn not use it at the lowest settings , anyway , because else you are going to blow your ears off if you turn the koss up towards the high end of its adjustment range
anyway , it seems clear to me that the other reviewer tried compensating for the koss being turned to the low end by turning up other volume controls in his system so that he could hear the audio , and one of those other volume controls was causing distortion
, it wasn not the koss at fault for causing the muddiness , and his star review is erroneous
i can confirm that there is no fidelity change when the control is turned towards its low end
cons : there is a clip on the koss , so you can attach it to your shirt or and use it while you walk your mp3 and your dog
the wire is plenty long enough for that ( my wire is about <NUM> 1/2 feet long ) , but if your desktop computer isn not located on your desktop , the wire might not be long enough for you to reach the volume control -- not unless you add an audio extension cable
and you know , adding more audio plugs and sockets threatens to make more scratchy connections
the wire itself is thin
we are talking the type of wire that has a few wisps of copper for the audio , a few more wisps for the ground , all inside a 1/16 inch diameter plastic sheath
if i treat it gently , it will last a while on my desktop
if i were to take it jogging and toss it around thoughtlessly , it wouldn not last a year
thinking of opening up the housing ( which is glued shut ) and the connection ? those wisps of copper and their tiny connections are very difficult to work with ; good luck
another reviewer mentions that he buys one of these periodically
he blames himself because the wire breaks , periodically
i think some blame should be reserved for the delicate design of a product whose function it is to be used on the run .
not much to write , this is a great addition for those headphones which don not have their own volume control and you don not want to mess with the windows volume or your music player volume
i just put them on high and control the volume through this instead
recommended .
this does the task it is supposed to do
it provides an inline volume control for headsets that do not have one
i realize that many headsets are available that have this built in
however , we have several nice pair of headsets without this feature
rather than replacing expensive headsets , i bought this to make it easier for me to change the volume without fiddling with controls on the computer or ipod .
i ride a scooter ( aka vespa ) and it is inconvenient to reach the volume control of my mp3 player while i am riding , so i decided to buy this and so far i am pleased
i love how i can clip it on my shirt and easily access it
one thing to mention is that it does not amplify sound so it will only go as loud as the music player can go
i believe there is no degradation in sound quality so that is great
overall i'd recommend it based on my experience .
i am using this with a set of cambridge soundworks 2
1 speakers since the original volume control stopped working and they no longer sell replacements
the cable is thin , and of decent length , but it is not that robust , so i don not know how much abuse it can take
i don not know what the circuitry is in on the inside , but for my speakers , i have to have the knob at a very low setting , otherwise the sound volume gets outrageously loud
as a result , unless i have it above a certain level , i only get sound at the appropriate sound level from one channel
if i increase the volume , then both channels sound fine
so that is slightly irritating , but other than that , works well .
i bought this volume control for sports activities
big mistake , it lasted for less than three months , the cable connection to the volume control is broken
the potentiometer that adjusts the volume is a piece of crap too
don not buy this product for sports use .
a gadget that is nice to have
gives an extra length for extension
some static noise when adjusting the volume .
an inline volume control is a great idea - we have used sony headphones in the past that offered this , but the headphone quality was poor
when i saw the koss volume control , i was happy i could get back the control , while still using my high quality 'phones
unfortunately , the max volume with the koss installed is diminished quite a bit
i'd say about <PERCENT> lower than regular headphones alone
another issue is the small size of the slider - i find myself fumbling to find the slider and use it
something with a bit more of a nothumb switch' would be better
i understand you don not want something that can be easily bumped accidentally , but the tiny slider bar this unit currently has is just not adequate
because there is no other options i have found for something like this , i will stick with the koss volume control , but if there were other options , i'd jump in an instant !
these things are always temporary
fortunately my new receiver has a better earphone output , complete with volume control on the tv remote , so i don not need to replace this volume control
nothing wrong with the product , but it wasn not sturdy enough to really last - and nothing else i have tried was either
the designers apparently have never lived with their own products
if they listen to music or tv at all they probably don not use earphones
review by tony
we both use plant lady is amazon account these days
she has never used earphones and knows nothing about the highly technical science of running them off a tv set .
i just needed an extension cable for my sony headphones that had very short wire length ( they connect to my cell phone is hands free cable and that is why they have been made that way ) , but most of the extensions available are at least 3ft in length
this koss vc20 was perfect and i also got the added convenience of a volume control
however , at $8
99 ( what i paid at the time ) they are pricey for what they do
these days you can pretty much buy a cassette/cd walkman for that price ! nevertheless , i am happy with my purchase .
i have had them before
so i knew what i was getting
it is hard to find these at walmart or even better , radio shack .
when you set the volume on your music player , it goes in steps and is hard to get the loudness you want
this helps fine tune your volume to the exact spot you want it ! i really recommend this so you can get the volume you want .
worked just fine but someone stepped on it and it easily broke
i may get another one though
it is very inexpense .
only worked for a short time about <NUM> 1/2 mouths then one side or the other on the headphones kept going off i had to keep playing with it to get it to somewhat work , i got <NUM> of these and the same thing keeps happening
it is very hard to find a good volume control .
i like good quality in the ear speakers but not all of them have the volume control on the wire leads
i bought a set of klipsch in the ear speakers with no volume control
having the inline control is a must for me because i wear them under my ear muff hearing protection when shooting pistol at the conservation club i belong to
so with the noise canceling ear speakers and the hearing protection muffs i need to turn the volume down without pulling out my smart phone when someone is trying to talk to me
they work well and i cannot hear any difference if the ear speakers are directly plugged into my music source or if they are going through the volume control
i would recommend these to anyone that is looking for an in line volume control device .
the volume control works as described and is well made
the only complaint i have is with the long cord
if you need to control the volume of your device at a distance this is the control you should buy
otherwise you will find yourself winding up the excess wire .
the view shows a <NUM> degree jack but the actual product is a normal straight on jack
the normal straight on jack will have stress on it
i bought this because my rca hdtv has a headphone buzz , probably due to proximity to the the light source
if i had it to do over again i would get an led hdtv back light
much less chance of buzzing .
nothing serious
the volume seems no different from when i control it via my phone
the only difference noted is the ability to leave my phone in my pocket
not impressed at all .
i am using this item in line for a set of wired headphones for a tv
the output from the tv is fixed so i needed to have a volume control in line so i could turn down the volume on the tv so i could watch and leave the room quite
this control gave me a couple more feet of length and it works flawlessly
i wouldn not hesitate to recommend it to anyone
i am using the same headphones i use with my ipod
addendum : i have had my volume control for a year now ; and it continues to work very well
i use it everyday , and i have had no problems with it
i saw one reviewer that complained it was hard to use ; i can not imagine how that could be
the control wheel is recessed into the unit , but is easy to use by just sliding your thumb over the wheel
i have found it to be very robust ; once it attached to the end of my headphones the unit reaches to floor ; but it is well made , and has taken a beating with any problems .
i got it because of the l shaped plug in but when it got here it was just the old plain straight plug in
if you use any sort of earphones or earbuds , and you need to extend the length of the cord , and at the same time also control the volume , this little device is something you can use
a true audiophile might have some issue with it , but for general use , this works like a charm
i use one between my computer and my headphones , and it sounds great on games and music alike
i also use one between my earbuds and mp3 player , again , i cannot complain
very cost effective and hard to find something better
note , this will not amplify the sound beyond the volume of the source , but can control it within the range of the signal being sent .
these external headphone or ear bud volume controls are dificult to find
this one works very well
wide range of volume control
note that miniplug is straigt and not angled as shown in photo of product
actually i wanted the straight plug
only wish that the small pocket clip was removeable
minor detail , however .
while not the use most likely intended for this koss device , i purchased it for my mom so she could control the sound from her tv whether to a pair of headphones or a small powered speaker in her lap
it is perfect , and allows her to keep her own personal volume while not having the tv set itself so loud as to blast out the rest of the room
i have also tried it on my ipod , and it is a much more convenient way to trim the volume than fumbling for the touch screen or wheel
i believe the claims on the box to &<HASHTAG> ; boost the volume&<HASHTAG> ; of your personal device may be less than accurate , at least in my case , but it certainly works well enough for the obvious purpose .
bought this for my brother to use on his motorcycle speaker system and it works really good
for this price you can not go wrong with this .
trivial setup , just put it between your headphones and whatever they were plugged into already
works , although i agree with others who have mentioned that the thumbwheel is pretty small .
very good volume controller and very useful , have it on my pc works with any head phones , does the job it was made for and works great .
i got the koss volume control mainly because i listen to books when i walk and the traffic often makes it difficult to hear
being able to just adjust the volume with the koss volume control is much easier than pulling out my ipod or mp3 player to do it
it also conserves the battery by not having to adjust it on the player
this works exactly like it is advertised .
i purchased this volume control simply to give my headphones an extension cord
being able to adjust the volume is an added bonus .
i have a very nice set of stereo headphones which , for reasons i cannot understand , does not include an volume control
i purchased the koss vc20 to insert in the playback circuit when i needed an volume control
the device works perfectly , just as it is supposed to
the only minor drawback is that the notched wheel with which you change the volume setting is rather small and quite sensitive - only a potential disadvantage for folks with large fingers
overall , i am totally satisfied with this product .
after less than a month of being attached to my laptop , the volume control started introducing static , and suddenly it was as if the control was turned all the way down , no matter what i did with the volume wheel .
i think every pair of headphones should have volume control , but a lot of them don not , so this bit of kit is needed
they work just as expected with no degradation to the sound quality .
this volume control is just what i needed to control the volume for headphones i own without a volumecontrol
the control is simple and the volume changing is continuous and smooth .
i have bought two of these , one for myself and another for a gift
i like having the thumb wheel volume control handy to raise and lower volume while watching movies on my pad
it is a very solid product !
this product has been mediocre since the beginning
when adjusting the volume control , the balance alternately shifts between favoring the right and left channels in an unpredictable manner
after just a couple of months of use , there is a great deal of static and crackling when changing the volume
sometimes rapidly turning the dial from min to max several times alleviates the problem for a few hours
this product is good if you are looking for an inexpensive , solution .
developed a short in the jack after <NUM> uses
sound was fine until then , now its a constant struggle to get the plug situated so that there is no static .
im very happy with this extention
not only does it giveme the extra length to use it for remote viewing thru my pc from bed , it is very convenient for volume i have complete privacy and control of my utube and netflix viewing late at night , i wasnt sure but it turned out to be a great buy .
it works as advertised , it is nice and small and adds a little length to your existing headphone cord
mine doesn not look exactly like the one pictured ( it is more squared off than rounded ) but no big deal , i am still pleased with it and do recommend it .
this volume control works good , no issues so far
i recommend it for anyone that owns headphones lacking volume control .
this product works fine , but when i tag it along with my jvc headphone , the combined wire length becomes unmanageable .
does what it is supposed to do
only criticism is the volume control knob is a little small .
i needed this to adjust the volume while snowboarding and wasn not able to remove my gloves while on the mountain to mess with the ipod , and this did the trick
its also good as an cord extension
no reduction in sound quality and it definitely took in some snow , but still performs just fine .
this works great
i have a mp3 player that i use when i am riding and it makes it easier to adjust the volume
fast shipping .
i have a koss headphone but leaning back in my chair was not quite long enough plus the volume control is very handy to make a quick volume control when needing to make quick volume controls as well as getting some more space
the quality is very good with the headset and volume control .
it is so convenient having a volume control for my earphones
i use this when watching my tv since there is no volume control for the earphone connection
i may order another one for use with my ipod so i won not have to dig it out of my purse to adjust the volume .
this is a great companion to my jvc noise cancelling headphones
i don not really need the extra length while traveling , but at home the added range and direct volume control is a big plus .
i used this for my father so he could control his pillow speaker control , which has no volume control
it is been working perfectly for about a year now .
i like it but it has a <NUM> foot cord
add that to the <NUM> foot cord from my headset and i am dragging around <NUM> foot of cord
i have quit using it because i catch it on so many things
i will be looking for a shorter cord for the headset
it would have been nice if the cord was removable
i don not really want to replace my headset cord and finding a shorter replacement that will fit my jvc headset is turning out to be a challenge .
my niece who lives with me loves to play video games , but we have wood floor throughout the house
this causes the noise from the video games to echo throughout the house
so i bought a rca to 3
5 mm cable and hooked up headphones not realizing that i needed something to control the volume with
this is where this koss vc20 volume control comes into play it worked wonders for my tv ( which is older and did have the rca audio out )
one thing to note is most of the modern tv do not have an rca audio out instead they have digital optical audio toslink output
this means you would have to get an adapter that takes the signal from analog to digital and back .
the volume control degraded the sound quality significantly
if you use it with a cheap earphone , it may be ok for you , definitely not enevn with koss portapro or ksc75 .
i use this with my bluetooth headphones the volume control is great which is what looking for in this product , the extra cable length is a bonus .
if you are using this for headphones , it is probably fine
i was trying to use it as a replacement volume puck for amplified speakers , and the cable is so poorly insulated that all sorts of noise comes through
the volume control is nice and it is very small .
this is yet another case of the product delivered being somewhat different than the product image , which is not agreeable in principle of making an online purchase
the product i reviews has a slightly different casing that the image and also the wording is not white but grey
my problem is that in this case i feel with this image the seller is trying to give a somewhat skewed image on the device
for one , the 3
5mm male connection ( going into your device that is producing sound ) is not a right angle connector
this can be a issue for some users since depending on their intended usage a straight connection can cause undue torquing on the 3
5mm port potentially causing damage to either the connector or the jack on the device itself
to balance this somewhat the 3
5mm cable is flexible and the jack is fairly small in comparison to some straight jacks that are larger and stick out quite far
secondly , the metal clip that is supposed to attach the device to a shirt , pocket , ect
( which is not shown in the product image ) is really cheap so does not hold fast to whatever you try to clip it on
lastly , the volume control it recessed into the chassis so it only protrudes slightly
this can be taken as a positive or a negative depending on your perspective
on the positive you will not have any issue with the volume control breaking or the volume being altered unintentionally
however because of this , altering the volume can take slightly more deliberate effort than usual
it also means that it might be uncomfortable for those of you with larger fingers
this again has to do with your preference and how you change the volume ( either with the tip of your finger close to the nail or with the flat of the tip of your finger
) overall i would have preferred the item been closer to $5 than the $10 it costs , but i was in a hurry ( which i rarely ever am when it comes to electronics )
so keep what i said in mind and look around for something that might fit you better before deciding
that is unless you were like me and just need an inline volume controller quickly and without hassle
additioni noticed this a while ago buy forgot to add it to my review , when changing the volume the sound to the headphones ( or whatever device is connected ) is changed so that the volume in one ear becomes louder than the other
it happens when the volume is only changed slightly so only another minor move is required to bring the sound back to normal but it is noticeable .
the cable is thin , but appears to be a high quality
connectors are well built
the volume control is easy to use , and will let you fine tune the volume to any lower volume .
i love having a volume switch available no matter what headphones i use
also the cord is long enough to work as an extension
i have always enjoyed koss products ; the quality of sound from their headphones just sounds better to me than most-- especially for the price .
this is more accurately called a volume limiter
it can only decrease volume and cannot increase the volume from your device
this is a very simple device that acts as a throttle on the volume provided by the output of your device
it connects to the output of your device ( an earphone jack ) and then provides a connection for earphones or speakers
once the connection is made the rheostat can reduce the volume
it does that very well and does not seem to add any static
the controller operates smoothly up and down
i use this between my laptop and an amplified set of speakers
i set my laptop to <PERCENT> output and the amplifier to <PERCENT> which turns out to be very loud with the controller in the max position
i then use the controller to reduce and increase volume without having to touch the laptop or the amplifier
when connected to my phone , i set the volume to high and reduce it as needed with the controller
it saves having to activate the screen and taking the phone in and out of my pocket
it is very handy and the extra cord length is handy for short corded earphones .
have used item very little but pleased with it
i would recommend to anyone with need of such a device .
my portable xm radio was over driving the amp in my truck no matter how i adjusted it
installed this product in line with the radio output and problem solved and for almost nothing .
this year i bought a dell vostro laptop
it turns out that many/all have a problem with the audio in that there is a buzzing sound and noise especially when using earbud headphones
someone suggested using a volume control to increase the impedence
i didn not expect it to work but it does
the koss vc20 reduced the problem to the point where it is barely perceptable
i am completely satisfied .
used for under the pillow stereo speaker
also added a small headphone amplifier between this volume control and audio source
would recommend .
please note , this will not make your music louder
it will simply control the volume - that is it
now that i have said this , let is move on
i love this little device
it works great with my samsung s3 and poweramp app
sometimes i get tired of taking my samsung in an out of my pocket just to adjust the volume - as there are some songs a bit louder than others like there are some commercials on tv that are louder than others
well , i don not have to do that any longer
i have the koss volume control clipped on the wire part of my sony headphones and i am good to go
i owned one before but i must have lost it during relocating and i was really missing it
( i will update this review if any problems arise from this device ) .
portapro headphones did not dissapoint
sound was good , and a good alternative to in ear headphones .
i bought these headphones because they collapsed into a portable state
unfortunately the bag , though of very nice material , was not at all big enough to enable me to store the phones in it
the whole experience of trying to fit the collapsed phones into the bag was quite frustrating and i am surprised that an otherwise good sounding pair as these were ( but not great ) would be matched with such an unsatisfactory bag as far as size is concerned
however , i did lol use the bag for other things and was very happy with the bag in this case
i found the sound quality not up to the past reviews which gave the portapros such a great reputation though .
well this product has absolutely exceeded my expectations in terms of the overall sound quality
. and for the price that its offered
i can recommend any one to just buy it
without thinking twice
. cons : not as comfortable as over the ear headphones
i had a koss cd player when i was little , and the bass was unmatched in a bookshelf system
it made me the envy of my friends and translated into loyalty with koss headphones
i can not say enough about these lightweight , , funky headphones
portapros have a lifetime warranty , look like something out of tron , and spoil the listener with comfort and bass reproduction
buy 'em , and find something else to worry about , in life
highly recommended .
i am on my second pair of these headphones
i am no audiophile - just a gym rat who uses them every day to drive my workouts
considering the class of headphones under $50 that i have used , for this one : the good features : great sound , light on head , excellent bang for the buck
the bad features : i carry them in my gym bag along with my other stuff
the cord gets tangled up half the time
also , after some time ( years ) the ear cushions become shredded , and must be replaced
june 22 , <NUM> update
i have purchased another pair , and i am very impressed
( new headphones needed since the previous pair would intermittently drop the signal
) the cord seems shorter , and it is thicker so it only gets a little tangled
also the ear muffins appear larger
for the price , i know of nothing that is better
a great buy .
these headphones have been the companion to my laptop since the day i bought them
they are small , light , and deliver surprisingly good sound for the size
on the negative size , the foam ear pads can fall off very easily , and have a relatively short life
the sliders that adjusts the tension in the band move to max tension at the slightest touch .
i purchased these headphones looking for a set of dollar phones
like many other reviews say , the sound quality is superb for the price range
my only complaint is the comfort
i don not wear them on a daily basis , and they are slightly difficult to get accustomed to
other than that , this is a top notch product .
good product for the cost
good sound quality , folds easily and can be used a variety of settings
nice price
there are enough reviews here to keep you busy for a few hours , so i will only mention a few points : 1 ) i had the sportapros
they sound great , too ( same drivers ) , but the portapros are really worth the extra $13 or so bucks you will spend on them
the pps are much more robust , and look better imho
just spend the extra cash , you won not be disappointed
2 ) no questions asked lifetime warranty
3 ) they sound fantastic for most of us average joe is who love music , and tend to boost bass and treble on eqs
they are worth every penny !
i was little skeptical about buying this one
portapros are produced all the way since the 80s and have a flimsy look
my doubts continued as i was unpacking my portapros
could this little , flimsy , plastic set of headphones be that good ? all of my doubts have evaporated once i have tried using them
these headphones have two big pros : 1
sound quality : one thing you should be aware of is that these headphones are _loud_
i have compared them to my sennheiser hd201 and sony
there is no comparison
portapro is much louder
of course , if you don not like it , you can turn down the volume
however , despite the loudness , the sound is excellent
i can pick a lot of details in my music cds that were nearly undetected with the and barely audible with the hd201
when i play first person shooter games , i am getting excellent directional sound
comfort : the comfort is excellent
the headphones sit very tightly on my head and yet they don not apply much pressure to my ears
i can wear my portapros for hours without feeling any discomfort
the reason for this , is that these headphones come with extra cushions the sit above your ears and shift some pressure to your head leaving very little pressure on ears
you can also choose how much pressure you want to have applied to your ears
if the default is too much , you can shift some of that pressure to the auxiliary cushions by changing the "comfort zone" settings ( the blue buttons above the driver , it is best to start playing with them once you already wear the headphones )
since the headphones sit tight on your head , they are suitable for outdoor or gym use
the cable length is just right to reach your pc speaker or mp3 player ( about <NUM> feet ) , but i suppose that some people will find it too short
finally , the set folds easily and fits into a small leather bag provided for portability
and , have i mentioned lifetime warranty ? if they ever break , just send them to koss with a $6 check
they will fix or replace them for you
overall i am very satisfied and would recommend these headphones to anyone who needs cheap , reliable headphones with good sound quality for either indoor or outdoor use .
you can not beat the sound quality for this price
it is good for every type of music
clean high and solid low
if you listen mainly to hip hop where booming bass is important , you might want to check out other makes
i listen to all types of music , so this is a good headset for this purpose
it does look a little dorky , but sound quality is more important to me than looks
the headband does pinch your hair occasionally , if you are not careful adjusting it
mine did not come with a case
it came with a soft pouch instead , so not a whole lot of protection there for traveling purposes
even in the folding position , it is not easy to get it in the pouch
the sound does leak ( enough to bother my wife as she is lying next to me in bed )
the ear foams feel a little weak and may wear out quickly after frequent use
don not know if you can buy the foam separately
i gave it <NUM> stars mainly for sound quality and price ( $30-$40 )
i have had mine for about 2
5 years now and they still sound just as good as the various $100 plus headsets i recently listened to at the local best buy store .
many of my friends look at these headphones and wonder why i make such a big deal about them
they are not the most beautiful headphones to look at
but do they kick xxx when it comes to sound there are not another pair it this price range that even comes close .
i have a pair of sennheiser px <NUM> headphones which i bought a couple years ago use for listening to music , videos etc on my pc or sansa
however they were never really very suitable for jogging or biking in ( not a tight enough fit and will come loose during excessive movement )
the bud type earphones just don not cut it for me - uncomfortable and sound quality just crappy
i wonder why most other people are happy to wear bud type phones ? maybe my ears are deformed
anyways , i googled the web and found several good review is of these koss phones for running
i bought a pair a couple of months ago and i must say that it is one of the best buys i have ever made
the sound quality of the koss portapro is excellent and slightly better than my sennheiser px 100 is
they fit very snugly and feel very light when running and that plus the excellent sound quality make them a great buy
one feels very happy when you have paid a small amount of money for great quality and great sound
now when i am sitting at my pc and need phones for listening it becomes a bit more of a toss up
the koss sound quality is great and with a snug fit
the sennheiser px <NUM> although not quite as good sound quality have a very light feel to them
for walking , running and general moving around - these koss phones are the way to go
may <NUM> update : these guys are holding up well despite some pretty rugged treatment - highly recommended
i bought a pair of these while i was in new york - i bought them from one of the big camera/gear brokers there and paid about $35 for them
i bought them because my iems are too dangerous to wear on city streets and my akg k271s are too big to wear out
so , these seemed like a happy medium
they are very durable , they have excellent bass for something this size , and they have a cool retro look
with the lifetime guarantee i am comforted in the idea of getting them replaced if i should accidentally break them
so far so good though , 6+ months later .
i have been using this headphone for a few months
for the build - it looked filmsy , but even i haven not been using it very carefully , it is still working well , no parts broken
for the sound quality , the bass is very good , is good
i hope the high range could be a bit clearer
meanwhile , i found that this headphone is quite musical , no harsh high range , and enjoyable to listen to , especially for piano music , easy listening , and jazz music
still the high range could be a bit improved ; but , at this price range , it is very okay .
great audio with the headphones , nothing else needs to be said about that
but now that that is said , these headphones can be uncomfortable on larger melons
i find myself pulling them off and switching to my over the ear koss headphones because they don not feel like they are crushing my skull
also , the cord is by far the worst part about his set
the cable itself is a little too short for my tastes , about <NUM> feet
this means i feel tethered to my laptop often
but more importantly is the quality of the cord
the cord itself feels like a wire stuck in a narrow sheet of plastic
the reason that is important is because the wire holds its shape any time its folded or bent
this means that the pretty cool looking pair of headphones now have a cord is sometimes so bent out of shape that it rides up in my face .
i usually use ear buds , or speakers , but i thought i would try these
the bass and the sound response in general are quite good
they are seemingly flimsy , or should i say , light weight , but i have been pretty hard on them and they are still in one piece
i would recommend them over similarly priced ear buds , so long as the style appeals to you .
i have been using these headphones since 1996
i have owned many pairs but koss has a no questions return policy , one time even sending me a new pair because i inquired about replacement ear pads
the sound that these cans put out are second to none
i flirted with grado is and other expensive headphones but always run back to these
the look is very 80 is retro because they are unchanged ( by popular demand ) since their introduction and they bring warm deep sound to anything you plug them into
ear buds are for idiots
step up to a pair of these babies and you will be stoked at the sound they put out .
i bought a pair of these
over <NUM> years ago ! they still work , and more important , sound fantastic ! i have replaced the ear pads due to age , but that is it
what stands out about these today , just as it did back in the early 1980s is the true high fidelity sound quality - including true extended bass
from low bass through the highest treble , these are well balanced and natural sounding
more money will buy a headphone that excels in one area , but to truly outperform these overall is getting up there
to add more transparency to the musical reproduction is going to just plain cost you - and they will be a larger set
in closing , i misplaced my pair ( since found ) and spent $50 on a pair of well respected affordable akgs
these sound better
highly recommended !
these are one of the best headphones that can be bought for the money ! pros- great sound , i listen to rock and pop mp3 music mainly , and that sounds great ! all friends who are accustomed to junk earphones that come with the ipods are just amazed when they listen through this ! - comfort ! you just don not feel them on your head after some time
- lifetime warranty ! i bought them at amazon in 2004
was having some troubles with one earpiece not working properly , and all the foams were gone
i got them repaired absolutely free ( just paying the shipping costs ) , and that too in india ! they are like new now
- price ! bought them for $35 at amazon
- portability is decent
they fold and don not take much space
cons- sound leaks
i use them at office , and cubicle mates sometimes tell me to lower the volume- looks , as others have said , they definitely look awkward
overall , unless you want earbuds/noise cancelling phones/audiophile quality , you cannot go wrong with these .
i have been using these headphones for over a year now and they are simply excellent
i know some have an issue with the style , but all i really care about is the sound quality
it is terrific .
these headphones are really great , unfortunately mine broke early on
the return policy calls for you to ship the items back to koss + $9
00 shipping and handling
i stood up and literally tore the cables out
in my own defense , they are not secured in tightly
i still give the headphones four stars because i believe they are stylish and the sound is really great
they really fit a comfortable niche for those that do not want ; and , they have a really strong ability to throw sounds and convince you that you have more than two sound channels .
stop looking and just get these
they don not feel as comfortable as some other headphones , but they sound great ! i love the retro look too .
i liked these headphones , pretty much what i paid for
the metal band on the top grabs hair sometimes if you adjust it on your head
so just don not do that and you will be good
good sound , fairly comfortable
essentially just what i wanted .
they are collapsible , comfortable , they have great sound quality ( good bass ) , and they come with a lifetime warranty
how can you not buy these ?
 comment , june 11 , 2007i ended up sending one of the broken headsets back to koss , along with a $6 check
turns out , these have a lifetime guarantee , and for $6 , they will repair or replace them for you
i got the new pair in rapid order-- total was about <NUM> days
caution--if you send these in for repair , do not include the pouch ; they returned only the headphones , without the pouch
anyway , it was really nice having the new headphones
but , this morning , i picked them up to put into the little carry pouch i use for my nano and headphones , and found that the left earpiece was dangling again , broken at the swivel point
i really like the comfort of these headphones and the fact that i don not have to crank up the volume to hear
but , i am now actively looking for a replacement to use , as these are obviously too frail for the constant folding and unfolding they get for my commutes to and from work
sorry to have to do this , but i would change my <NUM> stars down to <NUM> ( but amazon is not letting that happen )
if you will not be stuffing these in a storage pouch but will be simply laying them on a desk or table , then these are great
if you plan to fold and open a lot , i now suggest you look for something more durable
sorry , koss ! ------------origianal review jan 6 , 2007 : quality good enough to make me get a 3rd pairi have gone through 1
5 pairs of these things , now ( my current pair is nearly ready for replacement )
the first pair finally broke apart while folded in the soft bag that comes with it ( i had had those about <NUM> or <NUM> years ) -- i took them out and the left earpiece had broken at the plastic attach point and was left hanging
my second pair is now only 2
5 years old ( purchased april 2004 ) , and the wire at the plug end is getting iffy
if the wire moves , sometimes the phones go into single ear mode , so i guess one of the wires inside the very thin cable is breaking at the joint
this plug has a right angle into the player , and it is right at the cord end of the right angle piece where the wire is weakening
i am going to try taping it here to keep it from moving , and see if that solves the problem temporarily
i do side by side test with this headphone and others used by other individuals
i ask them to put the volume where it won not blow out my eardrums , then i listen using their phones and settings
i then plug in my portapros , and listen
so far , i have not found anyone is setup to beat the quality and clairty and volume delivered by these phones
usually , i have to turn the player down when i plug in my phones because they pick up so much more than others
if you are prepared to buy a new pair of these every <NUM> years or so , then these are definitely a good deal
i just wish koss would send a hard case for storage since i do believe that the soft case does not protect them enough when they are stowed
koss could also thicken the cable a little bit to make it more durable , or do a gradual thickening as the cable nears the plug
when i get a new pair , i will tape that end of the cable to try to postpone this problem -- less than <NUM> years is too soon for this to happen
becasue of these two design flaws , i rate these a <NUM> intead of the <NUM> that the quality of sound delivers
i listen to jazz , smooth jazz , pop , rock , and audiobooks primarily
happy listening !
i bought the sennheiser px200 and returned them since they hurt my head ( 7 3/4 hat size )
these headphones sound better , ( better range and low end ) , fit better , and cover more of my ears
solid value .
most anywhere on the web you can find these for between $30 to $40 bucks and they are well worth it
i tend to be a bit of an audio snob but i am using these on a cell phone and occasionally an ipod
so i understand those aren not going to be able to push a lot of power in order to get a full range
even with that being the case i was pleasently surprised with the efficiency of these
you don not have to turn them up very loud to get a full sound
bass is very strong , it can be a little too strong at times depending on your musical taste
i listen to a wide range , from classical , to and for things like jazz and classical i find that these struggle a little because the sound separation is okay , the highs are a little on the flat side and the bass can be a little imbalanced
this isn not to say they sound bad but for music demands with a high range then these aren not going to do as good as they would for something like for whom these are exceptional
the construction is pretty good though the design is very dated but i can live with that because i am concerned about the sound it produces not how cute they are
if good sound is what your looking for at a great price just listen one time and you will understand why they are considered classics
for a $30 price you can get $100 sound .
amazon just reminded me that i purchased these from amazon in 2000
these portapro is used to be the standard as the most comfortable and best sounding headphones for portable , pc and casual listening
you can not go wrong at the price point
on my cowon iaudio u3 player ( much better audio , watts , than any crapple ipus ) , where one can really hear the quality of audio
it has several audio formats that include the superior open source formats like the losless flac and the best lossy format , ogg
i listen to different types of music , classical , classic rock , blues , progressive , audio documentaries , audio books
i am one that really loves to listen to music that is distortion free as possible
i love clear , clean sounds that are natural where you can really pick out all instruments , little nuances in harmonies
where quietness , silence in a song , will be totally quiet
i have that as good as the portapro is are , they give more of a distorted sound , especially with distortion at bass
i say this in compariason to sennheiser headphones and what i see as the best of breed , the sennheiser px100s
someone called them "livier" than the px100s , where i totally understand what they are referring too
the "livier" part is why i gave them to me son
that is distortion , especially at bass
i don not like distortion or over amplification that creates distortion
but if one prefers that heavier , distorted bass sound , which many do , these are the ones
they are sooo comfortable , but then again so are the px100s
i for one , couldn not care less what others think if they look cool , ugly , whatever
what is essential is the comfort and audio quality
if someone is really bothered because they are not in a style that is not currently marketed , then i feel the issue is withe the individual , not the headphones
they really are great and i see at 29
99 , a great buy
if you want , you can pay of $100 , and get some heavily marketed headphones that are more stylist , but will be a more more uncomfortable and probably not sound as good as the portapros or the px100s
i also will tell you that i cannot stand the headphones that are made to drown out sound
for one , the headphones that do allow air sound better
the headphones that totally cut out air and environmental sounds , literally give me a headache
i too want to know if someone is trying to get my attention or if their is some kind of loud noise that i should be aware of
jonas for me , i have my portapro is to my son several years ago
i love a listen to music that gives me the most distortionless
the koss looks delicate , but its folding design belies a hardiness that competitors should try to emulate
all headphones require a "" period before they sound their best , and that is certainly true of the koss
after , they show themselves to be equal to their reputation
retailing between $30 and $40 or so , they offer good fidelity at low to medium volume , but grate a bit when pushed too hard
the works nicely with a variety of musical styles , pop and rock to jazz , but occasionally has trouble with the distortion levels of punk ; this may not be a problem with most listeners
while the sound is clear and offers fine fidelity , songs often lack "color" -- a common complaint with less expensive headphones
yet , compared to its competition , the offers a much cleaner sound ; no irritating bass thump on these phones
these are the ipod phones of choice .
i have had my portapros for several years now , and they have served me very , very well
pros : - best sound i have heard in a small portable headphone
( my grado sound better , but there is no way you'd walk down the street in 'em ) - fold reasonably well into a clump- durable as heck ( other than the replaceable foam earpiece covers )
i use the heck out of these , and they take it in stride
cons : - look pretty
- foam earpiece covers need replacing every <NUM> or so uses - cheap and from koss , takes a minute to do .
after doing a bit of research this headphone was recommended as the best portable headphone in the price range , which i mostly agree with
the good : -great sound quality
bass booms and highs sound clear
-much more comfortable than buds ( this may be more of a personal choice )
-stylish but not too garish
the bad : -my hair gets caught in the adjustable band sometimes
-feels little bit loose on my head , even when it is secure
also , this is more of a peeve , but the included "carrying case" is really just terrible
it is very hard to fit the headphones in there , even when they are folded as small as they can possibly be
you can tell koss really cheaped out on the material for the bag , it is just too small .
i have owned these for <NUM> years and still like them
they are a good compromise between tiny portable earphones and home headphones
they sound good and are apparently durable , as i have been using the same pair for all these years
my only reservation is that the foam earpads tend to get damaged when you toss them in a bag with other items , so use the case
i don not remember if mine came with one
also , consider buying the replacement earpads
i have worn a couple pair out and damaged a couple pair
it is possible that those earphones have caught up in sound quality , so consider those
i am not in a hurry to replace my porta pros , though .
that is about it , really honest headphones , cheap and the sound is quite balanced
headband pressure adjustable ( firm / light )
i find the firm a bit too tight but it is a good setting when being active
totally recommend .
the first thing that needs to be said about these headphones is that they are really ugly
there can be no denying it
the weird earpieces with the bar atop is just ugly , ugly , ugly
that said , these are easily the most comfortable portables i have worn , a situation largely a product of the very features that make the set ugly
additionally , the sound is good
i don not feel the sound is as orgasmically supreme as other reviewers suggest , but the sound is very good
if you listen to a lot of jazz or classical , some senns might serve you better
if you listen to more rock and hip hop , you will be pleased with the portapros , if only for the comfort , which is truly exceptional
i use them with my ipod , and am well pleased .
these are simply the best headphones that you can purchase for an under $100 price tag , and they are under 50$ ! very full , clear , sound with an amazing amount of bass
the styling isn not the greatest in my opinion , but the amazing sound quality more than makes up for it .
despite looking like they are straight out of 1993 , these headphones sound like 2014
amazing sound quality that matches my studio headphones , with a durable '' construction
base is solid , highs are not peaky or harsh on the ears , and the mids are smooth and warm sounding
very comfortable on the ears
my original pair stopped working , and i sent them to koss and for $10 i had a brand new pair sent to me within <NUM> weeks ! only complaint is that the way the metal band is designed with two pieces it can pinch your neck hair when sitting around your neck instead of on your head
minor complaint but it hurts !
pro' sound durablecon' me explain a little about the cons , very ugly headphones provided with some temple dampening system that does absolutely nothing
the metal band comes in a very unnatural round bend that make the temple pads barely touch my cranium so they leave me wondering who is oblong head might this design fit perfectly ? i have been pondering bending the metal to fit me more properly but i really don not like the idea
the headphones metal bands will pull your hairs and also note if you like loud bass you might want to look elsewhere
there might be a better headset for your portable music needs but i have yet to find something above the sound quality of my porta pros
there are great phones for sure
i have a collection of over ear , on ear , and phones and developed some critical listening ability and in my experience the koss sound good
i am not going to discuss all the genres for the sake of time , but they did sound good for classical and rock and edm
the retrodesign is fine , but the mechanics of leaves me wary
it does catch my hair on a consistent basis , and despite the pressure settings over the ear , they somehow cause discomfort within an hour
i am thinking that a relatively small percentage of people would share that experience
i do like the folding mechanism and the life time warranty ! nice
yes , people say you get a lot for the money , but unless these are your only phones , i'd likely be reaching out for my 'other' phones .
i have been wearing these daily for about <NUM> months now , and am extraordinarily pleased with them for the price
yes , there is a caveat- i paid $40 for these , and for *that price* they have fit and/or surpassed all of my expectations
i believe these can compete with any headphones in the &lt ; $100 range
i do have two complaints , though
audio : 4/5
bass is powerful , highs are clear , mids are crisp enough
perhaps a little too well blended for rock ( not much emphasis on treble ) , but fantastic for acoustic/instrumental pieces and hip hop
i dock <NUM> star because of the utter lack of sound isolation
having pads with no noise cancellation tech really means no noise cancelling ( duh )
this is fine , but it also unavoidably detracts from sound quality when there is any noise around you
the pads also bleed sound easily- i had to be mindful even playing at half volume in public
aesthetic : 5/5
as authentically retro as you can get , since they are literally from the 80 is
build quality : 5/5
simplicity makes for durability in this case
-1 for hurting your ears after a couple hours of wear
fortunately , you can adjust the pads so they angle away from your ears , shifting the pressure up to the side of your head
the springy metal band will allow these to fit any head size
+1 for the <NUM> degree input jack
straight jacks get bent out of shape too easily ; this design won not suffer the fate of many a pair of ipod earbuds
for the price , there is no superior
that much i will assert strongly
if you want audiophile headphones and have over <NUM> to spend , or want noise cancellation ( take the metro to school/work ? you won not want to use these
) then i advise looking elsewhere
if you are on a budget and want simple quality without the bells and whistles , these are perfectly suited for you and you will enjoy uncompromising sound quality .
had these in college in the early 2000s and now again a decade later
kind of a cult following of audiophiles , fashion lovers , and retro freaks back then and now
great punch and bass for a small and simple headphone
very good price from amazon for $30ish vs
msrp $50 or even higher for limited edition colors or cable volume control
great alternative to ear buds or full cans , somewhat portable because they can fold up but they are a little flimsy so i would not recommend packing them tightly or under heavy weight in luggage
obviously not closed so neighbors will hear your music at louder volumes
however this isn not a problem in louder public venues like the bus , subway , airport , train stn , etc .
i have tried a lot of portable cans - everything ranging from cheap gumdrops , all different beats up to bose noise cancelling ) - i always end up coming back to the koss porta pro
its can fold up into a small package like a mini transformer , its comfortable ( i never got hair stuck - unlike my akgs ) and the sound is amazing
bass is strong , the mids are pretty good
its very good for current day music
it is very energy efficient - can set your iphone at halfway and still get good sound
i wouldn not recommend it if your musical set is acoustics or other lighter genre however still much better than say stock buds .
bought these for christmas , they don not fit to head very well and tend to snap off if bumped
these are very light weight
they are still working though .
work well and easy to use
the cord is to short , but the sound , build quality , and weight are are outstanding
these headphones excel in these most important areas
i will constantly pick them over a more expensive heavy set .
it works ,
the sound really come out from the phones
just not as good sounds as i thought , or maybe i just played crappy music with lousy mp3 quality , downloaded from unreliable source
i confused
but the good thing is , i can bring it to airplane and don not have to use that even crappier headphones from airlines ! yeay ! it is not as pretty as it look from the picture though , i think that beats by dr
dre look more sturdier than this .
over the years , i have not had the best luck with portable earphones
tired of the awful sound of default earbuds , i have experimented with shure , bose , sennheiser , klipsch , andjvcbrands , ranging in price from $25 to $100 , but have never really been satisfied with sound signatures that were either too , too muddy , or cramped soundstage
eventually , i got tired with the uncomfortable and often dirty world of earbuds and decided to go back into the world of portable phones
reading at about thekoss ksc75 portable stereophone headphones , i ordered them from amazon
while no match for a900x headphonesat home , i was impressed with the richness and spaciousness of the ksc75s , but it wasn not long before i found the clips uncomfortable for my ears , so after a couple of months i went ahead and ordered the ksc75 is big brother , the portapros
i couldn not be happier with my decision
the sound signature is very similar to the ksc75s , but there is a touch more bass and depth
it is not a flat , analytical sound , not too muddy but very fun and warm -- perfect for portable listening around the office
they are open phones , so you will be able to hear your surroundings and anyone nearby will be able to hear what you are listening to at high volumes , so bear that in mind
build quality is fair , about what you'd expect for the price range , but the portapros are very light on my head
considering that their sound is superior to a couple pairs of $100 earbuds i have used , i will take the trade in isolation for comfort and sound quality
i am also a fan of the 1980s styling
they are not perfect
in addition to the openness and build quality , the headband occasionally pulls out a hair or two , but it doesn not happen often enough to be burdensome
while the portapros fold down to a surprisingly compact ball , getting them into the included travel pouch can be a tight fit
overall , the negatives are greatly outweighed by the positives
if you are in the market for a portable set of headphones , the koss portapros are highly recommended .
the portapro has apparently been around since 1985
that in itself should tell you something about this product
i recently bought a notebook computer for around $500
it has a 750gb hard drive
back in <NUM> i bought my first notebook
it had 6gb and cost $1 , 100
in electronic product terms these should have been retired decades ago
there are good reasons they haven not been though
the longevity of the portapro speaks volume about this product
i am fortunate enough to have a soul by ludacris sb300
it is a $300 headphone
i like it a lot
it produces an excellent all around balanced sound that brings out vocals and all instruments
the portapro does the same
the portapro actually sound better
the sound is breathtaking in its accuracy and clarity
they even leak less sound , are lighter , and require no batteries
the portapro bring an unbelievably accurate , , rich , detailed , and lush sound for the price
you are getting the music , all of the music , the way the artists wanted it to be heard
it isn not often a product can cost <NUM> to <NUM> times less than other good products but the portapro does
you can get new headphones and a new ipod or other mp3 player and spend less than other headphones and still have the better set of headphones
and they are very comfortable and light
the headphones themselves are well padded as is the adjustment bar above
and the adjustment bar works
i have it set in the middle of the comfort zone and get just the right amount of snugness
you also get virtually zero sound leakage
it makes the portapro the perfect work headphones : fantastic sound , virtually no sound leakage , comfortable enough to wear all day , very light , foldable and storable
the only nitpicking i can do is that the headband is not padded and they look maybe a little goofy
but the `goofy' gives you that nice comfort zone
all in all a quite extraordinary product
if amazon had a product hall of fame where items made it for a combination of performance and value , the portapro would be in it for sure
a great gift for yourself or a friend or family member
lastly before i bought these i did some research and they do have a lifetime guarantee
you can send them in and the shipping back costs a total of $6 from what people related on the internet
you can spend many times more for these and not get any added performance
thank you koss .
i have occasionally read reviews about these over the years
but i irrationally felt from their appearance that they probably weren not as good as so many people said they were
but indeed they are
as everyone discovers , the experience of comfort and sound clarity in these matters can be extremely personal
on the basis of sheer discomfort alone , i have greatly disliked every one of all the types of headphones i have ever tried- until now
and anything is much worse
so i have simply been looking for something/anything with decent sound quality that didn not cause my ears to burn and my entire head to ache after <NUM> minutes
now the long frustrating quest merely to find wearable headphones is over at last
what a relief !
these headphones are simply the best headsets ever made
clear highs , deep lows
i have been using them for years and occasionally need to replace them
$50 at almost any store that sells them , i found them on amazon for $35
i have tried many other brands over the years and many price ranges , including the noise canceling bose ones ( they hurt my ears
) nothing comes close
my son destroyed the pair i bought here a few years ago so he is not touching these : - )
i bought these because they looked kooky
they sound good and they are foldable but they are not as comfy as i imagined
they hurt after an hour or so .
i bought these babies at a fye when i was just shopping around
i have read that they have amazing sound and you can not find a better sound for the money
man were the reviewers right ! the is amazing , with great highs and bass
the bass is delivered so well , i can not find words other than impressive and intense , especially for the size of these headphones
i must say , they get better sound than headphones that range up to $120 and even more easily
i listen to a lot of 60 is to 80 is rock and all types of heavy metal and the sound is delivered powerfully
a 3d type of sound
also try the koss is for an even better performance
pro is1 ) price is unbeatable2 ) great balance of high is , mid is and low is3 ) ground breaking bass4 ) great ( separation of instruments ) 5 ) a 3d sound6 ) cool 80 is design7 ) sound doesn not need to be amplified ( it shouldn not be either ) con is1 ) gets slightly uncomfortable to wear after a while ( 1 hour or so ) 2 ) seems flimsy at times3 ) although it seems to be made of good material , the case/bag that comes with headphones is too small and a pain to get headphones in and out of .
these koss portapro headphones work great ! normally the only thing i care about with headphones is how durable they are , though ever since i became an adult , and my head got bigger , i suppose the size and comfort is another thing that needs to be taken into consideration ! i used to have really horrible luck with headphones back in the 90 is
the headphones would always lose the volume in one side of the speaker so i'd have to constantly keep readjusting them and twisting the end piece attached to the stereo equipment to get the volume back
it was annoying
this problem still exists from time to time , but these particular type of koss headphones haven not been giving me this particular problem and i am very happy about that
nothing worse than when your favorite moment of a song comes on , and bam- the volume drops out from one side
i highly recommend everyone purchase a pair of these headphones .
for what these cost they do what they do well
they are very comfortable and conform to my head with the medium setting on the adjustment
as far as sound goes , i haven not had any complaints
they sound much better than similarly priced headphones that i have owned , and these will be my permanent headphones for being out and about
sound leaks of course , but you could tell that from the image
overall i think these are the best headphone for the price range at the time of this review
they have also been surprisingly durable .
so headphones break on me all the time
i go through at least a pair every year
i guess i don not treat them amazingly and i like having music on me at all times so they get worn out fast
i realized awhile back i can go two ways on my next pair : cheap and easily replaceable or expensive and higher quality ( hopefully lasting longer )
i tried the latter a couple times since i am a bit of an audiophile but this time i was sick of the joint at the jack breaking which is how pretty much every pair i have ever owned has broken ( can not wait for the day of cheap , good sound quality wireless ! )
then on cnet i saw the koss portapro listed as the best bargain headphones and i thought hell why not , my last pair were $10 and they only lasted six months
got these and i'd say its probably the best dollar to quality value money can buy
the sound is rich and full , especially in the base department
when i first started using them , the treble sounded a little muffled but after a break in period i stopped noticing
i listen to a lot of bass heavy electronic music as well as alternative/indie rock and these cans are perfect for it
because they are over here , you are not going to get great isolation but its good enough
loud traffic might leak in a bit ( and a good bit of sound leaks out ) but its just enough to be aware of your surroundings while enjoying your music
i leave the fit on tight to get the best isolation though you can conveniently loosen things up if you want
they feel very nice on my big head either way with the temple pads
the retro stylings are pretty cool and they are definitely unique in their design
some problems : i like the portable collapse mode but the included case ( which is actually a very nice little pleather bag ) is too tight a fit
every time i squeeze the cans in there i am afraid i am going to break them or that i am wearing the wire connections unnecessarily
i will probably end up using the pouch for some other purpose though since it is quite nice
along similar lines , it seems like they cut the cost so low by chucking out a lot of the casing and other "useless" plastics on the headset but that makes them feel overly fragile
so far they are holding up fine but they definitely feel a bit light
likewise the plug is a bit small and looks like a definite achilles heel
lastly the cord is only 4' so if your audio source isn not in your pocket or nearby , you may run into trouble sans extension
summary : great deal for the money so why not ? also , packaging says koss covers them for life though we will cross that bridge when we come to it .
original review : i am getting ready for a three week trip with a lot of flying to south america , so i thought i'd read the reviews for all the noise cancelling headphones out there and ended up buying the sennheiser pxc250s
they sound decent , but compared to my cheapo koss portapros , they suck
the koss portapro is simply the best lightweight travel headphone i have ever owned
i am not sure why they are so retro looking , but they are really comfortable and sound like high end headphones without being giant monsters
the sound quality and the bass and volume levels are amazing
don not question yourself
buy these and try them out and you will be extremely happy that you did ! updated : 2011
wow , i can not believe i bought these in 2003 ! the earpads , after almost <NUM> years , need replacement
that is it
they still sound amazing when i put them on and they make music oh so enjoyable compared to earbuds
not even $500 earbuds sound as good as these little $30ish 1970s looking headphones
and they are now actually just retro enough looking and to me say "hey , those must sound awesome because they are sorta ugly" so i wear them proudly
don not hesitate
plus you have <NUM> days to try them out , that is why amazon is so awesome .
these headphones are ok , but they look cheap , since they are , and i didn not notice much difference in the sound quality from my sparkplug is to these
i couldnt wear these for more than an hour without them hurting my ears , but for the price you could certainly do worse
honestly though , if your willing to go to in ear headphones , go with the spark plugs , the are better at noise isolating , fit better in your ears , and i really cant notice a diffrence in sound quality + they are like half the price .
i have had these for a while , haven not used them much and then have begun to do so with library books on cd
okay to good sound , but the durability isn not great --- one of the ear pieces constantly comes off
it can be , but it is a nuisance .
it was my first plunge into the mp3 world and i felt that the key would be choosing the right headphones
following a good deal of research i believe i made the right choice
these koss portapro is are lightweight with an excellent sound , and the unique design makes them very comfortable
i have tried the bose $220 headsets - and if you fly alot they are probably worth it for the sound dampening effect - but if someone makes a better sounding set for less than twice as much - buy it
for $35 these are well worth the money
u p d a t e : purchased in january 2008 , i have been using these for <NUM> years now and have been through <NUM> or <NUM> sets of earpiece covers
they still sound great ! [one time i thought the bass had gone out on one side as it had an awful rattle , but i cleaned it out - it was a hair against a speaker - and it sounded fine again
so check for debris before you toss yours out
one of the best truly portable headphones you can get
perfect for portable devices if you don not mind looking a little geeky with it is 80 is styling
the next step up would be grado sr60 or sony ( which i own ) but those are a lot bulkier and more expensive
it has very strong bass for its size
the only thing i would change is a better quality wire that lasts longer
on the plus side , it does have the koss lifetime warranty ( just pay the shipping ) .
these koss headphones have an excellent dynamic range and will support full , rich sound in spite of their light weight
its easy to forget that you are wearing these because they are comfortable and adjust well
they don not squeeze on the ears and head like a lot of headphones do but they stay put comfortably
i also like the way the headphones fold into such a small size , they fit in a coat pocket or computer case pocket
while they look like they might be a little frail , they seem to be pretty rugged
i have a few different sets of headphones and these became my instant favorite .
but great headphones , period , for any application
these are my favorite headphones - that is not to say they are the most detailed , accurate , or will fool you into thinking they are a set of stax or anything ( they are , of course , astonishingly accurate and detailed )
no other headphones combine this level of comfort , soundstage , openness , and plain excitement into such a compact , durable , and cheap package
these are tiny tiny tiny , but rock out with authority
there is been a lot of jibber jabber on these fair internets about the newest contender for the portable headphone crown - the sennheiser px100
i bought a pair of those senns and lived with them for a couple of months - they are acceptable for a set of portable cans , i guess , but tend to get very congested and cluttered in the midrange
they are also bland and cold
beyond sound , they are not even as comfortable as the portapros , as they require constant adjustment to stay on top of your head while you are walking around
finally , the senns are not only less durable than the portapros , but the warranty is only two years vs
koss is incredible no questions asked lifetime warranty
that is right , you never have to buy a set of headphones again , until you die
just incredible
if you want to demo this sound t a lower price , try out the koss ksc <NUM> ear clip model , but be warned they are nowhere near as comfortable
buy with confidence .
these are by far the best sounding portable headphone i have ever heard
they are very efficient and play louder than most small headphones of this type
the sound on the low end defies their small size and they have plenty of great sound at the top too
as far as style goes i have heard a lot of people complain that they are out of date looking
i am not quite sure what the problem is
just about any headphones of this type are going to be a band with two round speakers , not much you can do in the way of "style"
if you would prefer the band to go behind your head you can try the sportapro
for the money these are hard to beat
the sound is so good they make a good choice for everyday listening as well as activities where portability is needed .
seriously , are these airplane headphones ? that is how poor i found the sound quality in these
i was shocked after seeing all the great reviews for these and then after finally checking them out for myself , wow , what a let down
they do look cool but even the $5 skullcandy earbuds with poor sound quality sounds better than these
i cannot believe this is koss , i have owned numerous headphones by them but this is just sad .
the earphones are fine , but they create too much pressure physically on the skull ( ears )
they don not just sit , they squeeze onto your ears
definitely a minus for me
maybe i will get used to them , but so far i feel it was a bad call .
i bought these after shure jacked up the price of their mini headphone from $30 to $90 ( huh ? )
anyway , these sound just fine and are comfortable
my only complaint is how each side of the head band is connected together , that if i adjust it while on my head , my hair can get caught under the band
yoowwwzaaaa ! i don not have long hair , so i would imagine it would be even worse for those people .
i didn not care much for these the first time i heard them , tried them again and liked them very much , but later just seemed flat and not much life in there
at first a wrote a positive review , but the more i listen the less i like
great sound , time proven stats and abilities
check out reviews elsewhere , i did , these are the best quality for the price .
i have heard nothing but good things about these and i finally decided to try them
the verdict ? not bad at all ( for the price ) but i am not sure they deserve such high praise
obviously , they are very affordable and they sound pretty good2
compact and very portablecons
sound can be a bit muffled at times
sometimes there is a bit too much bass
this is not terribly distracting once you get used to it but it is noticeable if you are listening for it at all
the touted feature that is supposed to make them more comfortable doesn not seem to do much at all for me
the cushions are fairly comfortable for what they are but they are a tad small on my ears and this becomes a bit scratchy and uncomfortable after a couple of hours
i'd buy them again if i had a tight budget and needed a set of compact , portable headphones
but i'd think about stepping up to something a bit better sounding if i could spend more .
not sure if anyone else experienced this but mine had some wierd rattle on the left ear that went away if i hit it hard enough or let it play for a few seconds
if i let it "cool down" the issue would come back
not sure what it was but had that not been a problem i might have kept them
the sound was average and i do not understand why people say it had ridiculous bass , i don not think it did
this is an average sounding headphone by comparison
nothing to write home about
i got the sony v6 and those are very good , glad i got those , would like to try the audio technica m50 one day
i also got those really popular panasonic earbuds here for like $5
87 , those also suck , the jvc gumy earbuds sound way better
i think those earbuds represent a good value like the pinnacle pn8+
i know that is not an earphone but the gumys really are that good of a value at <NUM> bucks
anyways i might give these portapro another chance
probably not though .
i listen to rock ( stones , bruce , led zep , doobies , kate bush , eurythmics , etc
) and tons of classical -- lots of beethoven , but also choral ( rutter and p&auml ; rt ) and baroque ( handel and bach ) and especially piano concertos
i discovered jazz about two years ago and listen to much bill evans and miles and tord gustavsen
i own grado <NUM> headphones , nad cd player , and a nice music setup with paradigm speakers
what is my favorite listening experience ? my iphone with these koss ! on my second pair now and always keep a spare pair in the study in case i ever lose these
bass is fantastic and mids perfect
i would boost the treble a bit to match the purity of my grados , but nothing can touch the experience of these koss 'phones
greatest experience for rock music
i am loving them more every day
not just great portable headphones -- they are amazing headphones , period
buy now .
this morning they sold for $38
72 or something like that
then they jumped the price to only a <PERCENT> discount
now , it is a <PERCENT> discount
this is a bad business practice and amazon is doing this more and more
it lessens the ability to purchase a product
i was ready to doit , but not when they suddenly jumped the price
i like the phones but not price jumps when i show interest in something .
these sound amazing , hands down the best under fifty you can buy
not as stylish as some or even as durable but with a lifetime warrenty you can not go wrong
best sounding open ear headphones i have ever heard
i have used them almost every day for a long time
bass is very powerful for something that doesn not enclose the ear
sound is very clear and they can also handle a lot of power
as others have said , the headband can rip out a few hairs occasionally , but that is the only complaint i have .
these are great headphones for the money
i wish the cord was a little longer as i use them at my desk
the sound is far better than i have found with others in this price range , so it is a reasonable for me
the lifetime guarantee doesn not hurt , either .
there is not much i can add to what is already been said about the koss portapro headphones
these have got to be one of the best values out there today
sound is phenomenal
comfort ( for me ) is very good
the only area for concern that i could see was the quality of the cable/jack
i added two layers of shrink tubing at this junction to relieve stress
i think that will be sufficient
highly recommend this product .
in comparing the koss portapro with the sennheiser 201 , which is a good deal cheaper ( and also quite a bit bulkier ) , i have concluded that both headphones are amazing for the price , but they are quite different
the portapro has significantly more bass
i had to keep the volume at about <PERCENT> what i keep it at for the sennheiser
the portapro is perfect if you are really into bass , if you are really into the beat
the sennheiser is better for purity of sound
i just feel that , in general , it gives a truer , purer sound
the sound that the original artist had in his/her head
a lot of people will love the beat on this
but some people will find it overpowering
i am listening to "something" by the beatles right now , and i am pretty sure george didn not want paul is bass to dominate so much
or maybe this is the best way to put it : you know how when you go into the movie theater and the previews start playing , you are struck by how great the surround sound is ? it is so rich and bassy , you can practically feel your bones vibrate
that is what the koss portapro is like
it is great for watching movies
but it just doesn not give the purest vocal sound for music
if you want to turn up the volume to focus on the vocals , the bass will deafen you
the sound went out in one side after <NUM> months
the headphones lay on the shelf for a year , because i never got around to mailing it in for warranty ( they will replace it for you but it isn not free )
and then i decided to fix it myself , so i got a new plug from radioshack and got down and dirty with wires for an hour
after <NUM> minutes i was cursing myself for choosing to do this myself
but finally i got it to work
and to keep it that way , i am not going to use it on the move
i recommend getting a cheap pair of earbuds for when you are moving around ( the sony mdr j10 is my favorite - it stays on and it has lasted me longer than any other brand ) , and keeping these relatively more expensive headphones for use at home
as you move around , the wire bends in your pocket , and eventually the connection is severed
oh , and i agree with other reviewers that these headphones do get painful after a while
but i kind of think that is a good thing
it limits your headphone use and will probably save your hearing in the
and you do have to learn how to take them off without them pulling out your hair .
years ago i was introduced to a st of koss studio pros
they were actually a headphone which looked very similar to these
they were lightweight , very comfortable , and had the most amazing clarity
it seems to me that koss has simply miniaturized the very same koss headphones i had years ago
they are lightweight , very comfortable , and retain the same clarity of the larger phones i used to have
these are excellent for listening to acoustic music as well as rock
the highs are crisp and clean and bass is fat and full , but not overwhelming like the dre is
one of the things that i noticed more so than other headphones i have own is the separation of sound
you can distinguish the left and right channel clearly
it totally adds to the listening experience
my only complaint is , as far as i know , koss has discontinued the version of this headphone which i used to have
i would like to see it on the market again , but until then , i am very pleased with these .
the 'gold' plug on these earphones is slightly smaller than regulation which causes the right earphone to cut out on some devices
i bought two of these puppies and they are both defective
the problem does not show up until they have been used for some hours ( weeks ) .
i use to own these same headphones back in the 80 is and they are still dynamic ! i would recommend these headphones to anyone !
these audiophile headphones have no business being less than $40
well , they kind of do
they sound great and have audio design by john bruss
the sound imaging is pretty amazing and they respond beautifully in their frequency range at all volumes
i wear them for ~7 hrs per day at work and they are not as fatiguing as earbuds
the look is very 80s , so you def won not have to worry about people stealing your surprisingly awesome headphones
the headband can grab your hair if you pull them on over your head , so make sure to pull them open before putting them on
they saved money on the industrial design , but spared no expense on the audio quality .
do you wanna look like a jogger from 1982 ? do you want your music to sound fantastic at the same time ? these are your headphones
seriously , they sound excellent .
they are a little overated do sound muddy depends on the track you listen to but highs never sound like they should
i wouldnt say there bassey but more of a swamped out muffled
you could do better if you look around but there not bad but if you own these they cant be you only pair
koss porta pros are the headphone of choice if you like to listen loud with deep bass
they have a bit of trouble boosting treble because of this , but they are well balanced for most recordings so it doesn not really matter
many have complained about the headphones being too tight , but i have a pretty big grape and have no trouble wearing these on a two hour walk
i use these with my awesome archos jukebox recorder 10 , and they are a killer combo
many mp3 players sacrifice a resonable amp for smaller size , so these porta pros will help salvage players with diminutive amps
the only complaint with my porta pros is they are open ear , and people are always noticing my music , even though they all admit i am not listening that loud once they try them on .
read all the reviews before buying it and had expected more
but in reality i really should not have since i didn not pay too much for it
the main thing that really dislike about it is that the collapsing mechanism isn not stiff enough and i find i have to make sure i am putting it on with both hands or else the headphones will fold in
other than that i think it is okay
i am not much of an audiophile so i will leave the sound quality and what not to those in the know .
if you love the bass in the music , this is your headphones ! this is a real killer with high expression of basses , high quality sound , good , comfy ( but you probably will feel uncomfort in an hour , it causes sweating and heating in ears after some time ) , and in contrast to style arguments of other reviews , pretty stylish with its blue color and metal connection
i strongly recommend the product
especially given its price .
i bought these koss proporta headphones after getting tired of the small headphones
i have had a bunch of them , including bose and bang & olufsen
these are better than any of those
i was just looking for something to use with my computer at work
i don not use them a lot , but am now finding myself using them a lot more than i used to
for what i wanted these for and for the price , not sure how you can beat them
i have also had the bose noise canceling headphones , but they are so big and bulky that i just don not carry them with me when i travel
several of the reviews commented on how hard it was to get these into the storage bag that comes with them
i did not find it a problem at all
they fold up and hook together and easily fit inside the bag
they are super comfortable ( my hair is short so the hair pulling isn not an issue )
the way they are built , they will probably last forever or at least until i get tired of them
i wouldn not hesitate a moment to buy these
hey if you don not like them , you are only out about $30
i am not a sound expert , so they sound pretty darned good to me and much better than all the small ones i have been using .
very deep bass for such little headphones needs a break in period top of head set can be a little uncomfortable in extended use other than that great value
ha widths years ago
design looks a bit lighter than back then but has added fit switch ( tight or loose ) which is nice
as ever great sonice and the price i got it for ( $25 ! ) was a steal
great choice for comfortable home use and moderately active outdoor performance !
i was seeking new headphones to replace my ipod nano headphones which are pathetic
i had some koss earbud headphones that i loved but lost , so i needed new ones
so i came on here to find reviews of other headphones and saw that the reviews for the portapro were great
since i had a great experience with koss in the past ( they replaced my earbuds on my old phones for free , no questions asked ) , i decided to try these
the reviews are
i'd describe the sound of these phones as if two of the best speakers you have ever heard were on both sides of your head
the sound is great at all volumes
the clarity is such that i can hear parts of songs that i never heard before
the lows , mids , and highs are perfect
some headphones sound bad at high volumes , and the sound gets muddy and the bass sort of shakes in your ear
well you don not get that with these
it is like you are in the studio recording with the band
you can tell the difference between a 160kbps , 192kbps , and a 256kbps mp3 file with these headphones
the only thing i don not like about them is that i can hear outside noise , like cars whizzing by ( a good thing , i guess ) or the engine on the bus
this can be kept to a minimum by turning the volume up
the headphones look big because of the "headrests" they have , but they are ergonomic
i was playing a video game while listening to these phones at forgot they were on because i didn not feel them on my head
they have three comfort settings : light , medium , and firm
they also come with a little case which is nice
the phones fold up to the size of a baseball , and both speakers fold inward
a small clip exists on the bottom of each phone , which attaches both sides together when you fold them
you then wrap the cord up and go
they can fit into a typical pocket
these are portable headphones , and i don not know why people say otherwise
they are some of the best headphones i have ever heard
no surprise koss makes them
they are also manufactured in the usa so there is no outsourcing of jobs with these phones
i can understand why these phones have been on the market since the 1980s
they are fantastic .
to anyone who hasn not tried all the various types of headphones , it is important to remember exactly what these are : cheap portable headphones
they give a totally different sound then or closed design phones , but for what they are i would say they are good
i currently own six pairs of phones , from stock apple earbuds to sennheiser hd 518s
gave my portapros a run on both my computer is sound card and mp3 player , using <NUM> kbps mp3s or better
the clarity is good and they are very lightweight
the folding design is simple but effective
the look is certainly retro and unique , although i didn not find it as comfortable as many have claimed
earpads are *very* thin and made my ears sore after <NUM> minutes of listening , although this can be remedied to a point by adjusting the "comfort zone" feature ( tightening the temple pads while loosening the ear pads )
the cord seems to be an average thickness , but i wouldn not get too rough with these
the steel headband adjusts smoothly and easily , just watch out that the slider doesn not catch your hair
despite the sore ears , the phones are very lightweight overall
back to the sound : as you would expect , it is good for a portable phone , but hardly earth shattering
at flat eq the clarity is good , although the highs can sometimes be harsh
bass is weak as expected , even with eq adjusted up
to be fair , a portable would have a tough time comparing to the bass of an with a good seal or a pair with larger drivers
no sound isolation offered if you are into that sort of thing
cool 80s phones , though i have certainly owned better portable ( sony makes excellent phones in this category )
soundstage is very narrow and lacks body
a good value if you can get them for under thirty , otherwise i'd rather invest in a nicer pair of phones
if we are talking about value , they are a good buy compared to new stock apple buds
if you are trying to compare the sound quality of this product to serious headphones , there is really no comparison at all
update : after <NUM> hours of time the sound has not been affected in any appreciable way
highs are still harsh , and bass is still underwhelming
i sometimes use these as a convenience but they have been largely replaced in my collection .
being a headphone freak since i was first turned on to them in <NUM> viet nam
i find these to be a good pair to use with my portable cd player while working at my p
i have numerous and sundry headphone , from high end sennheiser , to junky chepos that i purchased because of my headphone fetish
i even own a couple of the vaunted sound canceling phone
i have always liked koss products , especially my old pro 4aas
these porta pros have a warm sound and as i like my music loud sometimes and soft and low sounds other time , they are perfect for me
i would give them a hearty thumbs up .
if comfort is your issue , these headphones do the job
i have very sensative ears
these heasdphones direct the pressure away from your ears and it is much more evenly distributed than any headphones i have tried ( besides my super expensive noise cancelling headphones .
these are awesome headphones
i work in a crowded ( load ) office , and there are days that would be almost unbearable without these headphones
i am able to crank up the volume , and the sound quality is excelent
the bass produced from such a small package is remarkable
i did have to replace one set of the cushions after a few years , and eventualy one of the speaker wires started to short out
koss stood behind their lifetime warrenty , and replaced the unit
the first pair of headphones i bought ( in the '80s ) were from koss , and my experiences with their lifetime warrenty has made me a lifetime customer .
most cheap headphones claim they can reproduce bass down to <NUM> hz but these are the only ones that even come close to matching that claim
the clarity and durability of these headphones is also amazing .
i adore these headphones ! i am really hard on them and use the things almost daily
they get shoved into my bag , ripped out , tossed around , and stuff like that
other than the time i stepped on one of the plastic sides and snapped it ( but superglue fixed everything ! ) they are just the same as when i got them last year
i tried using the blue tabs to adjust how tight they are but didn not have any success
bass and sound quality is superb
whenever mine break i am getting another pair !
i have owned a pair of koss back when they first came out and could not believe the sound from these headphones
i have tried other brands but have never had as good of a frequency response that these headphones can produce
i will never buy any other pair of over the ear headphones as long as they keep these in production
they are that good .
i own <NUM> each of grado sr 80 , sennheiser rs <NUM> and both the koss sportapros and portapros
the sound you get with the portapro is as rich to me as the grado sr 80
its amazing that such a light headphone can produce the same rich highs and deep lows
accuracy is no problem for the portapros since there is not much material
between the portapros and sportapros , i think the portas sound better ( the sportapro has developed a light distortion with bass , the reason i recently purchased the portapro )
the sportas metal band does not slip as much as the porta but the porta again with an adjustable "comfort zone" setting for the temporal pads
, i like the more masculine look of the portas over the sportas and never used the configuration of the sportas .
i bought these headphones based on suggestions and reviews i'd read on the internet
i wanted something with decent sound and comfort that wouldn not break the bank ; i will be traveling abroad for a semester , and needed something with which to enjoy my music without the comfort of my micro stereo
i wasn not sure what to expect as i am not much of an audiophile , but i was very pleased with the portapros
they are very comfortable , provide ample bass and overall sound quality , and fold up to make them quite portable to boot ( go figure )
the included case and 1/4" audio adapter were nice bonuses
i am using them with an ipod and my laptop , both sound even better than my stereo with the portapros
only thing i dislike is that the hook to keep them latched together in "travel mode" doesn not hold all that well
if you buy them , consider getting some of the foam ear pad replacements to go with ( koss portable replacement cushions )
the headphones will last , but the pads might eventually tear ( they did on my old sony headphones ) .
as a drummer i normally opt for bigger headsets that are enclosed , especially for playing electronic drums
the problem is that they don not let your head & ears breathe , making it uncomfortable to wear for long sessions
i bought these with the intention of using them for my mp3 player , but i thought , why not give them a try with the kit
wow ! these cans really pump
the frequency range was something i totally did not expect , especially when monitoring a live electronic music instrument - drums no less ! these headphones handled the pounding drum sounds perfectly and with no fatigue at all
i was able to also hear other live instruments as well
the only drawback is the level at which these headphones start to distort out
( now this is a level which i believe is way beyond normal listening levels - remember , this is from a band rehearsal at full volume
) so , during a solo practice session , these did a phenominal job
however , it is a lot to ask these headphone to be the primary monitor cans during a full blown gig - the sound pressure levels are too much
but , if you are looking for great headphones that are comfortable to where for long periods and sound fantastic , then these are the ones ! i highly recommend them !
sweet , cheap , glorious sounding phones
get a volume control ( also koss ) and you are all set
cord is a bit short , but plugged into the volume control you will have plenty of length
these are really excellent sounding phones
i couldn not believe the difference between a couple of other cheap ones i have
highly recommended ! these have been highly regarded for many years , and i recall having had a pair maybe <NUM> years ago
also you may want to buy some replacement foam pads
i use mine outside and they get a lot of sweat on them
changing pads is a breeze .
these are the best pair of headphones i have ever used
i only had to buy this pair because i somehow broke my last pair ( had for over <NUM> years )
the breaking was all my fault ; nobody should expect a pair of headphones to survive being run over by a car
mea culpa ! seriously though , the audio is the best i have ever heard from canceling headphones
i use these on walks and jogs , so i need something that doesn not completely drown out ambient noise
they do drown out softer noises ( much more than earbuds ) so be careful !
so here goes another comparison between the koss portpros and the sennheiser 100 is ? i am not going to bore you
both headphones are outstanding performers with an ipod
i own them both
so which one is my preference ? the sennheisers , for one reason only
people use their ipods in malls and on the go
there are times when i want to remove the phones from my ears for a few moments ( say , in a store or when having conversation )
with the sennheisers , i can remove the phones from my ears and let them "hang" around my neck in comfort
try this with the koss is and they will place a stranglehold on you
for this reason alone , i recommend the senn is
both , in my humble opinion , sound equally good .
i need to say it up front : these are the ugliest headphones ever
with that out of the way , i can heap mounds of praise upon them
sound is paramount , of course , and these are no exception
i sort of prefer the sound of these to some of the headphones ( which i think sound like a cave sometimes )
they almost sound good as the sennheiser <NUM> ( not as good , of course , but still impressively close , given their price )
they are exceptionally comfortable
at the risk of sounding corny , they feel like wearing air
they can folded up to very small dimensions , a nice plus .
while you are shopping just remember this fact : koss portapro--rockin out nonstop since <NUM> because of overwhelming customer demand
there is one solid fact about the performance of portable headphones and that is it
go with the proof .
i bought these headphones a few years ago , after reading all the glowing reviews on amazon , and i am so glad i did
i am pretty rough with my headphones , and these things can take a beating
i ended up replacing a pair after <NUM> years , which is unbelievable in itself , because i usually go through a pair of headphones every six months
and it wasn not because they didn not work , it is just because the wire near the jack was exposed and getting frayed
here are all the pros : value : they are a great value for the money
i have had more expensive headphones that didn not sound as good
even if you don not want to spend dollars for headphones and don not care what they sound like , i still think it would be worth it , because you won not have to replace them every six months when something breaks on them
these headphones are very durable and aren not made of flimsy plastic like less expensive ones are , so in the long run , they would be worth it
comfort : these are very comfortable
there are <NUM> settings , tight and loose , to adjust for different head sizes
i have never had a problem with the ear pads wearing out or anything digging into my ears , or whatnot
these fit very comfortably on my head ( i have a big head btw ) and i have never had a problem with them sliding off
portability : these aren not the smallest earphones in the world , but certainly not the biggest
they do fold up if you need to pack them and they come with a little pouch to put them in
i bring them along on trips on all the time and i have never had a problem with them
sound quality : they sound fantastic ! better than a lot of more expensive headphones
though any headphone with the koss name sounds great , i think these are the best
just the right amount of bass and treble
doesn not sound tinny , or like you are playing music in a tunnel
if you are used to less expensive headphones , you are going to hear stuff in your music you never heard before
ease of use : well , most headphones aren not hard to use , and these are the same
the only drawbacks to these is i found it hard to adjust to loose/tight setting on the sides and they are sort of of a pain to fold up ( which is why i never fold them up )
i have owned foldable headphones that were much worse though
build : awesome ! the headband is metal and the casing for the earphones are hard plastic and very durable
not long ago , i accidently broke off one of the earpieces
guess what , it pops right back in ! five stars for build ! i have never buy another pair of headphones , ever
i bought <NUM> pairs of these , ( one for home , one for the gym , and one to replace the ones from home ) and i plan to buy more in the future , if need be
i love love love these headphones
the only slight con i can think of is they aren not isleek' looking like other headphones , in fact they look like they came straight out of 1982
i don not really care what they look like though , and quality of these headphones more than make up for the ugliness .
i am hard on headphones
i use them at work all day long and they get a work out
i have gone through <NUM> sets less than a year and a half
when these arrived , i groaned
they appeared much flimsier than i expected
well , more than six months later , these phones are going strong
sound is good , quality is good
there ya go ! these have been around forever
i think i am figuring out why .
they look old school but these things are awesome
i bought the replacement pads too but haven not had to use them yet
the sound quality is amazing and you don not lose anything like you sometimes do with noise canceling headphones .
really though ? maybe its because i have listened to much better before
if you use the sennheiser cx300 , this will sound like crap
no sound isolation , i already knew that , but i thought everything else would make up for it
there is like no bass , barely any
the volume sucks , has to be louder
at first , after reading all these awesome reviews , i thought i was going crazy
but i plugged them into my computer , my mp3 , my ipod , my stereo system
they are horrible
i expected this , most over the head earphones have leather cups , these had foam
they make your ears hot
and they exhibit horrible sound
oh man , returned these the next day
have to pay shipping costs
don not buy these
worth like <NUM> bucks
and they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them .
i really wanted to love these
after reading rave reviews about their quality and history , i thought these would be great for listening to music and podcasts at the office
for years , i have been wearing a pair of cheapo earbuds ( philips flexible earhook headphones shs3200/28 ( black ) ( replaces shs3200/37 ) ) that were extremely comfortable and got the job done , but i decided it was time to upgrade to something with better sound
, i honestly wasn not blown away by these
yes , they offer more bass than most portable headphones , but the bass on these strikes me as muddy and overpowering
in terms of comfort , after several hours of use , my ears started to ache from the pressure of the headband even with the "comfort zone" switches set to the lightest setting
in contrast , i can wear my $8 philips earbuds all day with no fatigue or discomfort
this might not be an issue if you are not planning on extended listening sessions ( they are fine for an hour or so ) , but if you are planning on wearing them for longer periods , you are in for a headache .
i think these are great for the price , but they lack low end bass as they are compact , and the padding simply isn not there , to keep space to a minimum once again , but overall , i am very much happy with them
keep an eye out for a video review on the sonicorbstudios youtube channel for more : )
i have purchased <NUM> sets of these over the years for my son and his mother
<NUM> of the <NUM> are still going strong
my son has managed to destroy a pair of these and bunches of others but i digress
in every way possible these are great headphones
portable , easy to use , sufficient bass , and fairly priced to boot
if i used an player of any kind i'd have a pair of these
since i am more a stereo kinda guy , my big boy sennheisers fill my bill
i have used these headphones on occaision however and can not recommend them more highly
da worfster
you notice more sounds with these headphones
this is one example of traditional electronics that will never be beat , especially at this price .
sure these headphones look a bit wierd
a matter of taste at best
however the sound is great ! whether the source is a smartphone , tablet or pc this is an excellent sounding headphone for the price .
i felt inclined to write a review because i was so impressed by these headphones
i had tried a bunch in the process looking for headphones in the $150 range , tried bose oe ( $180 ) , sony xb700 ( $90 ) , pioneer home theater a1000 ( $95 ) , sony v700 ( $85 )
out of the more expensive headphones i thought the bose oe sounded the best ( very clean crisp highs , and great bass and very comfortable )
the only headphones that came close to the bose oe ( in terms of sound ) were these koss portapros and they cost 1/6th the price ! some people were saying the new design of the cable meant that they are using cheaper materials or something ? totally untrue , the headphones feel and look great , are comfortable enough for a good couple hours , and sound amazing ! even if you plan to buy some expensive headphones i really think you should have a pair of these
i actually just ordered a $350 pair of denon d2000 , but i don not regret the portapros one bit , they are awesome , great bass , good mids and highs ( albeit not as good as the bose , but close enough considering the drastic price difference )
update ( after <NUM> month use ) : recently i purchased some denon d2000 and beyer dynamic t990 ( both retail over $300 ) i still can not believe how good the koss stand up to them
for fun i tried connecting the koss to my nuforce hp ( amp/dac ) and they sound even better ; mind you the denons and beyers have more clarity but once again considering the cost of the koss it is worth purchasing for portable use even if you have expensive headphones
still impressed !
i have been listening to these for years and years
for the price they are simply amazing
great bass response
crystal clear highs
wonderful for all kinds of music : pop , rock , jazz , classical , soundtracks
i actively go out and listen to the competition all the time
i did just order the sennheister px 100s because evidently they edge past the koss headphones
i find this hard to believe , but we will see
i do love the bose q2 is and plan to get those for home and travel
but when it comes to serious street bopping : for the koss
you will not be sorry ! promise .
i got my portapro phones yesterday , and i am frankly disappointed
my intention was to use these phones with my computer for music listening at late hours
i was instantly defeated by the useless cord length
i should have checked that out , but managed to miss it
nearly every headphone designed for home use ( as these originally were ) , come with at least five or six feet of
so right there , i was out of luck
oh well , i thought , i can always use them with my mp3 player
my second discovery is that koss , like many headphone manufacturers , is targeting it is smaller phones for the highly lucrative ipod market
this means that the guys in marketing are calling the shots
not surprisingly , the phones have a that is right for the ipod crowd but not home users
further , the sound has the exaggerated bass popular with kids into , but at the cost of a balanced natural sound
i would describe the sound as smooth and quite pleasant , but rather unnatural
the low end is very exaggerated and the is down about 5db
the highs are also way down , perhaps <NUM> or 8db
using my players equalizer i can make the sound acceptable , but these phones are typical of the "bass is what the kids are buying" school of design
without a lot of tone control effort you should expect a sound that lacks any definition in the midrange
i am a lifelong headphone listener who has used grado , sennheiser , akg , and even electrostatics
i know good phones
these disappoint
i suspect that most of the reviews reflect people who don not use headphones much
one other point
koss has been praised for it is generous warranty
maybe , but read the fine print
koss will replace or repair the phones ( their option ) , if you provide a check for $6 and suitable packaging
picture that
i spend $6 for repairs , $3 for a shipping box requiring a visit , another $6 for shipping , and still another trip to the
some lifetime warranty
incidentally , i would estimate the phones cost a maximum of $5 to make
seriously , i base this estimation on material costs and the manufacturing processes , which i am familiar with
in conclusion , i cannot recommend these phones to anyone who values balanced sound over punchy bass .
i remember seeing these in way back in college
hard to imagine that they are still making them , or that they are really still that good ! perhaps the latter is the reason for the former
you can spend a couple hours online reading one review after another after &<HASHTAG> ; best bang for the buck headphones under $100
&<HASHTAG> ; yeh , i did that
or you can just take <NUM> seconds and click &<HASHTAG> ; add to cart&<HASHTAG> ; and get them delivered to your door in a day or so
really , you are not going to be sorry
no , really .
things i like : - metal band seems durable and is easy to adjust- sound quality- affordable price ( i am not an audiophile , don not want to spend $100+ on headphones but i still want headphones of significantly higher quality than earbuds ) - lightweightthings i don not like : - nothing so fari wanted some higher quality headphones for use with my desktop computer ; i found many quality headphones at the $100+ price point but wasn not looking for headphones
i just wanted a medium to quality pair at a decent price that would provide better quality sound than your standard headphones
after reading many reviews and doing a lot of research , i found the portapros and am happy with them
the sound is more rich , bass comes through surprisingly well without sacrificing the high end
they are comfortable to wear for an <NUM> to 1
5 hours at a time and are very lightweight so you don not always "notice" them on your head
i don not carry them around anywhere , but the mechanism does make these pretty portable if that is what you will use them for
i am very pleased with these and would purchase them again ; they come with a lifetime warranty though , so i may be set for life
i am sure there higher quality headphones out there that produce much better sound than these ; the portapros produce great sound for the average to slightly discerning listner and are priced affordably
to give you a better idea about the portapro is sound quality , 0=worst , fuzzy , crackly sound that makes it seem like your listing to a poorly tuned am station10=best , sitting in an acoustically designed room listening to cutting edge , $10 , 000+ plus speakerspair of $25 jvc earbuds i got at walmart and junked within <NUM> minutes : 1stock ipod earpieces : 3my vizio soundbar ( with subwoofer ) : 7koss portapros : 5surround sound system : <NUM>
well , i have had these for quite a while , and they are simply amazing in regards to sound quality , especially for the price
the sound quality is a solid <NUM> stars
they have very crisp and accurate sound reproduction , a spacious soundstage , wonderfully controlled response , and mids and highs that are just the right balance of warm and bright sound
they are clean and not sibilant at all
the only down side is the design
they are awkward to adjust and to wear
they also tend to pull your hair
the temple pads are a dumb idea on headphones that are so light and not
they also will not fit into or out of their included soft case without almost destroying them
but for sound quality alone these are absolutely untouchable at anywhere near the price range
when i am really needing a portable headphone i usually go with the soundmagic e10 is
they aren not quite as nice to listen to as these koss porta pros , but they also block out outside noise and are still amazing to listen to
they absolutely trounce any other earbuds i have listened to for under $70 .
i am actually surprised they still work after so long ! they have decent quality ( nothing compared to a more expensive brand , but still better than in earbuds ) , and they are strong
i have sat on them and squashed them , yet they still stayed together and kept their shape perfectly
the problem i had with them was the u shape of them would always get caught on other cables and chords and trust me , that is so frustrating ! also , they always close automatically so you have to resize them every time you put them on
didn not mind either of these things the first few months , then they eventually start getting to you , trust me on this
overall , for this price , they are good , durable portable headphones with good sound , but those gripes i have lead me to not recommend them to constant music listeners .
i have tried to give koss praise for these all over the internet where ever i can
these headphone just do not get enough credit
they are small , hold well on your head and sound fantastic
granted if you want full on studio get big $200 to $400 dollar over the ear headphones , but for a reasonable second place when you are jogging at the gym , these are the ticket
i have bought about <NUM> or <NUM> pairs and plan to buy these for the rest of my life unless i hear something better
that hasn not happened in a decade so far
the best
try them out !
after hearing the crisp , full sound of my cousin is koss portapro headphones , i had to buy a pair of my own , especially after the fact that my awesome old skullcandy headphones failed after <NUM> 1/2 years of service
awesome , they arrived <NUM> days earlier than originally projected , so i open the box to find a shiny new pair of koss portapros
i had about <NUM> minutes to sample the awesomeness before i had to go to work , so i fold them up ( neat design , by the way ) and fit them into the tight ( as in physical , not fashionable ) carrying pouch and set them on my dresser
the next day , i have more time to actually use these guys , so i pull them out of the pouch
this is where i need to warn buyers before getting these headphones
the pouch is too tight , when you pull the headphones out , no matter how careful you do it , one or both of the earpieces will snap where it swivels
]update : never mind the warranty is amazing !
for the price , there is simply no other set of headphones that will provide as warm and beautiful a soundspace
it is that simple .
this is my second pair of portapro 'phones , and my third pair of headphones using these drivers
they may just be the best headphones i have ever owned- they are not perfect , but they have proven sturdy , they travel well , and they sound great
no kidding ; the only headphones i have used that sounded better were the expensive bose sort , so i consider this money well spent
drawbacks : a little pricey
i bought the first pair for under $25 on a competing site , so you might do better with another vendor
the steel band can be a little uncomfortable , but hasn not been for me
bottom line , these are a great buy and i look forward to using them for a long , long , long time .
i have been wanting a great set of headphones for years and finally took the time to research them and checked with before i purchased anything
i am so glad that i got these , they are so very comfortable ( even with brand new ear piercings ) and sound incredible
i am also very happy to find out they have a lifetime warranty .
my daughter didn not have a nice pair of headphones and we looked these up on amazon and cnet loved them so for christmas i bought them for her
she loves them &<HASHTAG> ; 3
how often can you really "feel" the music ? well , now that is possible with the porta pro from koss
just got mine and they are incredible
amazing is too short to describe the experience
highly recommended .
i have had these headphones for <NUM> years , and the headphones are great
but more than that , koss is amazing
if there is a short , a problem ( and there have been about <NUM> over the years ) , they give you a lifetime warranty on the headphones , and have either fixed or replaced them for a nominal charge to cover shipping and handling
i recommend any koss headphones not just because the sound is really good , but because they stand behind their product .
first thing i thought when i heard of these headphones : really ? people like these ? they are so ugly ! needless to say , i stopped worrying about how good they looked as soon as i heard how good they sounded
they have amazing bass and the highs and mids are clear without getting distorted or drowned out
the construction seems flimsy , but as others have pointed out , there is a lifetime warranty on these ( although you have to pay for s&h ; )
they are light on the head and i can wear them for hours without any fatigue
however , they are a good amount of sound , so i wouldn not recommend listening to them in quiet areas like libraries or on a commute
all in all though , i hate to sound cliche : but this really is one of the best headphones for the price .
fit only , pressure adjustment flimsy
sound quality very good but not outstanding ; sound leaks very noticeable .
i have had these wonderful phones for three months
i use them for my ipod classic
the sound is rich and full
strong bass with no distortion , even at high levels
listening to fleetwood mac is "dreams" makes the song sound like a dream
you can hear stevie make sighs and sounds you don not hear on the cheap ipod earbuds
and when you listen to led zeppelin is "moby dick , " it feels like you are sitting right next to john bonham as he pounds on the drums
it is unbelievable how good these phones are
when you listen to the counting crows' acoustic version of "amiee , " with its mandolin intro playing in the left ear , and rich acoustic guitar coming through on the right ear , you will have an eargasm , baby ! it is an experience ! the portapros are also , hands down , the most comfortable headset i have ever worn
you can adjust them to fit tighter or more loosely around the ears , and the extra padding really helps with the comfort
i should say that these are not noise cancelling or sound isolating
i can not wear them in bed at night because even with the volume 1/3rd up on the ipod , my wife can hear them
same thing with riding the train or bus
you won not want to wear them in public , partly because they look like something worn on the set of the <NUM> flick tron , and partly because your neighbors won not want to listen to your music
but if you care about excellent quality sound , and you are not disturbing anyone , these are the best sounding headphones you can buy under $50
they are a big step up from the ipod earbuds and a bigger step up from anything walmart sells
i should say that these sound better on mp3 players than they do on equipment
i definitely prefer my beloved grado sr125s for listening with my stereo or with my laptop
but the portapros are a steal at $38
i almost forgot to mention that there is a lifetime warranty on the portapros
if they accidently break , and you still have your receipt , koss replaces them for free
awesome !
i have bose acoustic noise cancelling headphones which i paid $150 while this koss headphones i paid $25 ( black friday deal )
i can say i love this headphone way more than bose
<PERCENT> recommended .
i bought this item after going through so much research
i was interested in this because it is in cnet is top <NUM> and so many good reviews in amazon
so i don not think one more elaborated review is not necessary but i want to focus on some issues specifically
1 ) comfort : i bought a sony ( for it is extreme comfort and good sound quality ) after i buying koss portapro thinking that koss is pressing my ears too hard because , my ears were paining after listening for couple of hours
afterwards i noticed that pain is not because of the pressing alone but because of the high bass from koss
if you listen at little less volume it shouldn not be a problem
2 ) mechanical issues : there are glides on the headphone for light and firm wear but when i put them in light mode they just don not stay there
they come to firm position once i touch the phones
one more thing , unless you pull the metal bands to the end they try to collapse
this is not an annoying problem for me because i have a big head
slowly my ears are used to this , and i can listen for longer times and i am listening at low sound levels
so i changed my decision to return these and i am keeping them
just to list the pros and cons i experienced
pros : best sound quality , light weight , portable , extra bass ( you love it ) , cons : design not up to the mark , mechanical issues like glides not staying in their position
extra bass ( you can hurt your ears ) .
suits my needs almost perfectly
a great balance of quality construction , design , price and sound
all that and a life time warranty from a company with a solid reputation
i love these headphones .
probably not fair to compare these to my last set which were px100s and cost considerably more , so i won not do that , cause px100s they are not
that said they are decent enough for the price
i was a bit spectacle on how comfortable they would be since i shave my head and these have no pads , but they fit fine , stay on my head and are comfy enough
they produce decent sound although somewhat muddy and not as crisp as the px100s for sure
but since they are mainly for the time i spend on the stair master at the gym , the sound quality is more than adequate
they block most of the background noise , but i can still hear a bit of what is going on around me which is not a bad thing
as for portability , they fold up small enough , but not small enough to fit easily in the carry bag that is provided , which is pretty much useless
without it , it is a pain since i keep them in a pocket of my gym bag and without some sort of small carry bag the cord easily gets tangled
for some reason it wants to maintain the original coiling it had in the packaging
hopefully over time it will straighten a bit
not a big deal though and i can make do with some other bag for storing them
how well they hold up is yet to be seen
i am pretty hard on my headphones and have yet to have a pair last more than two years
they look solid enough but i have my doubts
for the price though , it is not a big deal
overall i am happy with the purchase and would say the rating on these is about right .
i am a live sound engineer
i have many pairs of headphones
i love these for personal listening with mp3 players , phones , portable digital audio devices
great for travel
i have purchased several of these
they sound way better than you'd think .
not being familiar with the koss brand i was hesitant to order these headphones but with all of the consumer reviews being four stars and higher i decided to buy a pair
they are small , what you would expect from a cheap portable set
however , the sound blows me away
i hear every little nuance of the music
the bass is very present , the highs are crisp and clear
well done koss ! they are comfortable to wear , easy to get a good fit with minimal adjustments
they do seem fragile , only time will tell
get a pair , hear for yourself
i am quite surprised and very happy with mine .
i have worn out two pair of these phones in the last decade
the sound quality was great
wonderful bass--the only phones with better have been phones that fully cover my ears--and aren not really &quot ; portable
&quot ; these stayed comfortable for the excruciatingly long flights from socal to northern norway , even while wearing glasses
they fold up nice and small , easy to tuck away
they also performed adequately while watching airline movies
more than saved the price of the phones over several trips ! i have two complaints : 1 ) hair easily penetrates the &quot ; speaker grill&quot ; and makes irritating noise against the actual speaker membrane
2 ) the speaker , while reproducing sound well , can develop tears in the membrane easily
be careful ! nothing is more annoying than a buzzing speaker at 33 , 000 feet ( well , perhaps sudden cabin depressurization
) ! my second pair wore out about the same time as my vintage walkman
i replaced the setup with a nomad ii mg &amp ; a pair of noise cancelling headphones--they make a _huge_ difference ! five stars for sound quality
five stars for comfort
five stars for portability
five stars for durability
if you are not going to spring for noise cancellation and you need a folding pair of phones , then get a pair of portapros .
i own <NUM> pairs of headphones and several more have been and gone
by far , the portapros are my favourite for portable music
long walks with the dogs , bike riding , train travel , plane travel
the sound these little babies pump out belies their size
truly excellent acoustics for such a small package
not many companies these days offer a lifetime guarantee
says a lot about this product
some people are unsure of the retro look
i for one love it
they are unique in that regard , but at the end of the day , it is all about the sound and that is where these headphones excel
do yourself a favour and get some .
i know there are a million great reviews for these phones
i am speaking directly to longevity now
i got koss portapro phones ages ago , i think i got mine in 1998
seriously : i bought them specifically for listening to ftp- begotten mp3 files before i found napster
these were the best phones i ever found , for these three reasons : 1 ) they aren not monitors , so i can hear humans in my vicinity calling my name
ear goggles would not allow that
when my kids are sleeping , and i need to hear any cries in the night , this is critical
also i could use them at work
2 ) they provide excellent response range , and i assessed this in my 20 is , when i could still hear over 20mhz
3 ) and now , i swear to you fourteen years later , i am listening to the same phones , and still loving the sound quality
i have had to replace the pads , i have long since lost the case , but these are the phones hanging atop my computer monitor for when i want good sound quality with my netflix streaming
the metal has not even a blemish
fwiw , i have not had to replace the temple pads
for some reason those have not deteriorated
i don not get it , logically they should have
anyway , whenever my kids break these , i will buy another pair , with unreserved exuberance
aside : koss also oems some of the headphones for radio shack
i had a much less favorable experience with those phones
you should stick with the version
apparently even the koss factory is capable of producing crap for an oem job .
the koss portapro headphones are extraordinarily portable , as they fold and slide into an small extremely space
however , they never retain the tension setting or head band size that you set for best fit between uses ( even when not folded ) due to design limitations
they also tend to become uncomfortable to wear after a short period of time at any setting
if you do not need portability as your overriding choice factor , you can do much better with other koss headphone models or other top rated brands
so keep looking .
i'd been looking for some comfortable , affordable headphones that provide great sound and came across the reviews for these koss portapro headphones
the reviews do not lie
these are absolutely perfect for my purposes
i use these with my mp3 and pmp players , as well as my blackberry curve if i am listening to music on it , and have found the sound to be phenomenal
now , i am no audiophile but these definitely give me more detail than previous headphones i have owned so i am very happy with them
they are also extremely comfortable
i needed some phones because i have always found earbuds and phones to be painful after awhile ( i wear glasses , which are a definite factor )
these have been very comfortable on my ears and i can wear them for hours
i have not had the hair catching issue that some people mention , so i have been lucky with that as well
definitely worth the price , and if they ever break down i know koss will provide me with a new pair
i know they may look a little strange , but i have never had people comment on that - they just want to know if they are good and what kind they are
the only con is i wish the wire to connect to my devices was a little longer - not a lot , but just a few inches to provide a little extra give
however , most headphone wires are wayyy too long , so this is a very minor con
these are not phones , and they were not purchased for use on planes ( i have some foam ear buds i use for that purpose ) so i can not comment on how they would work in that situation - i think too much noise would definitely get through
so just use these in everyday situations ( walks , in cars when others are driving , etc
) where it is actually a good thing to hear some of what is going on around you for safety purposes
all in all , i am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend these headphones to anyone .
i bought a pair for my family computer <NUM> years ago
aside from replacing the ear pads once in the <NUM> years - they have sounded phenomenal and have provided years of good and satisfying use ! the independent reviews speak for themselves
allow me to put it this way : koss does not make many models of headphones , have been pulled out of bankruptcy in the 80 is because of these headphones , and have not changed the design since their introduction in 1984
with that said , these headphones keep the company profitable - so let that be a testament of how good they are
furthermore , companies do not change their designs if they struck gold - look at the german car makers and american muscle
they have not changed , have the same accents , and characteristics because you don not fix things that are not broken
sound quality : i bought akg q460s and they were horrible for the price
i had to sell those nightmares off to buy these
it served me right for considering anything but koss
after hearing such bad headphones i missed the pps because i am currently away
i needed these to remind me of home
these sound very well balanced , have great bass , and crisp mids , and lighter treble
i think that bass heads will not like these , but will nonetheless appreciate the sound quality and accuracy of these fairly neutral headphones
they do let in/out sound as they are padded and open air , but they are good for quieter environments and very comfortable
the open airs are better because the diaphragm vibrates freely which makes the bass sound less punchy and boxy
these are also very warm headphones with a presence of mids
pros : great sound and lifetime warranty
cons : they are a little awkward because of the metal band , but you will get over it when you hear how good they are
if you are buying online and don not have the time to test them
just buy these
it is a no brainer
these are the most liked and most reviewed headphones for a reason
if reviews don not convince you - i don not know what will !
i have been saying for years that these are the best headphones you can buy for under $100
that might not be correct , though
you may have to go up to $250 to find cans as good as these
for the price , they simply cannot be beat
they are light , , and they sound great
the only downside to these headphones is that if you fold them up and wrap the cord around frequently , the cord *will* break
it is not even a matter of "if" , it is a matter of "when"
i have gone through <NUM> or so pairs of these things
they are cheap though , so it doesn not bother me .
i love these , they are the best head phones on the market in my opinion
great sound , cheap , lifetime warranty
as an example : i sometimes use these when i edit movies , while others usually wear these really big and expensive ones from sennheiser or sony
one day some guy came over and almost laughed at me for using such small head phones , so i let him give it a try , and he was really impressed
the sound is nice and crispy , plays low mid and high tones equally well
i listen to black and death metal and these work really well for that .
you really can not beat the sound of the headphones for the price
they fit really well , sound amazing , look sweet and rival higher end headphones
i am going to pick up a set for work and home
even though they are portable , i still forget them
: )
i own several pairs of headphones and earbuds , ranging in price from $20 to over $500
i have had a pair of these koss portapro headphones for several months now , and used them on pcs for games and on an iphone and an ipad for games , music and video
these headhones have great sound with all the devices
i like them so well that i just ordered <NUM> more pair
it would be hard to beat them for the price .
i purchased these after reading many reviews and was not disappointed
they do not have the best high range , but decent
great mid range and surprisingly good low end for the size and style
they performed so well , that my <NUM> year old nephew ended up confiscating them as his
when i called him out on the retro style , he shrugged and said &<HASHTAG> ; have you heard these ? &<HASHTAG> ; enough said !
the sound of these cans is good but there are others that are its equal that have some better ergonomics
the ergonomics are good once you get them on , but the headband and the "tension adjustment" for the earpads are fiddly
i find that the sennheiser or the akg k420 offer equal performance with better usability and similar comfort .
comfortable , sturdy , & decent sound
i certainly would buy other koss products & i rec'd this one for those of us who can not wear those uncomfortable ear buds .
i am very pleased with these headphones
they produce great sound , are light weight and adjustable , and fold to a very compact size
my only complaint is that they came with an adapter for a large input jack ( which is very rarely found ) instead of an adapter for two prong jacks ( which are required for using these headphones on an airplane )
i couldn not even find an adapter at radio shack so ended up listening to the audio on the airplane in one ear only
oh well , otherwise they are great .
when i wear headphones i have them on for hours
i needed a pair of headphones to replace a pair of old sony mdr 20s
similar to sony v100s
ok the speaker diaphrams on the koss porta pros are very good
the problems i have with the koss porta pros is the comfort
the ear pads are smaller than most peoples ears
so the ear pads rest on the inner ridges of your ears , combine this with a spring headband that naturally wants to curl up will provide just enough tension to irritate your ears within <NUM> hours
the position locks on the sides of the headband do not lock in any way , you pick up the headphones with one hand and the earpieces flip to the inside of the headband
the cable is a little short and quite flimsy
sound good but not too comfortable
better choice sennheiser hd 201
full cup , great sound $20
outstanding bass while keeping everything else clean , at an incredible low price ; and confortable !
sound quality : decent
comfort : not good , but bearable
travel durability : abysmal
like , i went on one trip and one of the earpieces broke off at the cheap plastic pins that hold it on to the frame
i had a pair of sony is that i owned for three years and went on twenty trips with no problem
eventually the cord got frayed and i had to replace it with this piece of garbage
maybe i just had bad luck
probably not though
on my flight back , sitting between fat hick who decided to invade my seat space with passive aggressive knee touching which doesn not work with my crusty former marine mentality ( i turned that row into a warzone with that idiot ) and a neurotic aged woody allen type who had diarrhea of the mouth and couldn not shut up i reached for my trusty noise killers
only to discover to my horror that the cheap p
had broken
if somebody is little damien had been wailing behind me like my last trip it would have been unbearable .
i have had koss headphones in the past , pro 4aa and
the koss portapro is portable and has great bass response
the work great with my android phone and can be "rolled up" to be carried in my motorcycle jacket or computer bag without getting crunched
they are very light and do not feel heavy or bear down on your ears even after listening to music with them on all day
the sound is night and day better than any could be and are almost as good as the pro 4aa
they are "open air" headphones so you cannot match the bass to the sealed types , but it comes close
for $32 , you cannot go wrong .
sound great for the price and size
very portable , very sturdy , and very cheap
<NUM> star worthy on that alone
lots of bass , not the best bass but it is fun to listen too sometimes
the low end is definitely exaggerated but not like other reviews would have you believe
mids are good , a little lifeless but very god to listen too on the go
accuratish , and they aren not over emphasized
the highs , ehn
well again they aren not great but they really do sound nice , if that makes sense
they aren not perfect and at times sound a little slow but these aren not $200 can either , they can be had for $25 if you know when to buy
value : 10/10 nothing in this price range competes
build quality : 8/10 very well built but not indestructible
sound overall : 7/10 there are better portable phones
sound value : 10/10overall rating : 9/10i can not give 4
5 stars so i give it 5
on a side note my pair weren not like the picture , more like the best buy pair in one of the buyers note pictures .
i had a pair of sennheiser headphones that had about a <NUM> dollar price tag that broke
these were around <NUM> dollars and are comparable set of headphones if your looking to save a little money
granted i think the sennheiser were a little better , but you cannot beat these at this price point
they defiantly pickup on the lower range bass sounds quite well
where i think these headphones slightly lack is the midrange , and some fine detail that you get on a nice set of headphones , but that is expected at this price .
these are a bit awkward to put on at first but i assume you get used to that
from the moment you have them on , listen to music and think you are using a $350 pair of headphones
the sound quality is simply outstanding and outright unbelievable that anyone could produce something like this and sell it for this price
i just got mine and simply felt compelled to get off my bum and write a review - they are that good
they do leak a bit of sound so i would refrain from using them to listen to hard rock in a funeral ( the look may also be a bit of a giveaway ) but other than that - they are simply unbelievable
highly recommended
as far as the comparison to the px100 - my wife has those ( these were a replacement for my pair that i gave someone as a present ) and the sound quality of the koss is far better .
for the cash you can not get better
plus : clear sound , low power consumption , comfy pads minus : not really collapsible , hard to adjust firmness buttons , hair gets caught in band ( and i have very short hair )
mated with cowon is i7 , you'd think a fortune was spent for the amazing sound
not suggested for devices lacking a graphic equalizer-- top treble can get harsh without modification with higher volumes
glad i purchased the oldie but goodie .
sure , these headphones aren not exactly comparable to top of the line sennheisers or other expensive head phones but for the reasonable price i got just what i wanted , a lightweight bass prone pair of head phones that with the right eq on my ipod actually sounds very good
i carry these with me for my travels where they serve as movie and music headphones and they do a great job
would i want to take a more audiophile approach i would turn to a pair of hd 598 is or similar , but these do just what they are supposed to do
really like 'em !
an old classic
no styling changes for years
but they got it right the first time
very lightweight and excellent sound
i use grados for my serious listening , but these are just super for portable use
probably why they call them 'portapro
' only complaint , the top band is a little tweeky and thin
a wider band would render these bad boys perfect
can not do better for the bucks though
happy listening !
so i was in the market for a great pair of phones
was looking at some grados , but they are pricey
so when i found these i was a bit surprised at the specs to cost ratio
must say the look and feel great , and the sound quality is just fantastic
would definitely recommend !
for the price it sells it is not worth it , even you can fold them , and they have a good bass sound
i decided to keep it , but would not reccommend it unless the price is $ 10
purchased different koss model , much happier now , keeping both pairs .
absolutely amazing sound quality for the price
at first , they may sound a bit compared to other headphones , but once you get used to it , it sounds great
powerful and full sound
i find them super comfortable on the firm setting , but i have a narrow head i think
the additional foam pads on the temple really help the comfort level
they fold up fairly small but it is hard to fit them in the leather bag provided
i wish they came with a hard case for true protection while traveling
a great product which i would definitely buy again .
my very first set of headphones ( purchased in 1970 ) were a set of koss pro 4aa
they were heavy , rugged and sounded great when plugged into my kenwood receiver
years later , the 4aa is still sound great , but are not at all portable
the earbuds that came with my ipod sound allright , but lack bass response
i tried a set of sony earbuds
better bass , but uncomfortable
after much research , i decided to give the portapros a listen
actually , i would have loved to have found a retailer who carried the portapros so i could listen to them before purchasing , but having no luck at the local "big box" retailers , i decided to purchase the head phones via the internet and audition them at home
no dissapointment
these are a quality set of cans
great sound , great price , and a lifetime warranty as well .
these are comfortable and deliver great sound and the cost is reasonable
i also own the sennheiser px100 which also sound great and are comfortable , but cost twice as much
the sennheisers fold down a bit smaller , but it is not a big difference
the koss portapro is definitely a good quality product
good reviews from the audio experts , too .
i have been using them for almost a year now
sound is very good , not fabulous
could be a bit crisper and have more presence
if you like bass , this is your set- awesome ( too much for my taste , really )
nice not to have to stick anything inside your ear
pops open too easily when folded up
sometimes pulls at your hair when resizing it on your head
an earpad has popped out of its socket a couple of times , but it pops right back in- seems fragile but is more durable than it looks
adjusting tabs on each side reset when you take if off your head
consider whether you would rather have or inline volume adjuster before you decide
if not , it is a good choice and a good value
may <NUM> update : i had one of the cords pull out of the earpiece and sent it back to the company for a replacement- only paid shipping
they sent me a new unit
it is cheap , it is good , and it is a keeper in my book , even <NUM> years later
<NUM> update : still going strong
<NUM> update : keeps going , and going .
i work at an office and i wear headphones ~ <NUM> hours per week
and let me say that i have tried them all
everything from earbuds to , and even over the ear headphones
a friend of mine suggested the portapros to me
at first i was turned off because of the way they looked , but i decided to take a chance
once i got them on i think they look cool , and my fianc&eacute ; calls them my notron' headphones
i have actually grown to like the retro , 80 is look
but on to the sound
they sound amazing
i won not even say 'for the price'
they just sound great
i needed a headphone that were 'open air' , that way i can still hear my coworkers around me
these are , 'open air' design , but don not let that fool you
they have great bass response and sound crystal clear , no matter what the volume is
keep in mind i work in a pretty quiet environment , so i am not sure how they'd hold up on a busy city bus
the fit is also great
they are so adjustable
it took me a few days to find just the right fit , but now that i have i will never go to any other headphone for use
i have a great pair of sony 7506 is for podcasting / studio environment , but these are so great for work and travel
the way they fold up is genius , and koss even included a nice little pouch to store them in
all in all , i give it an a ! the only reason i didn not give <NUM> stars is because that the cord is just a bit too short
other than that , these headphones are a completely solid investment !
first of all , unless you have a huge fetish for retro , 80 is looking headphones , these headphones will not be pretty
they were created in the 80 is , and because they got such a great response , the company hasn not changed anything about them - including the design
however , there is no doubt whatsoever that the sound quality that comes out of these is absolutely amazing
for the price that you are paying ( about <NUM> bucks ) , these things are <PERCENT> worth the money
they appear a little flimsy , but it is pretty incredible the sound you get when you plug these things in
they also come with a larger plug for other equipment that requires it , which was really convenient for me since i got to use them for my keyboard which requires a 1/4" stereo plug instead of a 1/8"
furthermore , they are really not that fragile
i accidentally got my set jammed in my desk and popped off one of the side headphones , but it just snapped right back in and i haven not had any problems
they also have a lifetime warranty in case anything does happen to them , which is always a plus
definitely a great investment .
bought my set back in 2008 , still working as i type this
the only thing to buy with it is koss portable replacement cushions and 6ft&<HASHTAG> ; aurum cables 3
5mm male to 3
5mm female stereo audio extension cable on amazon also .
definitely one of the best sounding headphones under $50 ! well worth the money
just that it might pinch your hair .
no longer use wired headphones as i have totally switched over to blue tooth headphones
i couldn not deal with the messy wires
they worked well but they are in the pile of stuff for my local church to sell .
pretty good sound , i like more bass and these are balanced
ipod touch powers them just fine .
everyone is surprised by the awesome sound when i have them listen to these
i use them regularly at the office as well as when i travel
they collapse well for travel .
these are not what i expected based on the reviews i read & price paid
they are on the flimsy side imo & do not sound any better than most other cheaper & flimsy headphones i have tried
if i had to do it over again & would have spent more & bought some grados .
i didn not know much about this brand called 'koss'
i just simply bought this since they looked very portable , , cool , and contain some bass
apparently , this headphone almost sounds as good as my <NUM> dollar beats by bull ( ___ ) hd
for a price of <NUM> and the incredibly small size , this headphone is simply amazing
bass is reasonable enough , though some house music , metal , or dubstep can make the bass sound all and rather disgusting than clear ; however , if you want some clear bass you might wanna look at headphones around or even higher : )
other than that , i didn not find any part of its sound quality less than i expected
besides , i didn not even expect any bass to be in this tiny headphone ! i use this whenever i am doing some exercise , and so far i find no need to buy another earphone or a headphone
great job koss , i just simply love this
this is one of those "" headphones that you can use as a reference to compare other headphones with
it is the best in its class and beats many other headphones that are way more expensive
this headphone require some period ( at least <NUM> hours ) , otherwise you may find the bass to be overpowering and fatiguing , as i did at first
i put the headphone in continuous play through an amplifier for over <NUM> hrs at volume
now they sound better-- less fatiguing and more "laid back , " as the audio geeks would say
if you want more portability , try the cheaper koss
they are but sound almost the same as the portapros
i said almost , because the portapros are punchier and have more defined bass .
i loved the headphones when i first got it
but the annoyances didn not take long to appear
and they all have nothing to do with the audio quality of this product
the headphones will pull your hair , no matter how short it is
i trimmed my hair down to half a centimeter and the bands still manage to somehow yank on it
very annoying ! so as long as you are bald or intend to use these over a cap , you should be fine
otherwise , stay away
secondly , i have an issue with the durability of the cable/cord on the connector
i used this on my ipod touch for not even a whole month and the rubber had tore off
i had to use some electrical tape over that part to keep the cord from further damage
although they have an unconditional lifetime warranty , i have not gotten around to sending these back for a replacement yet .
we bought many of these for christmas for the kids ( tablets , ipods , laptops , pcs ) and the noise level in the house thanked us
the sound quality is astounding , considering the price
these far outperform anything that says beats on it , at a tiny fraction of the price ( our very brand conscious son actually bought and immediately returned a $300 pair after using these )
the sound is , again , spectacular
the comfort , however , is less than stellar ( the steel band hurts the top of their heads after a while ) , and they do cause some pretty ugly hair tangles for the girls
for intermittent use , they are fine - but in long sessions , they have been associated with frequent whining
the only real downside we have found is that the cords are outrageously frail
one yank ( trip or snag related ) , and they are toast
the conductors are so tiny that repair almost requires microsurgical procedures
it can be done , but you will need a jeweler is eyepiece , tiny fingers and a lot of patience
forewarned is forearmed .
i searched a long time for a set of portable headphones
i had a set of in ear bugs and although they were great my ears would hurt after wearing them
the koss phones are very portable and have amazing sound for the price
many people said that the bass was to much but i found that for the music i listened to it was very rich and supportive to the rest of the music
one problem is that when they retract or pull apart , your hair can get caught in them
these are also not noise cancelling phones so that you will hear a lot of external sound
for me i wear them sometimes when driving so that works perfect for me
i would recommend them as being really a good buy for the price if you are looking for a portable non noise cancelling headphone .
use it all the time on the subway
it is been used for over <NUM> years
just becareful of rolling up the cord
after a while it could lose some of it is connectivity at the head socket if your'e too rough with it , but luckily it has a lifetime warranty .
i have had a pair of koss portapro headphone since they came out about <NUM> years ago
they are the best
i believe they were once by cu
they have wonderfull bass , clear sound , are comforable to wear
they are low priced
they have a warrenty for $6 s&h repair or replacement by koss
how may other headphones have this ? you will be very happy with the portapro .
simply the best inexpensive headphone on the market
hard to believe they first appeared 20+ years ago and they still can not be beat .
out of the box these sounded a little odd , but after letting them burn in over night the sound is very smooth
the bass was ok i thought , until a really heavy bass note hit and these things showed a little more power , and much deeper bass
the build could of been better , but for a pair of on ear headphones i wasn not expecting the heaviest build , these are about just as durable as most sets of on ear
however these come with a life time warrenty
these do start to hurt my ears eventually , i keep the comfort setting to light , so i can get more hours out of these in comfort
i can say i have a set over over ear headphones which sound better then these , but also cost <NUM> times as much
for walking around , on the go , these are great , they sound good , light weight , but dorky looking
none the less i am a college nerd , so i guess it works out for me .
the space between the speaker and the temple rest is too small and it hurts the ears
if you have big ears or a big noggin , don not get these .
unbeliveable ( until you hear them ) quality for the price ! i am a musician but not much of an audiophile , tho i'd wager my hearing is slightly above average
the amount of richness ( esp base ) was surprising - i couldn not believe my laptop ( usually very sound ) and rio karma ( as compared to the sennheiser mx300 earbuds ) could output such quality tones
my brother recommended these ( he has perfect pitch and much better ears than me ) , as he uses these during his commute instead of his grado sr 125 is which were getting beat up and aren not nearly as comfortable as the koss portapros
though obviously not anywhere as 'elite' as grados or beyers , i find it impressive that these are an adequate replacement for his grado is
additionally , the tension adjustment is a really nice feature , and the cushioning arrangement works great for people who wear glasses
additionally , they look really snazzy with the metallic blue accents .
i was going to reorder another set of sennheiser because the cord started to short out at the point
i like using open air headsets at the office and while taking the pooch for a walk so that i can be aware of what&<HASHTAG> ; s going on around me
just when i was about to click &<HASHTAG> ; add to cart&<HASHTAG> ; , i noticed the suggestion at the bottom featuring the koss portapro headphones
i immediately remember these guys from back in the sony walkman days ! upon further reading reviews i decided to go for them and here&<HASHTAG> ; s what i think after a good amount of usage ( i like to &<HASHTAG> ; grade&<HASHTAG> ; my product reviews )
hope this helps
looks : 7
5 -ok , i must admit that at first i thought they looked very retro and had a nostalgic feel to them
however , as i put them on and looked at myself in the mirror , i started to feel a bit awkward and &<HASHTAG> ; dorkish&<HASHTAG> ;
that sensation intensified as i walked down the street and noticed people giving me weird looks
honestly , i really didn&<HASHTAG> ; t care , but noticed it nonetheless
build : 8
0 &<HASHTAG> ; these headphones seem well constructed
however , the thinness of the headband , which is made of an aluminum strap , is a concern
i wouldn&<HASHTAG> ; t want to overly bend it for sure
there are also a lot of moving parts and the ear plates are made of plastic
i would not advise to step or even sit on them
the cable is rather thin but overall , if you treat them with respect , they should be able to last and the lifetime warranty puts me at ease
comfort : 10
0 &<HASHTAG> ; hands down he portapro&<HASHTAG> ; s are easily the most comfortable headsets i&<HASHTAG> ; ve worn in a long time ! they&<HASHTAG> ; re super light so you&<HASHTAG> ; d hardly think they are on your head
the ear pads can feel a bit strange when first putting them on , but quickly become seamless
and they feature a slide to ease pressure , just in case
they are more comfortable and secure on my head than my old &<HASHTAG> ; s
sound : 10
0 &<HASHTAG> ; i proudly own several types of headphones from audiotechnica , to bose , to sony and even lesser known , great quality brands
i love sound ( don&<HASHTAG> ; t consider myself an audiophile ) so i don&<HASHTAG> ; t take my listening lightly
these little guys provide outstanding performance for the money ! the open nature of these headsets provides a very wide , warm , natural feel to whatever you&<HASHTAG> ; re listening to
the highs are very clear and do not &<HASHTAG> ; bleed&<HASHTAG> ; into the other frequencies
the mids are very distinctive and present
the bass is &<HASHTAG> ; punchy&<HASHTAG> ; without being overwhelming ( my &<HASHTAG> ; s were a bit too bassy )
i can listen to all genres , from rock , to hip hop to classical and equally enjoy them without adjusting the equalizer setting ( flat response )
live music is definitely a pleasure to hear with these guys
functionality : 9
0 &<HASHTAG> ; carrying them around is rather easy
they fold into a small , tight &<HASHTAG> ; ball&<HASHTAG> ; and they fit into a little pouch provided by koss
getting them into this position is easy and intuitive
they fit into any bag without taking too much space
the cord is light weight and of good length
i wish the 8mm plug was bent <NUM> because i put my portable device in my back pocket and sticks out a bit
one little gripe that most have is that when placing them on your head , the process happens automatically and you hair can get caught in the sliders
ouch ! but fortunately , that doesn&<HASHTAG> ; t happen too often
they don&<HASHTAG> ; t leak sound as much as i thought they would and that&<HASHTAG> ; s a plus
overall : 8
9 &<HASHTAG> ; i am a believer now ! while i do not use these for commuting ( subway trains ) because of the inability to block out sound , the koss portapros have become the headset to beat while walking around the neighborhood with my dog
the sound quality and comfortableness more than make up for the retro looks
highly recommended .
these headphones provide the best bang for your headphone dollar
for a sub $40 price , you can get a headphone that is better than twice its price
but it is not better than most premium headphones that cost over $200
the bass , which was great by 80s standards , can not handle the lower frequencies as well as high end shure earphones
otherwise , there is very little distortion of the sound
the level of detail in the sound is impressive
i did hear many sounds ( mainly percussion instruments and background guitar music ) which i couldn not hear with my inferior ipod headphones
but again , the level of detail is not as good as shure earphones
if you are on a budget and want to replace your uncomfortable and inferior ipod headphones with something superior , then this headphone is great
unless you want to look retro 80s , however , you may want to wear them inside .
i keep hearing about this little headphone that i just had to try it
when the opprtunity came up for me to purchase a small headphone , i jumped on it
there are countless reviews here describing about portapro
so i will skip most of things mentioned here
i will just focus on my experience with it
first of all , koss was not a known brand for me
only time i really saw their product was when i went to thrifty ( now rite aid ) and saw their cheap earphones in their electronic section
naturally , i always thought they just make cheap quality products
in last year or so , i started looking for a budget price headphone with good sound quality
and this product kept popping up in reviews and people is recommendations
i was intrigued by the fact that this product is essentially unchanged since it is launch in the mid 80 is
for $25-$35 price range headphone , i am not so sure if there are better headphones
it sounds just amazing
very full and rich low and mid sound ( not muddled but clear and balanced )
highs are not as strong but it is very well balanced with the rest of the sound range
build quality is just average
i don not mean it is badly assembled or anything like that
but even by mid 80 is standard , parts used are extremely minimalistic
some people commented on the metal adjustable band constantly shifting and not locking in its position
basically , it is not designed to "lock" into one position
if you take your headphone off , you will have to readjust the length of the metal band
another bad thing is that you just look silly wearing this thing
but i think once you hear the sound quality , you won not mind wearing it
again , for the price , i don not think you can beat it
*update : i love this headphone ! : )
this is the second pair of koss porta pros i have purchased ( wire started shorting out after a few years of repeatedly dropping my ipod )
sound quality is great for the price
they are comfortable to wear
what more can you expect .
better sound than i expected for the price i paid
they collapse easily , take up little space , and i don not have to shove them in my ears , which is nice .
i bought a pair of these a few years ago based on their popularity and stellar reviews , and i wasn not disappointed
i bought a second pair to keep handy in my basement with my home theater system for when it is late and i don not want to wake up my wife while watching a loud movie
these are very comfortable to wear ( as opposed to earbuds , which i can not stand and are generally weak on sound ) , and i haven not owned or used a pair of headphones that sound as good as these , including some $100 models
the sound is clear , with the right balance of bass and treble
a lot of headphones do not have enough bass , or if they do , the overall sound is muffled
these find the right balance , and sound great for music or movies
and at this price , i doubt you could beat it .
synposis : good sound quality , relatively comfortable , and can be registered for a lifetime warranty with koss
not much else that can be asked for from a set of headphones at this prices range
the sound quality and comfort are both fairly exceptional , although it should be noted that they let a lot of sound leak both in and out courtesy of their design
on the other hand for a traveling headphone of light build , that isn not always a problem
the lifetime warranty should be noted as well
i had to use it once because one of the sides went dead , but they replaced the set and i am back to enjoying them .
i have recently realized that i am what some like to refer as an "audiophile
" i have always loved good sound reproduction , excellent sound range as well as quality
when i was younger , i used to buy koss pretty much exclusively
lately though , i have been somewhat disappointed though with a few exceptions , the koss portapro being at the top of the list ! these headphones have been around since i was a teenager and unlike me , they are still going strong ! they have fantastic sound , they are not overly affected in the bass range ( they don not add extra bass for the "boom boom" window rattlers out there ) , they are economical , comfortable and just all around a fantastic buy
also , they are recommended by serious audiophiles as the best portable out there
i can not agree with that entirely ; i also recommend the sennheiser and depending on your needs
but of the three , these are the least expensive but offer fantastic sound that you would expect to come out of a pair of full size cans ( headphones , i guess i am learning the audiophile lingo ! )
the koss portapro have the comfort zone temple pads that help make them even more comfortable and the pressure between temple and ear can be adjusted literally by the flick of a switch on ear side of your head
i have a massive head and these fit me with room to spare
i like the firmest setting on the comfort zone but i have tried the other two settings as well and i can honestly say that there is a difference ; it is not just a gimmick
the comfort zone really works
these are truly portable also ! they fold up into a little ball that can then be placed into a convenient case that koss provides
i personally would recommend buying a shell case that koss also sells just for the extra protection
what more can i say ? if you'd like a few other recommendations in the truly portable range , the sennheiser and are rugged , comfortable and highly portable
( they collapse as well and fit into their own plastic case
) if you like earbuds , the sennheiser is wonderful with its volume control ; the sound is absolutely amazing for something so small
and finally , the koss ktxpro1 is an excellent portable headphone with an volume control
it uses a titanium element to drive it
all of these are great products but ultimately this particular review is about the koss portapro and i really am blown away at how great these tiny portable cans truly are
i believe you will be too
though i have become somewhat disillusioned by koss as i have become a "audiophile" ( why not just call me someone who really loves good sound to come through good instead of creating a term that sets me apart from everyone else ? ) , i highly recommend these cans to you
if you are on a budget , you especially can not go wrong
remember that koss guarantees all their cans for life with their "no questions asked" guarantee
it is worth it ! so as my review title states , "the koss portapro shines in every area
"oh , one last thing : don not listen to people who say these cans are ugly or clunky ; they aren not
the design is what gives the portapro its unique sound quality and i personally think they look cool ! ultimately though , it is the sound that matters , right ? : )
not a bad pair of headphones at all
excellent sound quality all across the spectrum except it leaves something to be desired for on the low end of the frequency spectrum
once you get below 60hz it really begins to taper off quickly the further down you go in freq
it is defintely high quality bass sound , not muddy , just soft
extremely comfortable ! i just expected these to have better bass response than they did .
i have both the koss protapro and sennheiser px100 headphones
i love them both ! i just bought the portapros brand new
my px100 is <NUM> years old and the mechanicals are wearing out
here is a comparison between the two
the mechanicals on the px100 are a notch better than the portapros
the px100 has headband padding ; the portapros do not and take a few hairs out now and then
once placed on your head , both are comfortable
the px100 folds up neater than the portapros
the px100 design is sleeker , more modern and less prominent on your head
the over all construction seems a notch better on the px100
here is the interesting thing though
both are open air but the portapros seem to seal out external sounds a little better than the px100
i cannot explain why
the portapros are also slightly more efficient and play a bit louder
the sound character of each is a matter of taste
both headphones sound excellent
both are sweet , clean and very detailed
both are
the protapros are a bit bass heavy
on some music that bassy sound is magnificent
on other types of music with already prominent bass the px100 is preferable
surprisingly , the high frequencies are equally well extended on both headphones
the portapros are a little sweeter in the high frequencies than the px100
the px100 may be a little more accurate with a slightly better midrange than the portapros
the px100 is an modern design
the portapros are classics with a design that goes back <NUM> years ! the original px100 came with a nice case
the portapros have a hook and eyelet at the bottom of the metal headband
they hook together to bind them tight to fit inside a small bag
i use neither the bag nor the case
you may want to buy both
you can not go wrong with either .
these are simply awesome
i am not an audiophile by any means , but i do have a few pairs of expensive and sophisticated earphones with so and so and this and that
they are great and have their uses , but if all you need is a pair of earphones that you can carry in your jacket pocket or laptop bag , you won not find a serious competitor to the portapros
they are compact , sturdy , and of reasonable quality
will you get the same quality as a pro set of headphones ? of course not , but you likely don not need high fidelity if you are on the metro , studying , watching youtube , or perusing your podcasts
if you need a pair of nifty , retro , collapsible , and decent quality headphones , pick these up
note that the phones themselves are about the size of an average ear
they will not cover your entire ear .
i have owned a pair of porta pro is since 1988
i have used the koss lifetime warranty several times in that period , and every time it is been just fine
on one pair i had even soldered on my own replacement plug , and i called koss to make sure they would still be covered
the man on the phone said , "you could chop them up into a million pieces and mail the pieces to us in a bag , and we'd still send you a replacement set
" now that is customer service ! sound quality : you will not find anything in this price range that even comes close
the bass is deeper than you would expect for such a small device , and the highs are clear
the sound is not fatiguing at all
i listen to them at the office every day for up to <NUM> hours and they are brilliant
comfort : since they are design , they don not make your head sweat
the metal band can snag your hair occasionally but it is not a major problem
looks : 80 is tastic
i think that is a plus , your mileage may vary
value for money : unbeatable .
see title
both my wife and i love these , they fit nice , very nice price , look reasonably durable , and the sound range is everything i can hear
what is not to like ?
i am a headphone nut
i have invested thousands in headphones , dacs , and dedicated amplifiers and i consider myself to be pretty picky
you can trust that i would give a negative review if it was warranted
for the money , you would be hard pressed to find any headphone that sounds better
good bass without being overstated , highs are clear with good extension , and isn not harsh ( my biggest complaint with headphones under the $200 mark )
these have a similar sound signature to my beloved sennheiser px100 is ( not the px100 ii ( two is ) that have replaced that discontinued model ) at a similar price point
for anyone looking for good quality sound on a budget , you can not beat these
trust me , i have tried them all ! don not expect much in the way of isolation ( blocking outside noise from coming in , or keeping your sounds from coming out ) with these , and the sound quality is much more apparent in quiet environments
these don not really need an amplifier for normal listening , but i do find that they require a little more power than my zune will put out if i am on an airplane or train
i'd buy these again if lost or stolen .
this is my favorite headset to use around the house
pros : light weight , collapsible , adjustable band , good sound , comfortable to wear
( i get tired of using my phones )
it is not noise isolating but i like being able to hear my surroundings .
sound effect is good , but i see more negative pt about this product than it is basic feature of good sounds and bass
1 ) the cover spoilt rather easily , iucky , i have bought the replacement pack together2 ) the metal headband and the plastic catch comes off easily , i have to carefully remove from my head as if you had bend it more when removing from your head , the plastic catch will be loose and the headset will be separated into 2
i have to &<HASHTAG> ; repair&<HASHTAG> ; it a few times
now i am extra careful when removing from my head
3 ) the cable is way too short ! only about 0
5m i think
i am using in on my pc
lucky i have front speaker jack
definately will not be able to fit the back panel speaker jack .
really nice pair of low cost ear phones that do a very decent job
if youu do'nt want to spend a lot of money you get your monies worth with this set .
excellent sound reproduction
cord just the right length so that i can put my minidisc player in my pocket
just one thing that keeps me from giving them <NUM> starts
every time i take them off the metal bands slide so that i have to readjust them every time i put them on again
a set of headphones like these that stayed the way i set them would get <NUM> stars
added in edit : amazon lets you edit your reviews , but not your
i am not changing a word of the text , but having to adjust the headband is proving to be an annoyance
lower my star ranking to 3
from what i gather , there are lots of good headphones out there
i wouldn not buy another pair of these .
i have owned a lot of low to mid range headphones in my lifetime
currently , i have a pair of skullcandy earbuds , a pair of the stock ipod earbuds and a pair of $35 sony studio headphones ( the big ones )
they were not working for me
the sound on the sony ones were pretty decent , but prolonged use made my ears ache and could get very warm in the wrong climate ( like
summer )
they were also very heavy , so reading text books or just reading my kindle , these things would not cut it as it would also put strain on my neck
my ears were just not made for earbuds , as i had various problems with those
the ipod earbuds failed miserably , as the sound was always too shallow for me and they kept falling out of my ears
so , i looked for the most rated headphones ( not earbuds ) with over a <NUM> star rating on amazon and stumbled across these
over a <NUM> reviews and it still had <NUM> 1/2 stars ? yeah , i will take some time to check these out lol
so i got them a week ago
to avoid any "premature" reviewing , i let them sit the first three days with music on constantly , racking up about hours of "break in" time before i tried them out objectively
first the headphones themselves
they are very , very light
the head band are a couple of thin metal bands with plastic pieces that adjust size
i like this because metal is durable but it is also light and airy and doesn not make me feel like i am wearing a music factory on my head
the ear pads are more comfortable than i imagined
they are not dollar store ear pads ( although they look that way ) and are comfortable on the ears
a wildly awesome thing about these phones that people often overlook are all the parts that make them comfortable
the ear pieces themselves are hinged , so they bend depending on the shape of your ear
the metal bands are firm but flexible so it doesn not press too hard on the head or ears
then there is comfortzone settings
it took a minute to figure out how the settings work , but once i did i was treated to a unique comfort experience
comfortzone consists of two pads on either side that rest on the temples
the firmer the settings , the more pressure on your temples and less on your ears
i found this awesome as i could sit with these headphones on my head for <NUM> straight hours and feel no ear fatigue at all
now for the part everyone wants to read : the sound
i am not an audiophile and i won not use any technical terms
the music sounded just plain great
i can hear bass lines in rock songs , and rap songs thump ( but not uncomfortably so )
the music sounds whole and complete and not shallow and airy like ipod headphones do
the high notes sound good and even at high volumes don not cackle or distort and in no song that i listened to did anything sound muddy or wrong
the volume is well balanced
maxed out is too loud and that is something my other pairs of headphones can not say
i have often had to max out settings just to get a decent volume on my sony headphones
these i can keep in the middle volume range and it still sounds good
they are not noise cancelling and they leak sound
i am okay with this because when i jog , i'd like to hear the cars coming before they hit me ; ) so if you are looking for noise cancelling and quiet for others , then you should probably keep searching
all in all , for the price , i can not imagine having gotten a better pair of headphones
personally , i love the retro style of the headphones
keep in mind that chucks have fallen in and out of style for <NUM> years and they are top sellers
this has been in and out of style for nearly <NUM> years and it is a top seller
i put them in the same category ( and , as it happens , own both now ) which is "totally awesome"
if you are looking for some lightweight phones that sound great and have a unique look , then your search is over
i wish i'd found these <NUM> years ago when i started using headphones for the first time .
my first portapros came with a koss fm radio i bought in the
they never wore out , outlasting the radio by more than a decade , and i eventually misplaced them
i was thrilled to discover they are still available after all these years
they are comfortable and durable , and they sound great
lifetime warranty , too
very few products these days avoid obsolescence for a quarter century
the koss portapros are tried and true , and still relevant
imagine that .
awesome little headphones , some of the best sounding set i have ever owned
they are a little rough to look at , but i am very glad i gave them a try
these sound terrific , and adjust for your ears with lighter pressure , if you so desire
the only drawback i would see for these has to do with their higher impedance , at <NUM> ohms , as opposed to a lower impedance for most portables out there
the higher impedance means that batteries would empty quicker when used with mobile gear , but well worth the money for the sound
amazing product , i will buy a second pair as a .
i bought these on the recommendation of cnet and i wasn not disappointed
they sound great , and they fold well for easy carrying
for a ( please note that before any other comments ) i didn not hear much difference between several other more expensive sets
they have a rich sound and i have yet to listen to anything they don not play well
however there is one huge thing that isn not stressed enough here although i did see it mentioned before i purchased mine
i bought mine to study with and no one will study with me anymore due to the leakage
these leak a lot
my wife can hear me listening to lectures and my study partners can hear my music three seats down
they are great but should not be purchased to listen to in a library
the hair pulling happens occasionally , but you get past that by putting them on carefully and it isn not a huge hassle
a little hard for me to get in the carry case also
i am purchasing another set for study , but let me be clear , i am keeping these for all other uses
i just want to make sure you don not buy these for quiet surroundings .
*update 9/8/10* these headphones are great but they do have one potentially serious design flaw
the stereo connector is very flimsy
despite being very careful , mine broke in under a year
the stereo connector literally just pulled apart as i was removing it from the ipod one day
the wires pulled right out of the connector
after checking the web , i see i am not the only one to experience this
someone was even kind enough to post a picture of it above , in the product photos
i still think they are great headphones and i ordered a new pair ( although i plan to have these replaced under warranty and keep as a spare )
i knocked off one star simply because now i have to shell out $6 plus shipping to replace this set ( although i opted to pay $30 for a new pair to save time )
however , if the second pair breaks as quickly as the first , prepare to watch the review stars plummet
what good is something if it won not last at least a year ? * end of update *i have tried pretty much all types of headphones
i was looking for a good solid pair , under $50 , preferably but not too big ( for gym , athletic use and better portability )
i stumbled across these on the web and saw that people loved them , so i came to amazon to read some reviews
seeing that they were highly rated here as well , i ordered a pair
these headphones have a solid reputation for a reason , they sound great
the minute i plugged them in , i knew why they were so highly rated
clear highs , deep lows
i mean , it is not bone rattling bass , but it is decent enough if you don not want to lug around a pair of $50+ heavy headphones
easily the best sounding headphones i have bought the past year
and that is in a group of skull candy , sony , apple , self powered , noise canceling
i have tried it all the past year
the only ( extremely minor ) gripe i have is that i agree with others that it does feel flimsy at times
i like that the moving pieces are metal instead of plastic ( can not tell you how many plastic headphones i have inadvertently broken from simply putting on and removing ) , but it still has a somewhat delicate feel to it
they do come with a lifetime warranty , which is pretty sweet , ( although a further check of the terms reveal you pay to ship them back and have to include a $6 check
something potential purchasers should be aware of )
i am happy with my set and agree with everyone else that these headphones come in a portable package but possess sound .
i shopped alot before i decided on these headphones i read all the reviews here as well as on many other sites
to tell you the truth i found the hype hard to believe for a product that has remained unchanged since the 80 is
i rated these babies a <NUM> star for the sound quality and price it helps if you have a headphone amp if your using small devices to run them like ipod but not mandatory they get pretty loud without my amp and probably would protect your hearing better without it
i can tell and improvement with the amp but it sounds really good just plugged straight into the ipod
i really like these over my vmoda bass earplugs for certain activities like exercise the bass buds sound better on alot of things without the amp especially but if you walk or ride with the buds in your hear the wire rubbing your clothes it amps up your breathing etc
plus if your walking like i do where people bike or drive you cant hear them coming up behind you , not a problem with the porta pros on
i have to point out that you can hear them if your sitting or standing next to someone wearing them so if your listening to somethiing loud and dont want to disturb others around you they dont work well for that like on a plane , bus , in a car so there are some limitations to it
people made alot of issue with the retro style either for or against
in all honesty they really dont look all that odd on your head and are quite comfy the fact that they fold up to carry in the bag is nice but they are still bulkier than a pair of ear buds
alot of people reviewd them as being studio quality monitor headphones this to me seems a bit much but they are definately on par with any headphones i tried while looking for a new set
i even felt they rivaled the bose over ear set although the noise cancelation you get from the cup does make the bose sound better on some stuff
i would say you cant go wrong with this headphone set especially for small devices like ipods and the like .
i used the sennheiser headphones ( very similar in size , price , and style ) almost daily for <NUM> years when one side crapped out
so i bought the koss portapro is as a replacement
the koss are not as attractive
not that important to me
the koss are not as comfortable
the metal head band is cheesy , when compared to the sennheiser is , and they are only $10 more
the koss are also a tad too tight
my ears burned ( even when on the loosest setting ) after about <NUM> hours
the big problem , and i toyed around with equalizer settings in winamp ( my mp3 player software of choice ) , is that the koss are incredibly easy to overdrive , even at relatively low listening levels
not so the sennheiser headphones
had i noticed distortion with them , i would have chucked them long ago
summary : if you want a light pair of , portable headphones , spend the extra $$ and get the sennheiser ( or higher models )
the koss may be adequate for portable mp3 devices where you cannot adjust the eq settings , but for more ambitious use , they are far too inadequate
i am buying another pair of the sennheiser is .
the build quality seems cheap and all but the sound quality is pretty good
the little pouch that came with it seems nice .
punchline : i have looked around and can not think of any headphones with a $35 price point which would sound better than koss portapro is
fyi , there is a newer model which has a remote on its cable and supports ios devices
i remember drooling over these way back in the day when one of my favorite european magazines used to use these as a reference for all portable headphones
they deserved it
and although the crown had been taken off these by better headphones as the time went by , portapro is have still lot to offer and easily beat other competitors twice the price of these or more
i would not hesitate for a second to put portapro is above dr
dre is beats ( which are an over priced , mediocre sounding ) phenomenon these days
design : portapro is draw attention of onlookers as their signature design does look somewhat nerdy
: - ) fit is great , the temporal pads can adjust their pressure , hence alleviating the pressure put on your ears the bridge is consisting of two pieces sliding on top of each other , though , the plastic sleeves on top of the bridge can push into the top of your head and if you have less hair , you may feel it after awhile
also , if you have long hair , or lots of it ( not my problem ) , your hair could get snagged between the bridge pieces and get pulled
cable is , has a <NUM> degree angled 3
5mm jack and splits to go into each side of the headphones
it is not replaceable , so if it breaks , you need new cans
koss honors limited lifetime warranty , if you register
sound : they sound as good as my akg q460 , maybe with a touch more bottom end and a bit more of treble
due to their construction , they do not isolate outside noise as well , so using listening to your tunes on the train or in the city with lots of ambient noise will make you crank the volume up
beware , their bass is powerful , so treat your ear drums with some care
listening to portpro is at home or during a stroll in a park or quiet neighborhood is a joy
treble , mids and bass are in a great balance , so these cans do not require much tinkering with eq
i actually use the "flat" equalizer setting on my ipod
impedance is <NUM> ohm , so you need to turn up the volume a notch or two when switching from a pair of standard <NUM> ohm headphones to make portapro is sound at the same level of loudness
i bought them at which was closing and they had them marked for $32
i will eventually buy the of replacement foam ear pads
included is a nice little faux leather pouch and can fold and fit into it very nicely , so good news for road warriors .
i have tried out a number of portable headphones and these are the best i have found so far
this is the second pair i have purchased since i liked the first set so well , and wanted another for my laptop bag
pros : good sound quality , lightweight , comfortable , fold up easily into a carry bag so it is portable
the folded set fits very nicely into limited laptop storage compartments
cons : kinda flimsy feel , although i have had the first pair for over a year with no problems
they also look a bit dorky but , eh , whatever
overall i think this is a nice choice for the price
update : i had the wire to the right phone short out after just over <NUM> year
this pair doesn not get folded that often ( and these are foldable , travel type phones ) , so i don not think that reflects well on the unit
i have downgraded to <NUM> stars based on this issue .
decent , clean sound
the offset design has advantages and disadvantages
they fold up all right , but seem to spring back to a width so you can adjust and leave them in one position
not disappointed and the price is pretty good .
with all of the hype related to these headphones , i was expecting to be let down in some way at the very least
however , after many months of use at the office , i have come to believe that these headphones are really something special
it is hard to imagine getting such a full sound out of such an inexpensive/lightweight product
they are easily driven by an ipod or smartphone , but they really shine when plugged into my laptops ( with beats audio and without )
solid , but tight bass , rich mids , and shiny highs help these headphones breathe new life into the songs that you have been listening to for years
do yourself a favor and stop thinking about it and just get yourself a pair
you won not regret it .
i had a pair of these ( best buy edition with cable & updated styling , not anniversary ) years ago
those were misplaced , but i remembered them fondly
i switched to bluetooth models for awhile ( motorola ) and those were great , but i forgot how much was sacrificed by the switch
had to buy new ones after my motorolas were stolen , so i came back to the cord , a little reluctantly since i use them actively
glad i went back
the clarity is fantastic
, i do have to toggle the firmness down to light every time i put them on ( and that is somewhat annoying ) but the convenience of rolling them up eclipses that
the cord is on the shorter end at four feet , which i appreciate- i have never seen the need for long cords on headphones
if i need to use them at a desktop or something i will grab an extender
the pouch is gimmicky and a touch small , but serves the purpose- i will probably put them in something else
the headband can catch longer hair , but i wear a buzz , so that is not a problem
they are even more comfortable than similar models while laying down to sleep
some people complain about the style , but i have always loved it
they are easier to wear underneath a knit hat , or in conjunction with sunglasses
the design is eternal for a reason
you really can not do better at sub-$100
if your hair is longer , wrap electrical tape around the band- it won not collapse anymore , but you won not rip your hair out
if the stock pads don not satisfy , get some grado bowl replacements ( but the stock pads are fine
) if they break , send them into koss for a replacement , $6 s&h
; the new model has an angled plug- not , but not straight either , which i find convenient for preventing but might not work with some cases
a testament to how good these headphones are- my very picky grandfather has gone through several different models of headphones
after he tried my new set on once , i had to order another pair the next day .
hands down the best sounding headphones i have ever purchased
they really should be broken in for optimum sound though ; hook them up to an audio source and let it play through them for about <NUM> hours
after breaking in they will sound amazing
i have read quite a few reviews about how some $10 pair of headphones sounds just as good/better and i can tell you that it is crap
some people can not tell the difference between bass and quality
if all you want it bass with no fidelity you will be sadly mistaken but if you want bright , clear sound with a good range and great clarity , these are awesome for the money .
looking for portable headphones , i first went with thesennheiser px <NUM> lightweight collapsible headphones , because i have been using sennheisers for years ( the hd 580s for about <NUM> years before they finally died , and thesennheiser stereo headphone ( old version ) for the couple of years they lasted ) , and figured i'd try their portable headphones
as i wrote in my review of the ( <URL> i found them uncomfortable , and lacking in bass
these portapros fix both those problems : i can wear them for many hours consecutively before my ear cartilage gets a bit sore , but this is a big improvement over the sennheiser px 100s , which started hurting after only about an hour
bass is good enough , though perhaps lacking slightly compared to headphones
but , for $40 these offer a great in sound quality
the only negatives are the retro look ( if that bothers you - i don not mind it at all ) , and if you have long hair ( i don not ) , the metal band tends to catch your hair and pull out a few strands ; i know when this starts happening to me , it is time for a haircut : )
pros : compact , light weight , lifetime warranty , great sound for size/price
moving around much ? they have a tight grip on your head
durable , i once stepped on them causing one of the ear pieces to pop off and i simply clicked it back into place like nothing happened
short cord for people who don not wander <NUM> feet away from their audio player ( laptop , mp3 player ) like some other headphones have
cons : i have heard people say how comfy they are , but my hat size of <NUM> 1/2 says very different
after a few hours they simply prove to tight and give me a headache
and that is whether i have sound running through them or not
on occasion a hair might get caught in the metal band but not enough of a problem to warrant not getting them
i use these for my laptop and ipod and they do an excellent job with music and gaming
base is kinda bad but for the size and cost it does more then enough
mine have the straight plug which is really annoying as i like the <NUM> deg ones much better but it works regardless
i'd recommend these to other people
the only drawback i can find is they can give me a headache of using them for a couple hours
maybe if you have a smaller head you will be ok ? they can seem flimsy , but i have had them for <NUM> years and have traveled with them so i couldn not justify and claims of them being "cheap" headphones
and with a lifetime warranty i say go to town
i don not use the case at all either , used to , but i deemed it to much of a hassle and lost it somewhere
no regrets on that
i would give the product <NUM> stars but the headache thing really detracts from them
i still like and use my pair and if you want some cheap good headphones i'd go with these again any day of the week
( maybe not tuesday )
this is a decent headphone it works without issue and the wires seem to be thick enough not to bend and break leaving only <NUM> side working
however since i wear glasses they seem to be a little tight for extended use however if you can remove them for awhile every couple of hours then i would definetly recomend these especially at less than $50
we have two pair for now over a year and they are well made and easy to store away in a purse-
i have had the koss portapro is for about four months now and i decided it was time to give them the review they deserved
i mainly used standard sony studio monitor headphones for personal music listening when i am on my desktop computer or laptop , and i would use earbuds with my ipod on the go or in bed at night
i decided i wanted to try these headphones considering the golden reviews they have been getting
when i received them they were a lot smaller than i thought they would be , but they fit my head perfectly and they are very comfortable
i can not even feel them after a while
they do require a little adjusting after some time but my ears don not feel sore after long listening sessions
they sound great and they look great , too
some people might think they look too wild/retro/geeky , but that is what i like about them -- they are unique in their design
they don not look bad to me at all
they have an extremely clean and crystal clear sound
the highs are crisp , the mids are warm , full , and natural , and the lows are tight , deep , and
they do have a little bit of extra bass , but that is no problem for me
i can just turn off the eq on my computer audio player and they sound perfect
i always have the eq off on my ipod so they sound just fine there , too
the extra bass really isn not that bad at all
it shouldn not affect your buying choice with these headphones
yes , they are flimsy and you have to be somewhat gentle with them , but they are surprisingly durable
i have fallen asleep at night with these headphones on and when i wake up finding them near my pillow off my head , i am worried they had been destroyed
to my surprise , i find no bends or any signs of stress on them
the ear pieces don not even fall off either , and those are held on with just a little plastic clip it looks like
( they pivot to fit the shape and position of your ears
) the only cons i have about these headphones is the somewhat short cable length
it is 4ft
long , but i sometimes find myself accidently yanking on them with my arms when i am not careful
that is fine though , as i just use another 4ft
extension cable i found
i also have to adjust the headband to almost it is widest when i put them on
i wish there was some type of locking mechanism on the headband
these have become my standard headphones for and listening
overall , these are great headphones and i will definitely choose these for the rest of my life , or until they stop making them .
this koss model received overall very good reviews
i can understand why , they sound full , open and music sounds great
also comfortable , although i have not worn them for an extended time
i would recommend if one uses them hooked up to a cell phone make sure the mike is relatively close to your mouth
others may have a difficult time hearing you
very please !
why does a cheap set of headphones with weird plastic and a metal band that catches in your hair get so many five star reviews ? because they sound amazing
nothing in this price range even comes close
most people compare these with the sennheiser px100 ii
well , i have both and they are both excellent headphones , and the sennheisers are much better quality , but the sound of the portapros is much better
i am on my second pair , and will buy another when this set breaks .
these phones sound great for the price
i have owned <NUM> of them and the plug will short out in <NUM> months or less if you use them often
i have purchased <NUM> because i see them as disposable toy junk
i have not found a better sounding phone for <NUM> dollars so i see it as <NUM> dollar per year deal
i have grado 60s and sennheiser is hd <NUM> pros , for <NUM> years with no problems , but they are bulky and heavy for travel and exercise
i have owned sennheiser is 100s and 200s and they sound as good but no better , and they cost <NUM> times more and the last <NUM> months or less as well or snap like a rotten twig
i may buy the koss pros again and tape the plug area to reduce the stress , but i know that <NUM> months or so they will end up in the trash
buy them , but no one i know has had a pair last longer than a year with light use
if they are lost or stolen you will not feel bad as the person who steals of finds them will get the honor to throw them away
it is a shame , but koss has destroyed their once good name because their quality has been lost and i wonder how they can compete with other companies who make phone with fashion and style and the durability to stand the stress from younger folks who wear phones for hours everyday
i guess a week tops and they will short out .
i have this for <NUM> years now and i still use it for my everyday use
it is strong and sounds great better than a lot of my more expensive headphones
too bad people care more about aesthetics then the actual quality if things anymore .
i purchased these headphones to replace my sennheisers px100
for several months i was happy
the sound quality is right up there with the px100
however , i use headphones pretty much everyday for running , exercising , walking , etc
i need them to last and take a beating
i am constantly pulling on the cord by accident or even dropping my mp3 player detaching it from the plug
now after maybe <NUM> months of use i have lost sound in the right ear
it sometimes drops in and out but this is mainly due to the cable being loose inside the earpiece
it is pretty much unrepairable
the sennheisers also cut out in this same manner but they lasted <NUM> years
i guess one way you can look at it is that you can buy <NUM> of these for the price of <NUM> px100
i am not sure if i will try to buy these again yet
it seems that the part where the cable enters the headphone is the weak link in a lot of portable headphones
or maybe i am just too rough with them .
bought four sets of these phones for $25 apiece on the amazon website
this price is 1/2 of the msrp ! i have owned for nearly <NUM> years
just recently , i had the chance to compare them with super high end 'phones costing $350 and $1350 ( ! )
both were over the ear models
while these pricey 'phones delivered superb sound , the difference from the koss 'phones , in my opinion did not justify spending <NUM> to <NUM> times as much money ! more importantly , the over the ear models proved extremely uncomfortable , in my case producing jaw pain after a relatively short period on my head , and so severe that i had to reach for the bottle of motrin
by contrast , the koss 'phones , with adjustable ear pressure , are supremely comfortable
i can wear them for hours without any problems
finally , koss stands by their lifetime guarantee- no questions asked , even if you mistakenly sit on them
in summary , you absolutely will love this headphone
even the stereophile gurus acknowledge the incredible price/performance ratio of this stellar product
unconditionally recommended !
i bought them through a relative is recommendation
they sound great with classical and vocals , but the isolation is nonexistant so they are not the best options if you want to listen on a bus .
it is true , when i am on the go , these are what i take with me
they leak sound , but what does it matter when you are smashin' a dj set ? bestow these on your head , and you might look like something from tron
so work it , because these have a very clear sound
the bass isn not amped , but you don not want it to be if you are producing music
for what it is , plus the lifetime warranty ( $6 for shipping ) - i have suggest these to many a person
- it is been over a year of heavy use , and even losing them once in a moshpit , only to later find them sweaty , but unharmed ! these things can take a hit , and the bass is still better than i thought it would be .
i had mine sent back and i think it was <NUM> dollars ( like a year ago ) + shipping
and i felt like i got a brand new one back in the mail
they even replaced the cushions
the sound quality of this headphone is very very good
lets just say that it has its own style
i can say for sure , that
highs are clear , and the base is on the heavy side , and it has just enough surround sound
but the sound quality of these headphones are so unique that you just have to try them out for yourself
if you are an audiophile , you got to have one of these just because it is worth having it .
i was a long time loyalist to the sennheiser px <NUM> headphones
i went through two pairs in a few years but was absolutely bummed when i heard that they were no longer producing them
instead , they improved on the design but i didn not want to spend the extra money and the reviews weren not as promising as the original models
instead , i looked around and settled on the portapros
the sound is awesome , the storage is very good ( not as great as the px100 is ) , they are very durable , the cord length is perfect , and the <NUM> throwback design is just a bonus
once i wear down my current pair that i am using right now , i will definitely have to buy another .
the koss portapro headphones work for me as earbuds don not stay in place
i use them while on the treadmill and they stay in place and provide good sound quality
so far i haven not experienced any problems , i have had them over a month .
i purchased these headphones for a recent overseas trip
i used these headphones on the flight to and back from europe and they proved to be excellent for both music as well as movies
if you can live with the design , these headphones are hard to beat for a reasonable price .
i was skeptical that these would provide such a good sound , but they really do sound as good or better than high end headphones .
porta pros have been around for decades in various models and there is a reason they have been so successful
it is because they sound so good ! i have had several versions of these since the late 70s , and never been disappointed
get some , you will be glad you did .
this is an excellent product for the money
first time i tried them on it was unbelieveable how well they sounded
even the low end is pretty good for such a lightweight headphone
previously i had a set of altec lansing uhp304 headphones which i paid well over $80
they sounded very good , but after less than a year of use a short developed in the cable and one side kept cutting out
i returned to altec lansing and never heard anything from them
no more altec lansing
these koss headphones at less than half the price and equal sound quality , and with a lifetime limited warranty can not be beat
had them for over a year and still sound great
the sensitivity is also excellent which means i do not have to turn up the volume as much as with some of the cheaper headphones
a quick note about koss , i had a set of pro 4aaa ( i think ) headphones that i bought in the early 1980 is
i started having problems with them
i wrote a letter to koss and sent it with the headphones to them and in a few weeks i had my headphones back repaired and working perfectly
and this was around 2003
still have the headphones , even bought an upgrade version of them
good company , good product .
i have owned these for two years now , and use them almost every day
they are light , comfortable , and easy to carry in my bag
i have recommended them to several family members who are also delighted with them
the sound quality if very good for the price , and in fact , better than some that cost two or three times as much - as i have discovered to my regret ! i highly recommend these .
i just got these in the mail today
i wanted something cheap with decent quality
the sound quality from these headphones is amazing
i can not attest to the durability of them since i just got them , but wow , the sound is crystal clear with great highs and lows and no distortion
they are kind of dorky looking though .
it is absurd that these are so cheap
they sound basically as good as pro studio headphones
totally effortless , full range of sound that is completely clear
and since they are open , you can still hear things around you , so you don not walk around with that "living in a cloud , disconnected from the world" feeling
also they are totally comfortable
cannot go wrong with these .
very good headphones , especially for the cost
the sound is not really accurate , its more muddled in the mids and lows
but for some reason , this just makes them sound awesome , like some vintage amp playing an old school record
i definitely recommend these .
i can not improve on what is already been said about these phones
sound as good as my grado sr60 at about half the size and cost
seem to be very well constructed but i have only had them a few days
stayed in place on my head through a sweaty jog this morning
first time i have had my tunes along on a jog and i highly recommend it
i run on a busy highway so i wanted to be able to hear outside noises for safety
i could hear the traffic and the music
with no outside noise , the music is just incredible
i use 320kbps mp3 mostly and , although i have a pretty good pc stereo setup ( , kenwood , bose ) , i heard not only new musical nuances but words which i had not previously recognized
i don not pretend to be an audiophile and my hearing has gone downhill but i have been into music a long time
we are into sacd , with klipsch and polk speakers so i think i have heard some pretty good music
i was still impressed with the clarity and fidelity of these little phones
oh , i have tried them with both my pc stereo setup and through a sansa clip player
both sound terrific
they don not look as hip as the little buds but they don not look totally dork either
cable is plenty long enough for me
now , i did hear a slight click with each jogging step which i think is just the wire slapping the phones or movement of the ear cup itself
it may begin to bother me and if so i will try to eliminate it but today it just helped me maintain a steady pace and didn not detract from the music at all
i think most people will really like these phones
i definitely do .
i find them comfortable enough
they are also small and light
they do sound fine to me , but i am not a great judge of that anymore
however , there is one annoying thing , the short cord
i am sure that is all in the eyes of the beholder , but that is how i feel .
i needed a set of headphones that was small enough to take with me wherever i go
these deliver surprisingly punchy trebels and mids
the bass could be stronger , but is not at all shabby for other headphones in this price range
love the retro look
the foldability makes them ideal for my laptop bag and workout bag .
i agree with all the positive reviews about these amazing stereophones
they sound phenomenal for the price
the only negative is the weakness of the cords
after a year or two of normal use , one side or the other may break its connection and there is no way you can fix it yourself ( many tiny strands to solder )
i have returned mine twice to koss ( great lifetime warranty ) and they have replaced them for a small $6 shipping charge
it takes about weeks
that is my only complaint .
these headphones are not only great for listening to music
but i bought them for playing electric guitar , piano , and violin thru them for prartice
the extra ohm "60" makes the diff over the <NUM> ohm ones on the market
i didn not want the big bulky studio ones that feel like you are wearing football helmet after a hour
these are feather lite and really can not even tell they are on your head
you line <NUM> pod users or other multi effect users , well lover these
the extra ohm does make a diff in tone
no ice picking or high shrill
rich bass and tone through out
very pleased with them
as well as the tone for mp3 is
very rich tone all the way around
at <NUM> ohm you won not notice that much of a diff for mp3 is
but for playing musical instruments thru them , the extra ohm makes a big diff in tone
well be using these with my line <NUM> pocketpod and guitar on the shady back porch all summer long
they are not like my marshall stack , but they excellent
i know my neighbors well love em .
these are great sounding headphones ! they are little hard sometimes to resize for your head but the sound is stellar for the price .
 <NUM> years
<NUM> years and counting
this is how long since the koss portapro was introduced , and to this day , they still roll off the production line virtually unchanged since 1984
talk about market endurance and lasting appeal
this headphone model trudged through and survived the ever evolving portable music industry , from the cassette walkman , to the era of mp3 players and the ipod and now , the streaming era
it is baffling to imagine how one seemingly unassuming product could accomplish such a feat
one probable cause is the quality to price ratio
the portapros have gone up in price over the years , but still , currently at $40 , they still remain a great value in headphones because of their unrivaled sound quality at this price point
koss , for the most part , is known more for their budget headphones but the portapro is one audiophile secret that the masses need to know about
these pump out sound so decent , they compare well enough against headphones way beyond their price range ! in fact , i like their sound signature so much that i use them as my starting reference headphones to analyze other sets
they are the ultimate beginner audiophile headphones
so what is it about these cans that make them so great ? why are they revered by fans all over , sparking a rather vocal cult following ? seeing them for the first time , you might not even dare venture to try them on
they look like light , flimsy , cheap 80 is headsets
( which is in a sense , what they really are
) some may even argue vainly that they are so ugly and hideous , it will be horrifying to be caught dead with them hugging your noggin
( i find them charmingly futuristic in a retro kind of way , though
like how movies in the 80 is imagine what future thingies will look like
) there is a minimalist commitment to these headphones' presentation
see , there is just this mere sliding metal headband on top attached to plastic mounts that support two thin , even more plastic , grilled sound drivers , thinly wired , with black foam padding , terminating into a 3
5 mm <NUM> degree jack
but that same plastic mount gives the portapros their unique iconic look and character
it is called the comfortzone slider and together with the metal accents , it lends the portapros that robocop/terminator aesthetic
it was probably a gimmick back in the day because the comfortzone settings ( light to firm ) hardly do anything for me except point the drivers outward on the light setting , resting the foams on my temples
the portapros , therefore , are known and remembered for this look and koss was smart not to tinker with something that is iconic
and you don not get the portapros for their ruggedness or luxurious build quality
they feel so utilitarian they could be the headphones communists will finally distribute to the proletariat
they feel so delicate and fragile that koss was kind enough to give a lifetime warranty ! so basically , if you buy a portapro now , you are set for life
at the end of the day , you get the portapros because of their sound characteristics
these would never have achieved their legendary status if not for their aural properties
this is why we obsess over headphones anyway
they are not a flash in the pan fad nor are they glossed over by celebrity marketing
these are honest and consumer products endorsed by the same consumers themselves
what you get with the portapros is surprising clarity and detail , you can not believe a budget headphone is actually piping it out
the drivers on these things are awesome for their price and size but they are not perfect , of course
the high end detailing sparkles with this set although treble is somewhat grainy
bass is substantial and not overpowering but , however , could get loose in the higher bass frequencies
this low end bleeds to the the lower mids rendering it with a slight nasality
the proper mid frequencies are forward and present but they lack smoothness
technically , with these faults , you could argue that these shouldn not sound good , but all in all , when you combine these traits , it is actually a pleasurable listening experience
i think , coupled with their specific sound signature , what makes these portable sets shine is their soundstage and separation
since they are technically open back sets , the soundstage is unconstrained by resonance , giving them this feathery , airy feel
instrument separation , as a consequence , is remarkably even and it fleshes detail out
of course , there a lot of expensive high end sets that could do this better , but if you are upgrading from entry level sets near the portapro is price point then the sound difference will be life changing
like i said , these could rival or outperform headphones twice or triple their price
some people compare the portapros to another open back can , the grado prestige series sr80i stereo headphone or thegrado prestige series padded headphones , but nothing could be more different
these grados are excellent and extremely detailed but they skew more towards the bright treble side of things which could sometimes be too harsh for some people
the portapros are tuned more as balanced sets , if not bass focused , what with their slightly forward mids
both these grados and the portapros are brilliant sets , although the sr80i are twice as expensive
i use the portapros , appropriately enough , more for 80 is synth pop , rock and new wave while i prefer the grados for acoustic guitar recordings , and if you must , do get both
so in summary , the iconic portapros are a 20th century wonder for their longevity and enduring appeal
their price to sound quality and their minimalist utilitarianism is probably the main reason why they have such a following
if you dig that retro chic look and you want a quick entry to quality sound without breaking the bank , then get yourself the portapros now !
ok , i went on a headphone buying spree , so i am comparing these portapros to headphones that cost many times as much ( sennheiser hd595 ) , headphones that cost a bit more ( sennheiser px100 ) and my old sony headphones
well , my sonys are history
i never realized how smeary they were--no detail
these koss portapros hold up very well in comparison with any of the phones i mentioned
good detail and the frequency balance is excellent , far preferable to the px100s and even comparable to the expensive phones
very pleasant to listen to
if i had never heard those expensive phones , i would be happy to have these koss portapros as my only phones
what i have learned by comparative listening is what people refer to as "soundstage"
with the koss phones , everything sounds like it is at your ear or between your ears
not unpleasant , and you won not know what you are missing until you hear it for yourself , but the expensive audiophile phones give you a sonic perspective that extends beyond your ears--far more realistic
i know that considering the price differential this may be an unfair comparison , but i just had to point out that you do sometimes get what you paid for
so the bottom line is , i am in love with the sound of my expensive hd595 headphones and at the same time i am very happy to have these koss portapros for portable use
as a bonus , the portapros are even more comfortable than the expensive phones
and , unlike some folks , i wouldn not say they are ugly at all--just different .
everything the the other reviewers said seems to be true
much , much better sound and more comfortable than the &<HASHTAG> ; standard &<HASHTAG> ;
i flew <NUM> hours back to the us from germany , after watching <NUM> movies , they are immensely comfortable
they do catch your hair when removing or adjusting them
very nice sound for an under $30 set of headphones
the lifetime warranty was the final clincher for me .
the koss portapro has a great &<HASHTAG> ; retro&<HASHTAG> ; design because they haven not changed the darn things since they were introduced in the 80s
the reason being that they got it right the first time
the sound quality is great for open design headphones , they are easily adjustable ( both the headband and the firmness with which the ears &<HASHTAG> ; grab&<HASHTAG> ; the head ) , very light , and can be worn for hours at a time without having any issues
they fold down into a relatively convenient size and even come with a travel bag
if mine get damaged , i will buy another pair .
after reading most customer reviews and a few technical reviews on portable headphones the two names with the most positive comments were koss portapro and sennheiser px100 i bought both pairs to do my own comparisons after <NUM> week i submitted a review giving the portapros a definite edge although not a dramatic one after a full month of listening i no longer use the px100 is i hear things on the portapros you don not even notice on the 100 is i would like to amend my original opinion to say the portapros are significantly better and provide a lifetime warranty
these headphones work great
i use them with my ipod touch and my laptop
they are light , extremely comfortable and have excellant sound
tough to beat for the cost , and the koss warrenty is the best
highly recommend .
i have had these headphones for close to ten years and primarily use them when i travel
pros-----great you have them on your head and adjusted they stay therecons-----no volume press so firmly on the side of my head it gets uncomfortable after a while , even using the pressure setting switch on have had them in twice for repair - lost sound on one side ( for no apparent reason - i am not hard on them and don not use them that often , only a few times a year ) -every time i take them off they lose their adjustment really need to come with a better case
mine came with a drawstring pouch that was difficult to insert the phones into ( i lost it when i sent them back for repair the first time )
koss has some hard cases but one of the comments was that the case was way too big - not conducive to travel
overall grade - a for sound , b for comfort , c for sturdiness , the missing volume control and case , and the minor annoyances
overall i am pleased with these ( would not have kept them for ten years otherwise ) but perfect they ain not .
5 starsfor my 200th review , i thought i'd sing the praises of one of the most useful and wonderful things i have ever owned , the portapro
i got these shortly after they came out , as i always longed for bass in my early aiwa walkman ( best of breed back then )
these thangs changed my life ! i still love music deeply , but back in school it was everything to me , my solace and balm and ecstatic release , hours and hours every day
i still wear mine daily while running the dog , walking the dog , and during various activities as well
they have tremendously balanced sound , lots of bass but very open and tight bass , not sloppy
the highs are clean and never harsh , the mids smooth and present
from bach to the beatles to metallica to charlie parker , they deliver musical sound in a pleasingly full sound spectrum , top to bottom
for the money they are a miracle ! they turn any mp3 player into a real sound machine , and blow away any of the phones except for the thousand dollar customs ( go to the headroom online if you want perfect sound
they sell these alongside the best cans in the world , say no more )
they deliver a surprisingly real soundstage and plenty of truly musical detail
add to that two great features
they fold up easily and fit in your pocket ( make sure to get the folding ones , worth the extra few bucks for sure ) , making them a perfect companion to tiny mp3 players ( they are a perfect match with my muvo 2gb player , such sound from such tiny devices ! )
but the best feature of the portapros is the inestimable lifetime guarantee ! and they ain not whistlin' dixie , folks , they mean it
i would know , as i have bought maybe four of these in the last <NUM> years , but i have owned about <NUM> new pairs total ! whenever the cords wear out or pull out of the ear ( can happen , it is only thin rubber and wire , happens now and then when you are mountain climbing etc ) , i send them back to koss with a check ( only gone up one buck in <NUM> years ) and in a week i get a brand new pair
if that ain not taking care of the customer , what is ? so , for coming through on their promises , and for making a truly and very headphone , i give koss total props and praise for this product , one of the best values i have ever encountered as a music uberlover
this and a muvo 2gb player will set you back only a hundred bucks and then give you so much musical pleasure everywhere you go
i have enjoyed my portapros on mountain tops , inside the louvre , prado , moma , etc , by the sea , on ski slopes , on trains in the high alps with views to die for as beethoven is sixth took me to heaven , in the subways and busses of dozens of lands , in front of literally thousands of sunsets from big sur hills to jamaican beaches to mallorcan cliffs to norwegian fjords and so on for years
i can only imagine how gratifying it must be for the spirits of the great composers to know that their music can now be heard in good sound anyplace on the planet
if we have achieved one useful thing as a species in the last thirty years , this is it : great portable sound that turns any post office line , etc from a nightmare into a dream
in fact , now that i think of it , no product i have ever purchased has brought me this many hours of joy , except perhaps some of my guitars
the pros were <NUM> bucks in the and are now only 35 ; with inflation it should be far more
thank you koss for proving that some companies still know what value is
this is a bargain of the highest degree
whoever invented these , i love you ! buy some for a friend ; i have , many many times
and make sure to buy some for yourself ; your life will become a lot sweeter , especially if you know how to let music take you far beyond this mortal coil
my highest recommendation .
read a few of the below reviews and you will get the picture : these are the best portable headphones for ipod use , hands down
they sound incredible , and are best for working out/walking with an ipod
nothing compares
not the ipod ear buds , not $300 isolation headphones that go in your ear ( i wasted big time and money on them )
if you only buy two headphones in your lifetime , but these for your ipod and a pair of grado sr60 is/80 is for home ipod/stereo use
you will be happy you did .
these things have been around forever because they sound great
sure , they look funny but if you are just chillin' at home , do it !
i am not an audiophile by any means , but the portapro headphones are exceptional
the sound is , especially in lieu of the minimal cost of the unit , clear with a more than adequate amount of bass
as a bonus , the comfort level when wearing these headphones is wonderful
bottom line
a funky looking set of headphones that deliver a powerful and enjoyable experience
try them
you will like them !
i bought these along with a similarly priced set of sennheiser headphones about <NUM> months ago
not until i recently purchased a zen micro did i decide to test all my headphones on this mp3 player
needless to say , other than the bose qc2 set , which is essentially in a league of its own , the koss beat out every other set i own
this includes both denon and sony closed systems
i guess the style and seemingly awkward design made me initially think these headphones were a bad purchase
so , they were relegated to the bookshelf until the zen player arrived
i have to say that the goofy looking design is just that
however , the sound quality ( clarity , separation , tonal balance , etc
) is exceptional for an open ear system
nearly every bit as good as the bose except that the ambient noise distracts from the experience at times .
if you are considering buying this headphone , don not hesitate
it is worth your money
i use it for my ipod and my computer
i never thought headphone this price will sound this good
my only dislike is the looks .
i have had these for a few months now and i am very satisfied
great sound quality , very comfortable , and very durable compared to the plethora of plastic dominating the market
so <NUM> stars from me !
i really like these headphones , but as others point out , they are not very durable
my first pair broke after a year -- and i am very careful with my equipment
i only use them at my computer , they don not travel or get abused
they fell off my desk and the right channel is now shot
anyway , the sound was great -- very warm with fantastic bass and accurate highs
they sound nearly as good as my grados , but are much more comfortable to wear for extended periods
but buy two pairs now , or plan on replacing them later
- years later , i am back to say that the two additional pairs i bought are both going strong and they are still the best quality/comfort/price combination in the world
i have more accurate phones that cost $200+ , but for comfort and long listening sessions , these can not be beat
i hope they are never discontinued
the design looks dated and a bit dorky on your head , but once you hear them , you won not care .
i listened to several headphones from $10-$100 and these are the best between them
while i haven not listened to headphones over $100 i believe it would sound better than many of those too ( possibly the best ever )
good clarity with good bass
very good construction too
can adjust to a lighter setting for more comfort
only <NUM> minor issue
if the earpads aren not centered on your ear or if you have big ears then sometimes the edges of the pad can press uncomfortably on your ear ( only felt if you leave them on a while )
probably koss should offer a larger size ( keeping the speaker the same though ) or make the original pads at the edges ( outer radius ) slightly concave away from the ear .
the portapro has very good sound and base , but the temple pads and metal hooks hurt my big ears , so i sent them back to
the seenheiser also sound very good , but not quite as good as the portapros
i do like the because they are very comfortable
easy to use and are very well made and fold up better than the potapros , but im still looking for a better headphone .
best bucks i have ever spend on a portable headphone
glad i didn not go with bose ae2
this sounds just as good , just as comfortable , and 1/5th of the cost
heck , best money i have ever spend on a headphone
also love the design , i can finally hear people talking with me at work now : )
i picked this because of the high ratings these headphones have been getting high ratings for years
the quality of sound reproduction , they do deserve a high rating
if you aren not using them a noisy environment--they have no real passive or active noise blocking
you can not be dissatisfied with the quality of sound reproduction
i was surprised by the light build and somewhat small size of them
they certainly don not make a satisfying thud when you toss them onto a coffee table -- which probably isn not that good of idea anyway
so , this lightness and somewhat small size i can just as easily viewed as a plus as well a minus
i really expected headphones which has been manufactured for decades to come with an rca rather than a modern one
while i find it probably handier to have a modern type plug on the headphones , i really think they should have included a adapter with it
i am not going against the years' of reviews before mine
the sound from these headphone are clear , crisp , and has a fine frequency range
i seriously doubt you are going to find anything better than these headphones when they are on sale
the quality of sound reproduction was what i expected , i was just startled by the small size and heft of them
you might find that a very pleasant surprise .
cnet had these as the and but i found them to be average on my beats audio type touchscreen computer .
i was on the verge of buying bose headphones but the price bothered me
i read at least <NUM> reviews from different sources and decided to buy koss plus my picky sister said they were good
i am pleased , they sound great and the price is right .
i bought these headphones based on the good reviews about the sound quality and the comfort , but i find them to be very uncomfortable
the collapsible band has two plastic pieces which press into the top of my head
there is no way to keep them away from my head without having the headset so loose that it falls off
maybe i just have a small head or not enough hair but i like my sennheiser px100s better
they have a padded band which is very comfortable and i never feel the headset pressing on the top of my head and the sound quality is just as good .
works great if you are not planning on getting sweaty , sounds fine for the money compared to the price of the xtrememac class of ear/headsets on the market .
i don not know how someone could give these anything below three stars
sure , i could understand four , but two stars ? these things are amazing ! the only two cons i would have are that 1 ) they could be more portable : the "earpieces" don not rotate , so when you compress everything down to its most portable size , it is still more of a sphere than a circle
2 ) yes , i know that speakers are known for better sound , but i have had people sitting next to me be able to identify the song i am listening to because these things "leak out" so much sound
the main problem with this ( other than embarrassing yourself or annoying the person next to you ) is that they don not work very well for plane riding or anything where it is loud ( it was extremely difficult to hear many of the low notes in songs while on the plane last week )
other than those two things , these things are great
speaking of folding flat earpieces , one of my buddies used to have those similar sennheisers , ( i probably spelled that wrong ) and he used to lend them to me for a long time until i got these , but the spot where the wire went into the earpiece actually frayed to the point that that earpiece went dead ! so overall , i recommend these to anyone who just wants a cheap , yet very high quality pair of cans ( but check out the grado sr80i/60i , they may be a little bit less portable , but they are that much more amazing ! ) .
so it folds up
that is nice
it sounds pretty good
that is also nice
but it also feels pretty cheaply built and the connector is not at a right angle so i am expecting that the wire will begin to break near there from all the bending .
i own two pairs of these headphones and gave my son a 3rd pair for christmas
great sound , lightweight enough to go jogging with or wear around the house while doing chores
unlike earbuds , they stay in place
they are not indestructible- if you accidentally step on them , you will break them
but they do hold up just fine with normal wear and tear
highly recommended .
finally found them on sale for $25
the sound is great
there is an emphasis on base but that is ok , i am using this set with my flac player when i want music to wake me up and get me excited
i am very happy with the purchase
if however you are looking for the perfect balance of sound and frequencies spend more money ! for the average listener who just wants to get pumped , this is the set to buy
besides , if you are listening to an ipod or any mp3 why would you want to spend more on a headset ? there is only so much improvement that can be made considering the supression of the sound coming out of the device .
i have had a history with koss , and they provide such amazing sound quality ! two tips : 1
take care of them or they will get destroyed
try to keep them in your room ( or they will get destroyed ) .
i had a friend order this for me a while back from a site and i must say they are still working great
excellent , headphones for a decent price
so far , they have held up incredibly well over the year or so i have had them
they are very light and they haven not fallen apart or cracked anywhere at all , but still glad to have the koss warranty to replace them if i need to
the carrying case is a bit small so do watch out for that , but they will fit with a bit of finagling
i am a <NUM> year old college student , so i am on the go a lot
i keep them in my laptop bag and they fit right in
if i decide i want to be a tool and wear them around my neck , they are nice because they automatically adjust to their smallest headband size , so they fit around the neck more like a choker necklace
i also love getting looks from people
some comments include : "i like your headphones
""those are some wacky ass headphones man
""those are nice how much did they cost
""they sound amazing
"et cetera
pros : -i personally love the 80 is styling
-fold really small and are very portable
( duh ) -come with a carrying case that feels very high quality and protects them from me
-the ear cushions themselves do not feel like the cheap foam that i was expecting , they are actually closer to tempurpedic mattress foam , but a bit less squishy
-they ( used to ) automatically adjust to your head size without even having to touch them
i will explain below
-of course , the best thing , they sound great
cons : -they fold small , but not flat
the headphones are still as thick , when folded , as the diameter of the ear pieces and such
i really wish they folded flat , that would make these truly great
-they don not feel all that well made
( but have held up thus far ) -over the course of the year or so i have had them , the metal headband part has bent slightly , but i imagine it is from the times i have tried to fold them up too small , so be aware of that , i will explain below
-they will make your ears ache after a while ( an hour or so )
meh : -i don not like how small the carrying case is , if it wasn not so well made , i'd think i was going to rip the seams or something when putting my 'phones away
actually , it is not the case itself that is too small , as i can fit my mp3 player in the bag as well , but the opening
it doesn not open very wide
be careful not to snag anything when putting them away
-price is pretty cheap , but not exceptional , but i can not complain
-they don not noise cancel , but they are not noise cancelling headphones
i put this here because it is both good and bad
i like hearing my music in peace , but i also like being able to talk to my friends without having to remove my left earpiece from my ear
so they are okay for that
-they have a comfort setting on the sides , it is a switch you have to work
no , it is not an electronic switch for "bass boost" or anything like that , so don not get all excited
it is a mechanical switch that basically pushes the pieces against your head tighter
if you have it on the light setting and you move/fold the 'phones inward though , it will automatically jump to the firm setting i think
it is kinda gimmicky , but it does adjust the tension slightly
this will not prevent them from hurting your ears after a long period
so , as you can see , my cons and such are mostly about certain "bonus" features of the headphones
as a pair of headphones , they are the best i have ever had
okay , so as i wrote above , there are two things i have to elaborate on : -self adjustment : when i first bought these headphones , i could hold one side with one hand and simply lower them onto my head , and they would self adjust like some piece of alien technology
well , it is been a while and , while i do my best to take care of my technology , all the folding/unfolding of them , due to the nature of the design , has bent the headband slightly out of the circle it used to be in
it does not look any different aesthetically , but it inhibits the little magical fairy gnomes from doing their job as well as they did originally
and by "little magical fairy gnomes , " i mean "those black things on the metal headband that guide it through
" anyhow , not a huge deal , as it is still very easy to adjust
-folding the headphones : as i have said above , the constant folding/unfolding of the headphones will ( if you are not careful and you accidentally and repeatedly fold them up too tight without knowing ) bend the metal headband to the point where it won not as easily as it originally did
so , i am going to help you figure out how to fold them , so you can avoid bending your pair on accident
okay , so , it is pretty easy to do
the large plastic black pieces that hold the headphones fold inward
fold them as if you were pushing them into your ears
they will swing into the center of the arc of the headphones about the little piece with the head cushions
now , on each side of the hinge area , there is a loop and a hook
i don not remember which side is which , but you will see it
it is the end of the metal headband
hook the ends into the ends , and you will have a nice neat circle
now , you can move the little black slider pieces toward where you just hooked the headband to itself , but do not go too tight
this is how you will bend them
i would say you can slide them about an inch and a half away from the hinge where the earpieces fold in
now you should be good to go and they will stay nice and folded
anyhow , that is about all i have to say
these are well worth the money
i don not use them at home , because i have larger , more comfy headphones for that , but if i am out ? this is all i use
i generally hate earbuds , i always have , so this is how i listen to my music if i go out anywhere .
these are big on bass
i actually put some grado g cushions over the stock on here and that made them more balanced sounding
i haven not tried the kramer mod ( see headfi ) but could be the way to go
overall i would easily recommend these
if you have a bright sounding source , or great for movies .
the most amazing property of these headphones is that it is almost like you are wearing nothing
they are light and comfortable and the pressure of the ear pads is adjustable on both sides
these are probably the most comfortable headphones i have ever worn and i have owned many sets of headphones from sony , panasonic , seinheiser , ultrasone
the extra set of head pads above the ears reduces the pinching on the ears you get with most headphones
that said , the sound quality ( here i am using the word 'quality' literally , as in flavor , not how good the sound is ) is punchy and , at the sacrifice of high end and midrange
i tested these headphones with a sony lossless minidisc player with a flac audio source
these headphones are what i would call "teenager headphones
" they have sound properties that kids would look for
if you listen to a lot of music that has valuable high frequency sound properties you may wish to look elsewhere
the high and midrange on these headphones is a little muddy .
it has an amazing bass and great sound quality , adding a great price you get an amazing product ( the bad thing is that ii could be a little uncomfortable if you have a big head ) .
when i received the headphones i was pleasantly surprised
i had to find some that were cheap , as my turtle beach ear force z2 was damaged
i am glad i listened to the good reviews i found
surprisingly , the bass is deep , despite the size and type of headphones
if you like or not , that is a matter of personal taste
in my opinion , i had never bought a pair of headphones that were so cheap and also had such a good sound
one more thing : these headphones are not pretty , but its quality and durability are excellent .
the first thing i will say is that when i got these headphones they were a lot smaller than i envisioned
the retro look reminded me of some old headphones i had that were much larger
i suppose that is my fault though since they are sold as portables
pros : the sound quality is great for portables
they sound even better than some of the , studio headphones that i have
i have always liked koss' attention bass response in their headphones
the cord is just the right length for portable headphones at about <NUM> feet
don not get these if you like longer cords
they fold up very nicely and compact
it comes with a carrying case and 1/8 to 1/4 adapter
they are pretty light and comfortable , though a little tighter on wider heads
cons : they feel somewhat cheap and i imagine the actual hinge piece on the speaker driver snapping off over time ( the speakers are on a two way hinge for comfortable fit )
my head is on the larger side ( while not huge ) and i find these headphones the most comfortable on their largest setting
they don not seem to cater well to larger heads
i wish they had some kind of padding on the top of the headband
these are really good portable headphones with great sound quality , as long as your head isn not huge .
this are pretty okay in about every way
i suppose you might be disappointed , after waiting <NUM> years to buy them , but tough luck , pal .
they sound every bit as good as my headphones
i find them much more comfortable than the now popular
i think they are stylish -- geek style .
i am in my 24th year as host of a radio show on francisco
these are the headphones i have been using for the past four years : great sound quality and as important , very light and comfortable on the ear , so i can keep them on for the entire show and never feel at all uncomfortable
if you want to look like a pro , these aren not for you
they look like what a would wear
but if you want an amazing combination of sound quality , comfort , and low cost , these are great .
they are clear , crisp , and have just the right amount of bass
you can not ask for any better sound from this style of headphone
i have actually made a couple friends very angry when i told them to try my headphones , then ask what they cost , and then complain that they sound better than their $300 sennheisers .
if you have a <NUM> dollar budget for headphones
stop looking
add to cart and buy
i'd heard a lot about these throughout my internet travels , and finally had to give in and try them out
i am so glad i did
the sound exceeds my more expensive , klipsch image one , and i kind of like the way they look too
i am serious , though
don not let the looks fool you , the portapros are performers ! if these are anywhere near your budget , just get them
note : they are not by any stretch , but the fidelity more than makes up for this .
i listened with portapro in j&r ; <NUM> years ago , and i was pretty surprised for the sound , and bought itsince then , i fell in love with portapro family series ( portapro , sportapro , ktx pro ) they all sound excellent , full bass with its power , clean human voice and crisp treble , and they are all are pretty good headphones for portable ( portable cd/md players , mp3 players , pdas , laptops , even radios ) i often suggest other customers to buy portapro , and let them hear themselves , and they are happy with the soundthe only weakness is : the cable , it breaks easilyfor ktx pro users , you can order portapro earpads to get same great sound as portapro
audio quality is great for the price bracket , but they feel flimsy
however , i haven not goofed up and done anything bad to them yet
i just wish that the build quality was a little better so i wouldn not be paranoid every time i used them .
highly recommended on their own , and especially if you are wanting to spend less than $60 on headphones ( in fact , these are a lot less than $60 , almost half that )
i ordered my koss portapros from amazon after having to admit the sennheiser hd <NUM> phones i ordered in august <NUM> were not comfortable and had muddy bass
i wanted some good headphones to use in the late evenings when my kids are in bed , and i really wanted to love the hd202s
the reviews were great , the price was great , and they are "sennheisers"
all to naught
i should have listened to my gut and heeded the few reviews that commented on the boomy bass
i had a pair of the original koss portapros back in the mid 1980s and remember them very fondly
these current portapros are simply great headphones
they are clear , free from distortion , the bass is all there and punchy , not boomy or muddy in the least
the best thing i can say about headphones is that they don not just "sound good for headphones" , they produce a very good sound
and these koss have great sound - really , very excellent
to be objective - i don not think i'd be quick to let a child use these
while the build quality feels good , these aren not made for rough handling
if you want some incredibly rugged budget headphones to have around for kids to use on computers , mp3 players , portable dvd players , etc , you can not go wrong with the panasonic lightweight headphones
i buy these pair at a time and always have a pair or two still in the packaging ready to bring out as needed .
i have been looking for a set of headphones that i could use with my ipod touch
i have tried many earbud type sets as they are the best for portabilty
i could not find a pair that could give me a wide spectrum of sound at a decent price
i do have a pair of ultimate ears metrofi 150v that came pretty close to what i was looking for ( they were a steal at $16
00 shipped from dell )
however , i needed a pair of headphones that were comfortable for extended periods and most of all sounded great
well , after reading the reviews here i figured i would give these a try
i was shocked when i cranked up my ipod touch with some metallica and could hear all of the music without distortion
the koss are very "airy" and do not cut off the world around you yet they produce a very clear and natural sound that is hard to find in any other headset under $75+
i am very picky about sound since i used to do sound engineering for a <NUM> piece band and got used to hearing a live , wide range of sound with detail that is very percise
the bass response with the is natural and clean , the mids are natural and full and the treble is also clear and true
i am very pleased with these headphones and honestly the lifetime warranty sealed the deal
i remember when i was a kid in the early 70s
my father bought me a koss headphone set ( i cannot remember the model ) , but listening to the current top <NUM> music of the day from my simple record player , i remember how good those headphones sounded back then and how it would transport me into another world
looks like i just got back to my musical listening roots .
great highs , mids and lows , for a $35
00 headphone you cannot go wrong
i have the sennheiser px100 and may like these even more
more life and dynamics .
i had a pair of portapros for years and years
when they finally wore out , i didn not feel bad replacing them
i bought a second pair on amazon last year ( 2012 ) and the wire at the plug has already broken on them despite careful use
reading the sportapro review , the plug seems to be a weak link and i am afraid that the portapros have the same issue now
it is really a bummer , they used to be great
not sure what to replace them with .
okay , so these shouldn not be in the "noise cancelling" section
however , they are the portable headphones i have ever owned , period
simply powerful , deep , clear , intense bass , clear highs , and fantastically accurate midrange
and unlike many phones , they don not suck the lifeblood out of your poor little ipod
i have been through all sorts of earbuds and cans and found these after experiencing great sound on a previous set of koss earbuds
( i have never had any luck with the awkward fit of earbuds , but i can also highly recommend the plug by koss if you have no problem with them -- excellent bass and highs
) anyway , after comparing and contrasting these portapros to the other <NUM> pair i have bought over the years , there is absolutely no contest when it comes to sound reproduction
sure , they take up a bit more space than earbuds , but they do fold up quite nicely in the provided sack
i use them every day for two hours on the subway and they have gone thru the ringer
no cord problems , no sound problems
the foam rips over the pads after awhile , but with the lifetime warranty , no worries if you have any kind of problems
$5 in shipping gets you a brand new pair , no questions asked
lastly , yes
okay , they look mighty dorky -- my coworker saw them and told me to get out of the eighties
but really , it is all about the music , right ? those hipster dorks who shop at american apparel wish they had this kind of style !
i just bought these over the ear koss porta pro classic phones today
i traded in my ludacris soul sl99 is and some sennheiser cx310 is for cash and i purchased these
love the sound ! totally worth the deal it took to get these
tight , but not overpowering bass , and crisp mids and highs
i hear all the details in the music , plus the energy exhibited in these phones is just phenomenal for the price
i bought these based on their being a top <NUM> value pick on cnet , which ranked the klipsch s4 is as the top value headphones
i own two pairs of those , and the koss porta pros , and they couldn not be more accurate
retro look yet classy
tight fit
tight sound
great price
no complaints .
have used these headphones for the past <NUM> months mostly for travel , including on airplane , with an mp3 player and also at home with my computer
they are the best headphones i have tried , particularly at this price level , for sound quality
on an airplane , they perform better than the noise cancelling headphones i have used because they maintain the full spectrum of sound without the muffling sound i have encountered with noise cancelling headphones
because of the low distortion , i have been able to turn up the volume without hurting my ears to get past airplane noise
also , there is little sound leakage so when you do elevate the sound level , the passengers next to you won not be bothered as much by loud music
the headphones also fold handily so they are small enough to carry for portable use
at home , the headphones perform with excellence on higher quality playback devices so they are useful when you want to listen to music by yourself
i highly recommend these headphones
if asked about the negatives , i would say there are <NUM> things : the headband is a bit small and a bit difficult to adjust with the clip on metal - the design of these are old and this could be improved ; the cord is shorter than one would like ; and finally the earpiece is covered by foam like the old airplane headphones , which deteriorate over time ( but fortunately you can buy replacement foam cushions here on amazon very inexpensively and they are easy to replace
look around on the net for reviews and you will find these are very positively reviewed .
these koss portapros are the last headphones you will ever need ( with a few exceptions )
the lifetime warranty is great if they every break and certainly adds to the value of the purchase
the headphones for their size are surprisingly portable and fit almost any head
the metal band can occasionally catch your hair which is why it didn not receive <NUM> stars for comfort
this style of headphone by design doesn not have very good noise cancellation , which is why you may want to pick up a pair of ear bud style headphones for loud environments , but the portapros still do a decent job with the task
sound quality is superb for this price range there is none better than the portapros and they can hold their own against headphones with double the price
these are a must have for people who want to get the most out of their music and videos
highly recommended !
i was looking for a small light head phones to use in my office at work
still need to hear somethings going on around me
i didn not want an expensive set that i would have to lug home with me
researched the ratings on amazon and thought i would take a chance
hadn not really considered koss in many years
i have a few different sennheisers that i love but again wanted a small less expensive set
right out of the box i was wowed by the sound
i am sure they will improve once they are &<HASHTAG> ; burned in&<HASHTAG> ;
these are very light on my head and i have been wearing them for hours without any discomfort
there is a setting on the side for light for firm pressure ( the small blue tab shown in the picture just below the band )
not sure i can tell much of the difference but i set them on light
these things very small and can be stored in a small leatherette bag ( not a &<HASHTAG> ; case&<HASHTAG> ; ) and then fit great inside my desk drawer
again these had great sound and more bass than expected of something this size and cost
just a little tweeking with my sound settings on my siii and i was off and running .
i own some high end cans and i
these were bought as a walk around the house headphone
the big thing is : how does koss generate such a rich sound out of an inexpensive headphone ? i wish koss was still in the market as a high end headphone producer , but if you need the best for what these cost , go no further ! be a little careful when taking them off because the earpods will snap together quickly due to the metal head band
they are light , comfy and can be somewhat adjusted for head pressure
i love em !
i have had my koss portapro headphones for about three months
i read good things about them in my online research and was particularly interested in the fact that they were said to have excellent bass for portable headphones
in fact they do , as part of an overall rich , nicely balanced sound
i also find them to be comfortable and convenient ( they fold up into a small circle and fit into a handy pouch
) they appear to be well made and i anticipate using them for a long time
i also bought a pair of the cheaper koss pro1 phones in a amazon deal when i bought these , and they are excellent sounding portable phones as well
the metal construction of the portapros likely give them an advantage in durability ; the sound quality between the two is comparable
if you are interested in portable phones and want a better balance of highs , mids and more lows than you usually get with such phones ( enough low end so that you won not need to use the annoying , bass boost found on most portable players ) , with good construction to boot , i highly recommend the portapros
they will definitely sound much better than the phones that come with most devices .
the headphones work quite well
they don not feel like great headphones but they have held up pretty well and produce good sound
i use them on the treadmill as i don not like in ear headphones and they have held up well considering all of the sweat that has gone into them .
after <NUM> years with my pair , i finally blew out the diaphragms
bought <NUM> pair of bose headphones
was quite disappointed
like others have said , these units have changed little since the mid 80 is but have fanastic range , thump and boom
light weight comfortable and affordable
highly responsive coils and foldable design
highly highly recommended as ( in my opinion ) being the best portable , cancelling phones on the market
will make your mp3 player , walkman or discman much more robust sounding and gives very little ear fatigue , 'cept after <NUM> or more hours of use
getting another pair asap !
i bought the koss portapro headphones to replace the earbuds for my mp3 player
they are light , comfortable and have decent audio capabilities
you can fold them up and put them in my pocket
i am generally satisfied with them and would make the purchase again
my only gripe is that the earpieces tend to detach from the frame
there is only a small notch and groove holding them together
reassembling them when the earpieces come off isn not a huge hassle , but it is annoying .
this must be the 10th pair of headphones i have purchased in the last <NUM> years
but i have finally found the one
i read the other reviews and went with this one based on the quality of sound
and it is great ! i am amazed at how much bass these things produce ! they also fold up well and clip together
it should be easier to find the cord around them but that is just a minor annoyance .
i bought these over a year ago hoping that a company offering a lifetime warranty would provide a product that would last ; i am on my third pair
when they work , they are ok , but every <NUM> months the sound quality becomes so painfully bad i send them back
i suggest throwing your money elsewhere .
just unboxed these today and started listening to them , and my first impression is that they are quite possibly the simplest and most functional i have ever used
no frills , no sexy designs , no gimmicks , no extra features , just great sound and a fantastic , functional design that has withstood the test of time
i read the reviews that others gave and i thought "they can not be that good , " but for the price , i didn not have much to lose
earpieces work surprisingly well ; basically , it just gives you the ability to change how much pressure the headphones put on your ears
i find that my ears get sore with most headphones , but these are very comfortable
-the adjustable headband will fit any head size
i haven not got my hair caught in it yet
-they fold up for greater portability , and come with a very stylish leather bag ( probably fake leather , not sure )
-the sound is fantastic , better than anything in this price range
clear mids and highs , and decent bass that doesn not sound distorted when i crank it
they weren not that hard to figure out , but a simple sheet of paper with directions would have been nice
it took me a couple minutes to find out that you need to extend the headband , then clip together the earpieces , then retract the headband to make them small enough to fit in the bag
-i am sure the foam earpiece covers will wear out , but luckily they sell cheap replacements
-the leather bag is quite small , and the headphones barely fit inside
overall , great headphones
they do what they do , and nothing more
*update , one year later* : i accidentally pulled the cord out of my headphones
i shipped them to koss and they sent me back a brand new pair for free ( but i had to pay $9 for return shipping )
no nonsense or forms to fill out , just a new pair of headphones in about a week
koss , you have gained a lifelong customer .
omg ! these are incredible ! i never thought i would get sound this good from such a small pair of headphones ! the bass is unbelievable ! they have the puchiness and crisp sound i want ! you can hear and feel drum beats as if you were right there with the band ! the treble is also quite good , you can hear everything
the voices are smooth and not high pitched , everything is balanced pretty well
but i feel the treble could be a touch higher
i don not know if the bass is intentionally enhanced , but it sounds a lot louder on these then any other headphones i have
but i like it , certainly makes my music sound more alive and in your face
also worth noting , these have a nice soundstage , or stage presence if you will
mostly because they don not cover around your ears
it would be great if koss made a version of these in an over the ear circumaural design
it would be nice to hear how it sounded
for a small portable headphone where sound isolation is not required , these are my babies
here is what i own as of this review , to show you to what im comparing from
onkyo recieverkoss ur29koss the plugpanasonic porta pro ( of course )
we have a split family , and so it is great to have amazingly clear headphones that can fold up , that they love and move easily between homes without getting damaged
great purchase !
i bought these for my husband and he loves them
we are both more comfortable using the over the ear earphones rather than the ear buds that came with our ipods
he uses them for home and travel .
impressive set for the money , but obviously not professional quality
it does indeed catch hair and can hurt to pull off at times
if you want a good cheap headset , this is an impressive option for the price range it is in .
pros- great sound ! , portable , incredibly comfortable , they just look coolcons- not so durable , cord feels cheapi saw these on cnet as some of the best headphones along with ones that cost 100 is of dollars and thought i'd give them a try
i am not disappointed , they look great and sound even better
they fold up to a small size too and can fit in your pocket
they even come with a nice leather carrying pouch .
i had a pair when i was in college back in the mid '70s and they were tops then
great sound hi and low
not for deep mega bass as it will not carry the bass punch
all others
get your koss on and enjoy comfortable headphones that are lightweight and custom fit to your ears and head for rich , full sound .
i have been having grado labs sr60 and sr80 for a couple of years , but koss portapro always rings into my mind as they are much cheaper , and they are supposed to be really good with a sound signature somewhat similar to my grados
okay , i finally pulled trigger two weeks ago
my initial impressions are ( only burned in for about <NUM> hours )
- bass is a little too much ( that is expected and is a selling point for portapros )
but with eqing , i can make it a bit better to my taste
- sound is not too clear overall ( comparing with grados of course ) , but this may improve over time with more burned in ( based on my prior experiences )
my sources are very decent mp3 players and laptop with external sound card
no external amps were used in any way
in the end , portapro lives within my expectations
i like them for their compact shape , portability ( which grado lacks ) , comfort ( slightly worse than grados )
i think these are not as good as grado labs sr60 and sr80 , if a straight comparison has to be made
value wise , i would go to sr60 if you can buy used
if you only buy new electronics , then these are really good values .
i am very fussy about my music and the headphones that deliver that music must be good
the sound from these headphones is crisp and clean
i sometimes feel like i am in the recording studio because i can hear every little nuance
the bass is present but not overwhelming
they are very comfortable to have on over long periods of time
they cover the ear but don not keep you from hearing what is going on around you
i don not like earbuds but didn not want huge headphones either
these are just right in size
they are adjustable both in length and in pressure against the ears
they fold up for travel
i have bought other headphones and keep coming back to these as my favorite
i think the price is incredible for the quality
i highly recommend them .
i really can not add more than others have written
yes , i got my hair snagged the first couple times
once i figured how to take em on and off it is been no big deal
the sound quality is fantastic
bass is present in spades
highs are well defined and haven not gotten tinny on me
i am not a fan of too much mid range and these give me all the highs and lows i want
comfy too
to the point i despise putting buds on when i workout
may get a 2nd pair just for working out
this is one product where the reviews on amazon are dead on
can not recommend these highly enough .
i may not be a audiophile , but these headphones sound great ! i was surprised by the deep bass in this headphone
some may be put off by it , but i personally enjoy it
don not be fool by the picture of the portapro
they are quite thin and small when collapsed
these are definitely not headphones that you should be bouncing around in since it is so flimsy
overall , for the price , these are great sounding headphones for the price
i wanted a pair of headphones that were lightweight , convenient to carry in my sling bag , and offered decent sound while being affordable
this set meets all of my criteria and i am very pleased with them .
these earphones have been around a long time for a reason
although not as clear as bose earphones , you cannot beat these earphones for the money
they work very well with an ipod
the bass is especially good , and the music itself is a lot more precise than with the normal ipod earbuds
these earphones are well worth the money .
after spending some time creating various playlists on spotify , i quickly realized that listening to all those wonderful selections through my laptop speaker just didn not do justice to any of the songs
being on a tight budget , i researched various bluetooth speakers and bought the jbl flip
the difference between the laptop speaker and the flip was , needless to say , outstanding
so i started listening to my playlists while working on the laptop and was quite happy to realize that i could turn up the volume quite high on the flip without experiencing any distortion
unfortunately , my wife wasn not as enthralled as i was with my late night listening habit
i tried listening to the songs with the volume turned down quite low , but lost the enjoyment of hearing all the details i could hear at a higher volume
still being on a tight budget , i researched headphones and bought the koss portapros
i can not believe how much better the music sounds on the portapro compared to the flip
all the raves you read from other reviewers are true , but can you see my dilemma ? the flip sounds better than the laptop , and the portapros sounds better than the flip
i am now thinking that i will have to take out a home equity loan to move up to the next level
for the time being , however , i am extremely satisfied with the portapros and will continue to listen to my music at whatever volume i want without irritating my wife .
koss portapro headphones with case broke on me after a year or so of use
the cable in particular
cheaply made cables , go with
over three years old now and still work like a champ
sound good
i have owned these about a year now
-well frequency price for external sounds to be heard ( this is good for me , but maybe bad for others ) -lifetime warranty with registrationi have a pair of bose triport headphones , ultimate ears stuido3 is , and shure e2c
i pick up the portapros every single time by preference
the type block out other noises if you want that , but for me this is one of the nice features of the portapro
i can turn the music on medium and still hear if somebody is driving up behind me , trying to talk to me or trying to kicking down my door
if i set the music low i liken it to having a conversation with somebody and the music is in the background
as somebody that is very critical of everything i buy , i can say these exceeded my expectations
i thought i would like the type , but they are uncomfortable and if the seal in your ear canal is not perfect they have very poor frequency response
if you are looking for a nice pair of affordable headphones quit looking and buy portapros
once you get them go to koss' website and register them for a lifetime warranty
you are set with great phones for a long time .
i bought the koss porta and the my grado i80 poofed into disintegration
i am poor so who cares
lets go
the koss portapros are great if you are using an i pod such device
the sound they give is very clear and crisp
i actually hooked them up to my onyko <NUM> rms surround sound system at <NUM> volume level and they did not blow they did crackle but these are not a stereo headphone but close
the koss portapro is the best lightweight headphone for hearing all the great variety of pings and pongs with booms for the money
the displacement with these is incredible
the sound comes in so clear and uniform you almost think your in the studio but not quite
they are worth it
i bought the pana
screw it look above
these are great head phones the song displacement is no where near as good as the koss
koss has a lot higher range than the panasonic
the panasonic i think were designed to give a bigger bass with less treble in the high notes but they sound the best at the highest volume
i personally like that
you listen to music loud to get into it
so you have to listen to these cans loud to enjoy them
they are very good and better than akg m80 mk11
for the price ( 10 bucks cheaper that the koss )
so whos the best
the koss portapro got it down in the sound department and the construction is very good
koss also stood up to my stereo
the panasonic sound muffled compared to the koss but not that much
panasonic also can be played on your stereo and they vibrate with bass on your head
this can be annoying though
the panasonic are built though wires won not fall out and you can depend on them on a <NUM> rms system to deliver the better than paid price for the sound
they are ok no sennheiser or grado , sony mdr sound quality
i choose the koss for my ipods and laptops
but i choose the panasonic for a pretty good home surround sound system
these are <NUM> different headphones
one is used for ipods and laptops the other is designed for everything
you like sound get koss
you want everything with a lack in areas get the panasonic
they are both constructed by someone who thought about the design
boy is that important .
if you don not mind looking like you should be listening to a tears for fears cassette on your enormous walkman , these are fantastic especially for the price
lightweight and comfortable with bass response you shouldn not be able to reasonably expect from open air type headphones , especially at this price point
i don not mind the eighties look to them , they rock in any decade
but tomorrow i do think i will run in enormous striped tube socks pulled up to my knees , just to complete the look .
i got a pair of sportapros , ksc75s and these to see how the sound is in each of them when they are supposed to have the same driver
and to be fair , i was confused
each headset has it is own distinct feature and advantage
very frankly speaking , the portapro is price is what i believe koss cashing in on the hype , since frankly speaking i do not see the <PERCENT> increase in any way
that being said , the portapros do sound the best of the lot , because it feels like it has a slightly wider soundstage
i guess that is since the sportapros have a solid plastic plate almost covering the speakers , hence kind of "closing" it up a bit
the ksc75 have it in them to sound as good as these two , but the lack of any pressure to hold the speakers closer to the ear result in most of the sound leaking out , hence the huge drop in bass
press the speakers close to the ears with your hand and you will get what i mean
comfortwise , i would say the ksc75s win by a mile
you won not even feel that you have a pair of earphones on
the pads are good , comfy , and the same for all the three , but here the lack of pressure on the ears plays to the advantage of the ksc75s
sportapros definitely look odd
the ksc75s look uglier
love the design idea of the sportapro though , the conversion to a fit is genius , and definitely a worthy option given the metal band of both sportapro and portapro being always hungry for the hair follicles around it
the portas and the sportas both come with a nice faux leather pouch , in which you can curl both of them in to a cute little ball and toss in
the sportas came with a nice gold plated 3
5cm to 1/4" adapter as well
packaging wise , portapro is miles aahead of the rest ( well they are almost twice as expensive as the sportapros ! )
the ksc75s do not have any bells and whistles in the pack , but then again it is almost 1/3rd the price of portas
the only concern in any of the three headphones was the adapter of the ksc75s , which do not have any protective ridging for the wires coming out of it , make me skeptical about the longevity of the connection
the ksc75s are the best bang for the buck definitely
but again , even the most expensive portapro is less than half the price of it is closest competitor from another company
but seriously kudos to koss for making some of the best headphones i have heard in my life and at prices the others can only go green on .
i have read many reviews of portapro and have done some research for this headphones and other competitors like sennheiser and akg
i have to choose one of them because of limited budget haha
i chose this one because of my friend
he has koss sportapro which produces great sound and incredible bass
that is what i want
i am very pleased with portapro
very nice high and sound and impressive bass
i didn not say that this headphones are the best because some people still like sennheiser or akg
i think it is not much comfortable even if you adjust it to comfort mode
moreover , even if you fold it , it is still bigger than pouch included in package
however , i chose portapro because of sound ( and price )
if you like powerful bass headphones and very nice and sound , portapro will make you happy .
considering the price tag on these headphones , the sound is amazing
you won not find better sound for this much money
even if you upgrade to something better , these are good to keep around for working out , doing chores around the house , etc
, since they are lightweight and fit pretty snugly
i have owned mine for a year now and they still sound great
update : i have owned these for more than two years now , and i have treated them like crap -- wearing them when i work out , when i am doing chores , working on the house , etc
they are indestructible , and they still sound great
i have gone through at least three pairs of headphones in the same amount of time
buy these -- they will last you years
you do have to get used to having a line imprinted on your head after using them for more than five minutes at a time , but i guess you can not have everything .
great sound for the price ! don not be alarmed at the style of these headphones because they are not the size of those big , closed back reference/monitor earmuffs
these are the smaller &<HASHTAG> ; walkman&<HASHTAG> ; style
i was surprised at the size , because the photos make them seem large
good bass and treble response , but i can see how they could get broken easily
just take care of them and they will be ok
a little weird trying to fit on your head for the first time
the package depicted ( plastic clamshell ) is not the package i received
i received a very nice upscale black box packaging with a photo of the headphones on them ( in the style of ipod packaging )
pros - lightweight and comfortable , even for people with glassesgood soundgreat pricecons- a little flimsy ( mostly because of the metal band ) compared to my larger audio technica is they match up well
the main difference is in the bass response and loudness
it takes a little more power to drive the is so the koss is louder the closed back of the is provide a little less treble and more of a &<HASHTAG> ; surrounding&<HASHTAG> ; live sounding bass compared to the koss
but it is just a matter of preference
the at is are also heavier and glass wearers will be hurting for sure
i will keep the is for the studio and the koss for general listening
you can not go wrong with the portapro is .
these cans are not as good as my grado sr80s ; however , they are very good
the bass is realistic
the highs are crisp
the midrange is balanced with the bass and highs
i don not transport them very much ; however they do fold up and store quite nicely
one thing which i consider a real plus is the metal band across the head
the band makes it absolutely simple to adjust the width , between ears , of the drivers without damaging the headset
for a set of sub-$50 cans these are a great choice
i have heard that the koss isn not as good as these koss
if that is the case i'd stay away from them and get the instead
unlike my grado sr80s these drivers do not require additional amplification when used with my ipod or ipod touch .
the audio quality is crisp , basses are awesome
im not an audiophile but i really notice the difference , which is big , between these and other headphones
the music played by these can be played at low volumes and i can tolerate
very clear
one thing though , music is leaked really bad by these after bout <PERCENT> wich is bad cuz u know ppl can hear what you hear , and to me i dont like
its plastic and aluminium , not the most durable of materials but hell with a lifetime warranty whos complaining
its either these or some 100+ headphones
take these
your wallet , and ears will thank you .
sounds good , but not great
will do the job
would not recommend for music
what else can i say about them ?
i bougt my koss porta pro in <NUM> for usage on a walkman
the day i bought it i believe must have changed my life ; - ) up to now ( 16 years ! ) i did not find any portable headphone that delivers more sound
what makes this headphone so special is the dynamic it reproduces
the bass and treble that comes from this tiny package sounds like you are in front of a speakerwall
there are no words to describe the atmosphere it creates
when listening to classic music concerts its like you are there
when listening to a singer its like the stage is in front of you
when listening to pop , rock , disco , dancefloor , techno - you name it - it delivers the pump you would expect from big speakers
the clear vibrant trebles and the full deep bass it produces are just stunning
i still remember the first time i used those , the sound was so amazing it gave me this warm fuzzy feeling in the upper stomach area and left me speechless for a moment
note that over time the earpads and the pads which are supposed to hold the headphone in place will wear out and eventually come off
this can be a major turnoff when you want to go jogging with it
i dont recommend wearing them long time or when you want to sleep ( because of the pressure on the ears )
the little blue "comfortzone" switch is supposed to set how firm the headphone is attached to your head
i don not think that is working as advertised , whatever the settings it didn not feel any different for me
the headphone is very light and foldable
when folded they are the size of a small apple
the headphone comes with a softcase
summary : the speakers are not as compact as plugs but definitely have a better form factor than most pro headphones
the fact that mine are worn out after many years of usage but still used confirms that the sound itself is well worth the price
when listening - especially first time - be prepared to be left speechless
as mentioned above they have a few short comings ( which product doesnt ? ) but it is still a product with well deserved <NUM> stars !
my only problem with these is a big one for me ; comfort
after maybe an hour or so , they begin to really hurt my ears
people rave on here about how comfortable they are , i don not get it
i have an average size head , so i don not think my ears or dome piece is the issue
the circular foam pads around the speakers are very thin and the round speaker pieces underneath have hard edges that press through the foam and onto your ear
after a while it begins to hurt
not like make you bleed and cry hurt , but just slight dull pain from pressure
i have had these for about a year and use them daily at work
i still haven not gotten used to them , i doubt my ears will develop defensive callouses
other than that , these have good sound and look cool for the money
edit : i have had these for about a year and a half
i am about them and definitely don not love them
they have not stopped hurting my ears , but i have gotten somewhat tolerable to it
fyi , back then i purchased the grado at the same time , and found them to also have the same , extremely uncomfortable padding so i returned them
i kept the koss phones since they were cheap and didn not require a headphone amp or purchasing an additional plug adaptor
i have been looking for headphones since then , so if anyone has any recommendations on an upgrade that is comfy and sounds amazing , i'd love to hear from you
happy shopping .
for the money this is a good quality piece
the wide metal band is durable but at the same time awkward because it is so wide
there were only two problems
one is that it hurts my ears a little
but that is livable
the other is that it advertises that it comes with a "case" which is actually a cheap plasticy bag that is slightly smaller then the headphones
i really need a carrying case so i will have to find something else stronger and a little large so i can carry this in my pack without destroying it .
great sound out of these guys , they have an excellent bass reproduction , and treble is where it should be , overall a wonderful balance
the midrange is excellent , with instruments apparent i didn not know were there
they are also very light , so if you are confident enough in how they look , you can wear them around
the main point of my review was to say they are iphone friendly , atleast the ones i got from amazon directly
would definitely recommend if you need something under a hundred dollars .
i bought a set of the koss porta pro headphones based on reviews for my creative nomad 2c mp3 player which i also got from amazon
i don not think that a lot people realize that the limiting factor in listening to the mp3 format beside the size of the file is the set of headphones that you use
although they are not as accurate as my grado sr <NUM> phones , they sound very good and are light enough to be used on the go
for small headphones they sound pretty open and detailed
they bass is very good
so good in fact that i turned down the bass eq on my mp3 player just a bit to bring the midrange forward and keep the voices from getting tubby
the treble is very clean sounding
if you got an mp3 player , do yourself a favor and replace the stock headphones with these
i am pretty picky about sound quality
the koss porta pro headphones bridge the gap between light weight , portable and delivering a musical experience .
night and day difference between these and either of my old sony headphones
blows away nano earbuds
money well spent .
yes , they look strange
yes , they look like a futuristic design from the 1980s--and indeed , they are from the 80s
however , for the ( under $60 or so ) there is no comparison
still none
these things have been on the market for ages , and folks still rightly rave about them
i remember using these babies on an old sony sports walkman ( tape ) and the sound was amazing--big , fat bass , and loud
these are unmatched for bass , period , in portable headphone in this price range
they put the others to shame
yes , they are , and slightly awkward to fold up , and the metal clip in the middle might rip out a hair or two
but if you are more concerned with the best sounding portable headphones for a discman or an ipod rather than looking cool on the street with ( but inferior ) headphones , these things are perfect
highly recommended
no accident that koss ( an american company , no less ) hasn not changed up the design of these in ages--they don not have to
if you want something a little isportier' and smaller , try the sportpro
not as powerful , deep , or loud , but excellent in their own right .
for a , dare i say , cheap pair of headphones , the sound is great
my biggest complaint is adjusting the fit is tedious
the "comfort zone" switch always pops back to the tightest setting unless you first get the headphones situated and then carefully slide the switch while being careful not to bump the pivot point and pop the switch back to firm
also , the adjustable headband fights against it is own springiness and it is hard to make it hold at anything other than wide open or completely closed
finally , if you slide the headband adjustment while the headphones are on your head , you will almost inevitably pull hair into them
if you don not plan on folding them up much for transportation , i would recommend looking at a different pair .
i bought these after comparing multiple different headphones
i was going to choose other headphones although the review on cnet changed my opinion
there are really only two upsides to these headphones
1 ) they sound good , particularly in the low frequencies , and 2 ) they fold up small
so what are the downsides ? 1 ) any time you take them off they shrink back down to their original size
you have to readjust them every time , which gets annoying fast
2 ) the things looks hideously ugly
3 ) even though they have a setting to control how hard it squeezes you head , the pad above the speaker part rests on the side of your head and it will soon start digging into the side of your mellon
admittedly i have a larger than normal head , but these were very uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time
i finally fixed this problem by bending the metal band out ( a lot )
this modification made it so they don not fold up as small anymore
4 ) there is a hook above the right ear that you use to latch the headphones closed when stored
this hook rubs on my ear if i am not careful , which very quickly causes pain to the top of my ear
5 ) if the band adjusts while you are wearing the headphones there is a good chance it will suck your hair into the band which isn not a problem until you try to remove them , which quickly becomes unpleasant when you realize what has happened
as a note , my hair isn not long , in fact i keep it with a military type crew cut , so this is a problem for anyone with head hair , regardless of length
overall , given the choice to go back in time , i would have selected different headphones
i got these on sale , and the price is pretty good , however they just aren not very comfortable
bending the top band helps , but then they don not fold up as small
they do sound really good , but they also don not block out outside noises .
these headphones are ugly but sound great , they are also very comfortable
perfect for home , i wouldn not wear these out as they are goofy looking and are not
pros- sound is great , bass and all
- ipod/iphone friendly plug
- lightweight and comfortable
- the price is right
cons- need to the head band occasionally when you put them back on as it will slide when you take them off
- not very cool looking , i would probably buy these in black if i was ordering again .
i don not hear high frequency very well so take my sound review for what it is worth
good bass and sound ; very pleasant sound quality
crank up the power and they do not over drive or distort
these are not sound expert headphones , but they sound as good as or better than the bose head p[hones i have tried
they fit comfortably on the ear but will slip some if one moves the head too quickly
i like the durable head band molded into the plastic
they fold up very nicely for storage in the bag
cord length is sufficient without being too long
i like them but they were purchased for my grandson ; now we will see how durable they are
great value for a reasonable price from amazon .
i have been debating to buy these for a long time
finally i did and i am very happy i did
sound is the best i have heard from this size headphones and it is also much more comfortable than i first thought it would be
i cannot tell how it looks , since i am wearing it
but who cares if the sound is so good .
my girlfriend swears that these are the best headphones she is ever had
call me crazy , but i feel as though they are starting to sound better than my grado too .
they work well and seem very strong
more than enough length on the cord and extremely great sound .
surprising good sound for the money
these things sound too good to be used for workouts
they have foam earpads and those thing will get nasty with sweat
i use these at work and i couldn not be happier with them .
let me start off by saying i have owned these for many months and have enjoyed them thoroughly
the sound quality is amazing , clear voice , nice bass and not too much that it is overpowering
to the people saying they feel cheaply made , mine went through an hour in the washer and then into the dryer and are still working as well as they did on day one
they are fairly comfortable for what they are , they fit great under a hoodie , there is an adjustment to set it to your comfort level
i highly recommend .
who woulda guessed that the best sounding headphones under $100 would be a portable version ?
i use the headphones to listen to tv and pc
they are lighter and smaller than the picture led me to believe , which is a good thing
the side foam pads , for your temples really help keep the pressure off your ear
but this pressure is also adjustable by sliding tabs on the tops of the headphone part
so you can get just the right amount of pressure
the sliding metal bands allow for a large range of size
with the sliding metal bands and a hinged earpieces the unit folds up to a compact size
i really like these but i never give five stars .
the koss portapro are great set of headphones for the ipod classic
i read other people reviews and majority of them being very positive so i gave them a try
wow , the sound that comes from these headphones are great ( no static/noise )
the fit of these is very comfortable and adjustable to any size
i thought the metal would bother me ( i shave my head ) but no problem here i do not feel them
if you are looking for a great set of headphone that will not break the bank and sound great look not further .
you have to here these to believe it
i went to a big electronics place where i live and they have alot of headphones on display and i mean alot , i brought a cd player in with me and the koss headphones to compare , i tried some that were $100 or more and they did not sound as good or better than these
and when the foam padding wears out , you can replace them , which you can not on the expensive ones , you can get the foam pads through amazon also
the headphones are great , however a few issues that i had
1st pair , left speaker phone after <NUM> weeks use , 2nd pair , left speaker after <NUM> weeks of normal use
only other comment ( not complaint ) the comfort zone adjustment defaults automatically to firm , and will not stay on the light adjustment
great speakers , poor design and manufacturing
companies like koss , do not like constructive , input , but i will give them another try
after all , i live in , nc , aka bob moog ( god bless , r
) aka asheville , nc , former home to bob moog and current home to the moog museum and and of course
asheville , nc
music capital of the carolinas
love and joy
btw , amazon has been wonderful to deal with regarding my returns and replacements , that is why i continually shop amazon , not walsmart or or targot or bust buy
shop amazon !
sound of koss portapros is truly remarkable
great sound for any price ! my one complaint is that they are a little heavy and not quite as comfortable as i would like
works best when clips on side of each headphone are pushed back for loosest fit
also , wish the headphones were a little more portable
they don not really fold up as small as i would like
lest i sound like too great a critic , i would purchase them again
in fact , i sent my a pair for christmas .
excellent sound for the money
i only got to use them for a short time and wife discovered them
she loves them and won not give them back .
i got these to replace my <NUM> yr old senn px <NUM> which suddenly got broken at the miniplug , these are not as comfortable as the px <NUM> but they do sound great and give you more bass because they are tighter against your ears but with an offer from another site which ended costing me just $5
00 i could not pass them up
they are also very sensitive which makes them ideal for ipods and other portable devices .
these headphones are some of the best i have ever had ! sound quality and comfort are excellent
where have they been all my life ? if you are considering purchasing these headphones don not hesitate , just do it
they are well worth the money !
i have had a terrible time finding headphones that i can wear for more than <NUM> minutes
first , i wear glasses , so that rules out a lot of "over the ear" headphones because it pushes the frames right into the sides of my head
the alternative , then , would be to use earbuds
i can not use earbuds though , because the insides of my ears are extremely sensitive due to multiple infections as a child
i didn not think i had an alternative
fortunately , i came across these
for comfort , these things are a dream
i actually forget that i am wearing them sometimes , which is a first for any headset i have owned
the pressure is applied above the ears as much as i'd like ( it is adjustable ) and i can change how much pressure is on my ears and the side of my head
, they *seem* to be fragile--specifically , the part where the speakers connect to the headphone frame--however i have often stuffed them in my coat pockets ( yes , they are that small when folded up ) where they have been squished against my shoulder bag and i have dropped them several times
it is all part of being a klutz
i have yet to do any damage to them , however
that is more than i can say about my portable mp3 player
complaints : the bag seems a bit small , even with the "correct" way you put them in
i would have liked it if they made the opening a touch bigger so you could slip them in and out more easily
i have stopped using it altogether , but i use them every day for at least an hour so it doesn not matter too much for me
as for quality of sound , they have been excellent for me
i listen to a wide variety of classical , rock , and world music , and it is handled all of them quite well
i don not know how this would compare to , say , a $100+ headset , but for the price listed or under i think it'd have to be the best out there
for comfort , i am not sure if these can be beat .
my dad has had them for <NUM> years , they still work as if they were new
my bro has them , i have had them for a year
and have gotten <NUM> people to get them too
nothing beats them , period
they deliver an incredible sound performance , feel great , don not leak too much , isolate a fair amount of surrounding noise , are unbreakable and extremely portable
get them with no hesitation .
at first my son wasn not sure about the retro look of these head phones
now that he saw them in person , he wears them everyday
first pair came and the right didn not work
amazon quickly exchanged it
great deal
i have been a portapro enthusiast for the past 4+ years
you have already read the hundreds rave reviews of the portapro is phenomenal sound and being that i am in agreement with them all , i have little to add
i have several head phones from different manufacturers such as akg , sony , and sennheiser and these beat all the more expensive open air and closed air headphones i have
the only headphones that are better are variety which i use conditions with a lot external noise such as on planes and working out at the gym
however , recently i have fallen out of love with my portapros and i think there are a lot of portapro users who are in the closet about this particular design flaw that i am about to elaborate on
first of all , let me explain that i have several mp3 players
recently , i acquired mp3 players with large amounts of flash memory ( 16gb )
because of the long battery life inherent in these players ( 25 to <NUM> hours ) , i am pretty much listening to them all day long , along with my portapros
i wear these instead of the better sounding isolation earbuds because i need to hear the phone and be able to talk to people while wearing them
with my extended hours of usage , i have been noticing that when i remove my portapros , about <NUM> times out of <NUM> they pull at least one of my hairs out
i have developed a method of slow removal combined with pushing together adjustable metal frame that reduces the instance of this
this acts to release any hairs that have been captured by the sliding mechanism
however , because many times , i have to answer the phone quickly , i find myself having to pull off the portapros at more normal speed -- and this results in too many instances of unauthorized hair removal
because of the great sound of the portapro , i have been will to put up with it
until last night
last night i was at office depot and on a whim i purchased the sony fontopia earbuds ( with the case ) for about <NUM> bucks
these are the most generic basic earbuds that sony makes
over the years , i have owned several of these and my experience with them was that these were headphones with sound
but when i plugged them in , i was in for a pleasant shock
these sounded great
they must of done some design improvements since i last tried them
excellent full spectrum sound for metal , jazz , classical -- everything i listen to
tight , natural bass response that , in my opinion , is at least <PERCENT> of the greatness of the portapro -- all for a measly <NUM> bucks
better sounding than the other headphones i have that cost several times as much
long story short
i have switched to sony fontopia is for the time being
the fact that they are not "in the ear" allows me to hear the phone and talk to people
but best of all -- no hair pulling
i still like the portapros for their sound
in fact a week ago , i wrote an email to koss explaining the problem and they politely explained they were working a solution that didn not compromise the positive qualities of the current design
that is cool
i will be waiting
for now , i have hung up my portapros
if there are other folks out there who have a problem with hair pulling like i did , the sony fontopia are a nice alternative for the being
revision 2/28/2011in recent months , i have migrated back to using my portapros
i am just more careful when i take them off
there is nothing else like the sound on these babies
while i hope you guys fix the hair pulling , you are back to <NUM> stars .
i have had <NUM> other pair of these headphones , and i have never been disappointed
the sound is great and they seem to last forever
the other <NUM> pair ? my wife got one and my daughter got the other
they are especially good if earbuds don not work for you
like they fall off your head a lot
sennheiser have great sound , too , but i had <NUM> pair of those and in both cases , the sound on one side went out
the first time , i got another pair of , but the second time , i got the
can not imagine you'd be disappointed with these
except maybe aesthetically
they do look a bit utilitarian .
oh koss portapro , how do i love thee ? let me count the ways : this pair of headphones is my favorite pair of portable headphones i have ever owned ( just barely edging out my sennheiser headphones i owned for years )
they are highly compact and yet still pack a punch , providing rich full sound and , *gasp* , decent bass output as well ( something severely lacking in most headphones )
the case is also wonderful
i very , very rarely leave the house without these headphones
they fit snugly and are barely noticeable , even after hours of use
my somewhat trivial gripe with this product is that , as a male with short hair , the retractable metal band will pull out a single hair every now and then
very painful and somewhat frustrating , but not worth taking a star away , my family is been using these headphones for well over <NUM> years now and i have yet to find much better for the price .
recommended by cnet , these headphones are light , portable , and have the best sound i have heard in this price range
i originally bought them for a laptop , and now i use them on every audio device i own
great product , excellent price .
i have those for almost <NUM> year now and i just love them
they will not insulate the surrounding noise like the type phones , but they sound perfectly - very balanced ( enough bass , clear highs and enough mids ) and are comfortable to wear
i am finding myself preferring them among the sets of different headphones i own for anything on my laptop and on my portable when i am listening to music evenings at home
highly recommended for any purpose at relatively silent surroundings
edit : one earpiece easily broke when they fell from the table on the floor
way too easy
not that durable at the end
taking some stars back .
purchased this to replace my $10 sony ear buds
sony is not bad , but sounds a little dry and boring
i was surprised to hear the sound improved even when connected to a pc
bass sounds more natural ( not over emphasized as woofers do ) , and sounds fuller
ma sounds better with this compare to sony
even though this is supposed to be on the comfortable side of headphones , i still feel uncomfortable after using it for a while
i think it is the case for almost any headphone
however , this is not the best for conversation
i prefer my cheapo ear bud for skype , which sounds a lot clearer
this is not a surprise since all telephones actually do filtration similar to that ear bud is frequency response to make conversations clearer and save system resources
by the way , i got a chance to try a koss
this portapro beats td hands down in sound quality
if you enjoy music , but not on an am radio or very compressed files , give this a try
update : to improve the clarity in conversation ( skype ) or vocal , i cut a hole in the center of the foam pad
now everything works beautifully
by the way , its cheaper to order replacement pads through amazon
koss charges $5 for a pair , while amazon sells a pack for the same price .
the sound is great , the fit is great , but the cushions are wearing off after while
well guess that is kinda expected and falls under normal wear and tear
these headphones are great ! i have been using them around town for about two weeks
they sound really good
the bass isn not overly punchy or overwhelming but sounds really nice
the whole sound is very clear through the linkin park , incubus , pendulum , bonobo , and some other tracks that i have listened to with these headphones
my only complaint is that they feel a bit flimsy and i try to be really careful with them
so far , i have dropped them once and they are fine .
i just needed an improvement for home listening while on my computer
these are better than my old ones and avoids all the popping sound .
i agree that and and they are very good headphones
but they slipped off my hands one day and broke
update : on the other hand , i mailed them back to koss and got them replaced , no questions asked ,
these are outstanding headphones for the price , with excellent response across the frequency spectrum , and especially robust bass for such a small , lightweight set
a friend recently visited me with a just purchased set of large , type headphones
though his cost nearly three times as much he was chagrined to find , after listening to a comparison , that the koss headphones sounded better
a lifetime guarantee never hurts , either .
i have owned two units so far and have gifted another one
at $50 , you'd be amazed with the sound these deliver
i bought one years ago - and they worked fantastic until one of the side gave out
that was when i discovered the lifetime warranty from koss ! i mailed them the piece - explaining what was wrong and about $8 s/h
and sure enough in four days they sent me a new unit ! for the one i gifted , i was on the fence about beats , sennheisers , and bose
tried them all out and personally i think the koss ones sounded way better ( and looked cooler too )
i know the bose fans will hate this - but if they closed their eyes and didnt know which ones they were listening - i bet they would agree koss sounds better or at least as good as the bose phones .
i wear glasses and am very picky about over the head headphones
this one has nice design with support at the temple to relieve pressure at the ears , so doesn not push on the frame
sound isn not bad either
i use it at office and when i go out for walks during the day and it feels comfy for extended periods of use .
i have own porta pros since the middle 80 is
they were my first good pair of headphones and i still have a pair today
back when i first got them i thought these were a god send
they simply blew me away
i had never heard a pair of cans with such deep detailed bass
but then again i was used to listening to the cheap stuff that came with walkmans
so the porta pros were a big step up the food chain
more then twenty years later and about five different pairs ( the thin wire constantly breaks ) they sound a little bass heavy to me now
i now do most of my listening with a pair of grado sr60 is
much better all around but twice as expensive
my first pair cost me about $50 and that was as in 1980 is dollar is
so if you take into account their current price these head phones are a real steal
and remember folks they come with a life time guarantee
the last two times that they stopped working i sent them in
the first time they were repaired
the second time i got a new pair
not bad
but what they should really do is improve the quality of the wire
even if it means an extra $5
i would recommend these to most but not to the very active or to folks who tend to break things , like my daughter
love you honey .
after reading a very positive review of these headphones in computer shopper magazine i decided to buy three for use in my workshops and classes
i like their light weight , compactness , and great sound quality
over time they may not take the abuse some of my students will subject them to
for now i am very pleased with them .
i have had my koss portapro headphones for about eight years now
they have served me well
i purchased them in circuit city ( one of the only local places where one could find them eight years ago ) and they have traveled from ipod to ipod , served in some mild studio work , and have basically been the best set of headphones i have ever had
they sound great , they are comfortable , and they are durable
there is not much more to say
they are starting to wear out just now , and i guess i will be forced to buy a new set from amazon ( or invoke koss' lifetime warranty ) within the next year or two
it is good that they are a bit easier to acquire now , and the price is about right
i am no audiophile , but i do believe most people will find the koss portapro headphones to be superior to just about anything in the same price range .
these headphones are great ! i can not compare their sound quality to those headphones costing $ , because i don not have that sort of cash laying around
what i can say is that these have a very wide range of frequency response , giving clear resolution to both the highest and lowest tones , and good clarity of vocals
they are very light weight , and do not exert much pressure on my ears , or anywhere , making them very comfortable to wear for long periods
and , although built lightly and compactly , they do not appear to be too fragile
they actually do easily fold up and fit inside of the included 4
5&<HASHTAG> ; x 5
5&<HASHTAG> ; drawstring bag , making them highly portable
they are just what i had hoped they would be .
got a couple of these for $25 each and my wife and i use them to watch netflix and such
they are very good for what they are
comfortable : secure without being tight
easy to fold up for protection
open phones make it possible for us to make comments to each other while watching ( not possible with higher quality earbuds we have
) especially if you find them at this price , go for it !
i want to like these headphones
i bought a pair of sportapros and wanted a second pair , tried the portapros as they seemed to get slightly better reviews
now i am wondering - what are people listening to ? the sportapros sound so much better than the portapros that i have to believe something is wrong
no depth or layering or punchiness to the portapros
portas are mostly defined by in the treble range
i am getting sound out of both earpieces so there is not a missing channel
i have heard all about the "" for headphones , but the sporta is haven not needed that and i am not sure how much time to waste on these porta is
i also own a pair of sennheiser hd238 which beat the heck out of the portapros but are somewhat on a par with the sportapros
now the senns seem to be sounding better with more use as i did not like them as well out of the box , but do now
or my ears are getting "" to their sound as i think happens also
is there something wrong with my portapros ? i have no idea why there would be such dramatically poor quality in a product which most people seem to rate higher or on a par with the other phones i have
* update 1/28/11 - another thing with these phones - the channels are reversed ! listening to "all i have gotta do" by the beatles ( old stereo , music one side vocals the other ) i have <NUM> sets of headphones where the vocals are right channel and the music is from the left channel
on these , it is reversed ( and yes i do know how to put them on , triple checked etc )
wth is the deal with these ? * another update - a1 accessories is sending me a replacement pair today even though i have already lost all my original packaging and stuff
so many thanks to them for so far great customer service
i will post on the new ones when they arrive
* update 1/31/11
quick service from a1 accessories to replace my headphones and now the sound is much better
now i can compare these to my other phones and the sound is definitely comparable ( and channels are no longer switched )
i am finding that the firm - light settings are very touchy
they don not want to stay on the "light" setting easily but that is a minor problem
i am now much happier and have changed my stars review to reflect this .
i adore these headphones
they are definitely the best portable/lightweight headphones i have used
amazing frequency response across the entire range
very comfortable , even if you are wearing glasses
the lifetime warranty is a big plus too .
i had a pair of these and broke them then sent for another pair , the replacement pair was not made the same and don not sound as good as my old pair , these are made more cheaply by far and are not near as good as there old model
not even sure writing a review can do these headphones justice , exceptional ; is the first word that comes to mind
these are not just good for the price , they are just good
there is always a satisfying feeling i get when i feel like i received more than i payed for , and that is exactly what i received here
very highly recommended .
excellent product in every way
this product is light , easy to use , comfortable and excellent sound quality
all in all worth the money .
just as lots of others have said here , these are headphones
they are comfortable , and they stay on my head while working out and doing chores that require a lot of repetitive bending , like laundry
but i only bought the pair in nov 2012
now here it is june 2013 , and one side just died completely
i don not have the "paperwork" so the warranty is useless
lesson ? next time , keep the "papers" and register the headset so that if they break again , i have some recourse
also , the price is now about $5 higher than when i bought them last year .
get the sportapros instead
they look better , can be worn in a street configuration , cost less , and sound exactly the same .
these are ugly as sin , but comfortable to wear , and the sound quality is excellent - so much better than the sony is i replaced with these !
for sound quality , you would be hard pressed to find something as good in this price range
true , there is a few products out there ( some senn earbuds come to mind ) but you could spend a lot more and get something that doesn not sound this good
don not expect any isolation though , these are open to the air ( as most of the best sounding headphones are )
for comfort , they are
they are not the worst i have used , but the band isn not particularly comfortable
the design is also prone to catch hairs ( i have short hair so it doesn not bother me so much , but once in a while it catches one and rips it out )
the styling is very 80 is , which , well , makes sense , since they were designed in the 80s
i guess that is good or bad depending on what you like
oh , the &<HASHTAG> ; case&<HASHTAG> ; they come with is useless
you will never get them to fit back in the case
i think the bag itself is physically large enough to contain them , but the opening is not .
i am admittedly a when it comes to sound
i like my klipsch , sennheiser , grados , etc
i dislike bose for the cheap materials , business model
i am annoyed by beats headphones that are just monster headphones with dr
dre is name and bass tones - but sold in awesome bright colors
hey , i respect that beats is bringing attention back to cans , i really do , but they are not good sounding headphones
i have a nice pair of sennheiser headphones i can not always wear due to headaches from the noise cancelling feature
also if i am doing activities , the sennheisers are huge and cumbersome , not practical if i am running , washing my car , or otherwise moving about quickly
i have a great pair of klipsch earbuds , and those are fantastic for running
but they have poor bass response
the koss portapros are fantastic , almost mixing the best of both and leaving out the extras
it does not sound as nice as the either of the above mind you , but you won not be left complaining
the bass response will destroy those of any headphone , but you know that
koss' drivers are more than capable of handling the meager power they receive , and they do well to replicate bass from an design
the downside ? yes , the looks
hey , they are not pastels that scream "look at me ! " in fact , they are ugly and say "stay the hell away from me ! " but if you are not buying headphones for the image ( and you really shouldn not be ) , then you shouldn not care
they look dorky for a reason , though : each side has a switch that allows you to set firmness , allowing the buds to "flex" outward
this makes for very comfortable wearing
so if you are not trying to impress the kids at your high school and instead want to save some money and get good sound , check out the koss portapros
the best part is they are so inexpensive , if they ever do break or get lost , stolen , etc
you don not care
if my brother lost his dres , he'd kill somebody
but my portapros ? it is $25 bucks man
i just go order another
: d
i bought these headphones thinking i was moving up slightly from my koss sportapros
wrong ! they are a half step down in sound quality
specs say they should be at least as good but in reality they have a notinnier' sound .
i ordered these for an upcoming cruise to use on the plane and the ship both
have tried them out on my laptop and for their size they sound great
not as nice as the noise cancelling ones that i keep at my desk at work but then again their not as big and bulky as those either .
don not let the design deter you
these headphones produce excellent sound with good volume , bass and frequency range
for the reasonable price , i don not think you will be disappointed with the sound quality of these headphones
also , they can be compactly stored ( designed to fold together ) and carried within included case
okay , the bad
they are not the most comfortable "" headphones with a pretty tight feel and a bit difficult to adjust
also , the metal/plastic headband slide has grabbed my hair a bit without following through with a kiss
when i first started using headphones ( over <NUM> years ago now ) koss was the brand to get
this still seems to be true today
overall , these are very good sounding headphones for a reasonable price .
these are old school small headphones and are not particularly stylish
ok , they are ugly
that said , the sound is waaaay excellent
get over it
do you want sound better than 'phones costing <NUM> to <NUM> times this much or do you want to be stylish ? at $32 , you have really got to give them a try
don not be misled by a few average ratings , because audiophiles are notoriously inclined to diss everything but their favorites
i have a good music system , plus a high tech computer with an excellent sound card , and these headphones rock on both .
i know these headphones are not as cool as dr
dre is but they have excellent sound and bass
they are comfortable to wear and store easily
highly recommended .
i bought these a the px 100 is and girlfriend pick the px 100 is i got these , i like the style and the sound is a huge step up from the ipod in ear phones
i also dig the warranty that koss gives these
i have to admit the sound is a little more defined on the sennhiesers ( how do you spell it ? ) but the difference is not worth quibbling over
you will be happy with either pair , but the px 100s stay in place on her head better ( ive got a bigger dome ) so if you have a small head go for those .
these koss headphones are well priced and nice audio quality for mp3 quality recordings
not good for noisy environments since they are open style and relatively small but very comfortable for long sessions of use .
if you don not have these headphones then you bought the wrong pair
bose is nice these are nicer
bose cost 299
00 these are under 50
00 and sound better
no they are not noise canceling
yes they are more comfortable
okay so they are the ugly ducklings of headphones but they sound awsome
these are my third pair
i just wear them to death
they rock the head !
this is the 4th pair of these headphones
the connector problem has been fixed andthe sound continue s tobe freat
the 6nit curls up into easily transported ball
i can , t imagine flying withojt them .
fro the price these are hard to beat
i love the retro look and the sound quality will far surpass anything at this price point
lifetime warranty as well .
i have had these headphones for around a year now
they are great sounding and quite durable
they feel kind of cheap but even my <NUM> and <NUM> year old sons couldn not break them ( they break or lose almost everything i get them )
the most outstanding feature of these phones is the smooth and accurate sound you get from them
i use my pair with a zune mp3 player
they blow away the standard ear buds , as well as my monitor headphones and the skull candy headphones i bought
the only complaint i have is the styling
since i am not trying to make a fashion statement , i have to give them <NUM> stars
31 , 2012 : i have owned these headphones for over <NUM> years now and i have to say i love them as much today as when i got them
they have held up quite well with only a small problem developing at the plug end of the cord
where it enters the plug end the rubber has become frayed
i remedied this with my hot glue gun
i was going to send them to koss under the lifetime waranty but didn not feel it was worth the shipping costs
i just bought new cushions because the old ones are quite crushed at this point
everytime i go to the store to sample headphones i come away thinkig these sound as good or better than the ones they have on display
ive tried the sony is , skullcandy is , klipshe , etc
the only ones i like better are the more expensive ( over $200 ) sennheisers , bose , bowers and wilkins , and audio technica
i haven not heard the grado or beyerdynamics headphones so i can not comment on those
for portable use you would be hard pressed to find a better headphone .
the fit is both tight and comfortable ; very usable on pretty much any exercise machine
earbuds aren not an option for me given the weird geometry of my ears , and these are just perfect
the folding design works well in a gym bag , too
plenty of bass , and more than enough volume when driven through my cheap mp3 player
i wouldn not mistake these for my grado sr60s , but they are half the price and much more portable
i had a pair of these in the early '90s , and loved them back then too .
3rd set , what else can i say lol
they have always been a little heavy on the base but as a work horse they are perfect
when i was much younger , like i had a pair of koss headphones that i bought at a local music shop for like $15
i have never had a pair of headhpones i liked that much again
they technically still work , but i broke the connection between the headphone and the head band
i have been using sennheiser 201hd is at work for a few years now
but the bass was never terribly pleasing
i had decided to buy a more expensive set of headphones and was reminded of my old koss headphones over christmas
these things are amazing
the base response blows the sennheisers out of the water ( and yes , i know they are twice as expensive ) the comfort unbelievable
i have even taken them to a local radio shack and they sounded better ( to me ) than the 249
99 beats they had on display
i gotta say , these things rock
frequency response is unbelievable in a cheap pair of headphones like these .
porta pros can be broken easily but mostly is snapped back , audio technica under $ 1oo great too for under $
i recently went though a spate of headphones -- <NUM> pair in this price range
this is by far the best sounding of the group ( by far ! ) and i find myself using them the most often
as a matter of fact , they sound better than my studio headphones ( audio technica ) that cost about $100 more
the only problem i have is that they can get uncomfortable after an hour or two of use , and they stick to your hair
if you have long hair ( anything after a 1950 is crewcut ) they will stick to your hair and pull it when you adjust them and take them off
totally worth it -- great sound and all -- as long as you don not mind the problem with the ouchy hair .
i was reasonably happy with the sound and comfort , but after a year of use , there is a loose connection near the plug that makes one channel cut out
i am really sick and tired of the disposable nature of every pair of headphones i buy .
we have had these headphones for about <NUM> years until the kids finally finished them off when trying them
these headphones are great for using in gym
they designed in the way that the pressure is distributed between your ears and your scull so that they are fixed firmly when you are jogging
the sound quality is simply amazing for their price
the design looks sort of dated but that is because they have been produced without change for more then <NUM> years now
i have bought the same model now to replace the broken once
highly recommend .
no wonder these phones have been around for so long
i was surprised when i heard them
i mean for the money you spend i feel you get more quality sound then not
all ranges sound really good
the low end i felt was really nice to hear
all ranges come out good
about the down side
well , i don not feel i have room to complain
they have a lifetime warrantee
you don not need any ra# , you mail them to koss and they either repair or replace it
this was a large part of my deision in buying these
they have short wires and the wires are thin
would of been nice if they made them with an exrta couple feet of length
you do need care to handle them cuz they seem a bit fragile but so long as you take care they should last
would i recomend them ? yes i would !
reviews are great , sound is great , comfort is awesome you almost can not feel they are there
however , some geek has decided to skip the two different methods of plug , that have worked just fine since plugs were invented
instead of a plug going straight in , or a plug with a <NUM> degree bend , they have decided to be cute and have used a plug that has a <NUM> degree bend
in one great flash of brilliance ( insert sarcasm here ) they have managed to get the bad features of both other plug designs
it sort of sticks out and it is sort of able to follow the line of the player
but not quite
if i keep these , i will be rewiring to a standard plug
bad idea koss ! otherwise great headphone with a great history , now with an odd little glitch .
having recently sold my sony headphones ( good cans but no longer practical for my purposes ) , i succumbed to the frequent hype surrounding the koss portapros and ordered a pair , as a to my sennheiser px100s and , if necessary , as a replacement
they certainly are no replacement , and i have yet to decide whether to keep them as a
headphone judgments can be highly subjective , but here is one consumer is observations : 1
the portapros have a reputation as "" but providing , compensating sound quality
my first impression upon wearing them , even before connecting them to a cd player , was that the comfort level is not equal to the px100s
i was highly conscious of an awkward tin band around my head and frankly baffled by the resistant "comfort zone" switch
admittedly , the initial sense of discomfort dissipated once the sounds of my player were picked up by the headphones
they are indeed high efficiency ( demanding less volume than the px100s ) , producing an open , "" and transparent sound in the and offering impressive detailing of the acoustic double bass on the low end as well as the drummer is ride cymbal on the upper end
i began doing numerous comparisons , noting that the portapros were immediately more arresting , producing bright , "forward" and "instant" reproduction of all frequencies , at times making me wonder if the px100s weren not just a trifle muddy
but soon the portapros began to sound slightly "edgy" and "aggressive"-- less balanced in their overall sound compared to the sennheisers
then an achilles heel became unmistakable on a cd on which the portapros began to break up on the notes of the double bass unless i backed off on the volume by <PERCENT>
with the px100s the same cd produced only the slightest hint of distortion , which vanished when i cut back on the volume by a mere <PERCENT>
soon i wearied of the comparison : the px100s had won the argument , and rather convincingly at that
they are slightly more cumbersome to fold up and reinsert in their hard case than the portapro is ( at least without practice ) , but that slight downside had never seemed more insignificant
neither of the above headphones would be ideal for monitoring or dj work near a microphone , the portapros more so because of their extreme sensitivity , which would certainly invite feedback
for that sort of work , i depend on the largely overlooked koss ur40s
for comfort , frequency range , balance , and wearability i would take these ( but extremely lightweight ) headphones over not only the portapro and px100 but the sony phones mentioned above
the ur40s handled the overly "hot" bass with absolutely no incident or rollback requirement
their weakness is shoddy workmanship ( i am on my 2nd pair ) : the head webbing came detached after a couple of months' use and the conducting wire is both excessively thin and short
( if you purchase either koss , be sure to save all of the order materials to be able to avail yourself of koss' famous lifetime guarantee ) .
bought my first headset by koss ( ktx/pro ) titanium at least 8 , maybe <NUM> years ago
got it at a drugstore for about $15
it finally failed a week ago
not completely , just wore out foam ear covers and developed a spotty wiring problem
i was faced with replacing the best headset a picky , picky audiophile like me could find
i spent a lot of time reading reviews and bought this one
and boy am i a happy camper ! don not waste anymore time
get this headset
rich , deep base , clarity , no distortion of sounds in background
i cannot imagine a headset that could sound better than this one
it is extremely comfortable
the wiring is a lot thinner and i may worry about damaging it
only disappointment was the "case" included
it is not a case but rather a black bag made of a synthetic material
i folded the headset to try to use the bag and stopped
i don not want to cram like crazy and damage the headset to get it in the little bag
i will use the bag for other electronic gadgets
my old reliable koss headset came with a volume control , and this one is missing that dandy feature
that is the only thing it is missing .
i have been using these for about a month now
i have done some traveling , working out , and simple listening at work with the porta pros and i love them so far
the bass is great , the sound quality is wonderful for a tiny portable set of headphones , and they are comfortable on my ears
i would definitely buy another pair .
i have owned these for <NUM> years and they still sound great
lifetime warranty , crisp sound , good base for portables , sturdy , comfortable
get them .
i am disappointed with the sound quality from this headphone
it does output strong bass , but overall sound is muffled
the high is very weak , barely audible
i prefer the koss ksc75 and sennhauser px100 for they both produce a more balanced sound than the portapro .
i find earbuds to be very uncomfortable
these koss portapros were perfect for replacing the earbuds that came with my mp3 player
they are comfortable to wear , have great sound for the price and have a little stylish pizazz
they are easy to fold up and put into a suitcase or purse for travel
i am very happy with my choice .
these have very good sound
relatively comfortable on head
i like being able to hear surrounding sounds , so i appreciate that .
i have two sets of these headphones - one has been my companion in my gym bag for about <NUM> years , and the other has gone traveling with me over many trips in my computer bag as well as used frequently at home
i probably have a dozen pair of good to excellent headphones , including various sennheisers , grado sr 60 , shure , super
fi pro 6 , sony mdr v6 and v300 , etc
honestly these porta pros do not offer the best sound quality in the world
but they might be the most comfortable
and the sound quality is pretty darned good with excellent bass for a headphone so small
they are easy to carry around , and i have found them to be surprisingly durable
by comparison i also have the sennheiser px 100s
the sennheisers are ok , but not as comfortable and the sound is more muffled
i always go back to the porta pros
in fact , no matter what ever headphones i try i always go back to the porta pros
these have been around a long time , but no one has yet made a better portable headset
usually i don not like to jump in with a me too review when there are this many people who have already written a review
but these headphones are that good , and i recommend them to anyone with an ipod or other mp3 player .
yes , i know they have a lifetime warranty
but , i have to pay shipping there , and shipping $6 back
so for a $30 set of headphones i have to pay a third of the cost to get a replacement
that said , great bang for the buck with audio quality
good bass , but clear , not boomy like cheapos
however , the cord frayed within <NUM> months , and i am hearing occasional audio go out
i think the quality of the build is a <NUM> out of 5 , but the audio is <NUM> out of 5
be aware you are getting a cheaply made product that outperforms the price
i am personally going to look to switch over to grado is or something that seems more durable .
sounds good enough , even to a discreet audiophile - at this price point
i use it to listen to itunes on my laptop and it sounds far better than the laptop speakers
it sounds especially decent when listening to jazz , classical music and ballads
dj/dance hall music and the like sounds good too but would sound even better with more bass
the head phones are a very good all rounder
go ahead and get it if you are on a budget .
a relative got this model koss as a gift and absolutely loved them , but finally , the thin cord broke loose , so he purchased another pair and sent them back because the ones being sold now are not the same ones as he got before and are so cheap and flimsily made that he knew they would not last
the cord for one thing is a lot more flimsy and thin and there is more plastic
the photograph is showing the old model koss and does not depict the newer version of this same model which is not made as well and was quite a shock when he got them .
i was looking for a pair of headphones that had great sound quality and that didn not cut out all ambient noise
these delivered in all aspects and won me over with their vintage appeal
the sound is bright , crisp , undistorted and they are also very comfortable while wearing eyeglasses
i was tempted by vintage cans like the sennheiser hd414s but the used prices are a little hard to justify when compared to the koss portapros
the hd414s also need a powerful amp for them to shine and i am just plugging into my mac and ipod most of the time
the koss portapros are the ultimate in retro chic and for the price you'd be to find another set that rivals their sound quality and design .
these headphones are great and it is a &quot ; anybody is choice&quot ;
it is firm and light
solid headbands ( metal )
pros : - is great ! firm , mild , and &quot ; did you see my headphones ? &quot ; - designcons : -cheap cord ( ask me for a pic ) -the plastic on it may seem solid , but drop it once and it breaks ! ( ask me <NUM> pic ) -plug in form of &quot ; v&quot ;
this makes it easy to tear off
( ask pic <NUM> see difference ) -sound slightly above average , but no competition against panasonici really hesitated when i saw it , i knew that it would break
and i was right , a fall of a meter and there is my money flying by
i highly recommend to people who are careful and one last tip , fold the headphones so that it doesn not break ! don not fear breaking it by folding the phones close to the metal bands and bending the thing like a metal bar
i like the design , but i wished that the body was metal only , not plastic ! the three stars missing are for the bad cord
it is cheap
you are supposed to be careful and not dropping it once and it is over
otherwise it is a must buy !
i have been through so many headphones , and many have sounded fine ( such as this set ) ; however , what is the point of having a decent sound when the construction itself doesn not last more than a year ? honestly , i think i am done buying sets with their fragile construction
and by this , i mean that ( in <PERCENT> of the broken cans i have had ) it is the wire connection to the plug
what bothered me the most about this set was that i never really used it in any aggressive manner
it is just time and movement of any kind has weakened that connection
it shouldn not be the case
regardless , i am late to the game on reviewing this product , so i don not expect to change anyone is minds
if you are in the market for a cheaply made but decent sounding set of headphones to get you through a period , this might be recommended
for my part , i think it is time to spend more and shoot higher .
i came to these headphones after coming from $180 shure e210 earbuds that broke and these headphones are certainly on par , if not better , than them
i loved my shure earbuds and i love these a heck of a lot more
the sound quality is superb and while there have been complaints about the bass for some , it is definitely not a deal breaker
personally , i appreciate the little extra bass these give
it is not overwhelming , but it is noticeable that these headphones have more bass than others
there are two major things that people may be concerned with with this product : 1 ) the adjusters at the top of the band catch a few hairs on your head and may pull a few out as they are being removed
having short hair is beneficial with these headphones , but if you have long hair , simply hold the adjusters in place as you remove them and remove them gently
you will have no problems otherwise
2 ) these headphones leak sound just like any other headphone of this type
if this bothers you , you may want to look elsewhere
the sound leakage isn not super loud or annoying , but if you are in a quiet room and listening to rock music at a moderate level , a person a few feet from you will notice you are listening to music
otherwise , the sound , the comfort , and the price makes these headphones worth it for anyone who is looking for a great pair of headphones
they easily stand up to headphones within the $150-$200 price range and sound just as good for a fraction of the price
no , these are not too good to be true
you won not be disappointed .
i have had two pair of these
lost the first pair and replaced them
light weight and great sounding and easy to store with a life time replacement warranty
you just can not go wrong .
these headphones are an amazing value and very well designed
the headphones are small , yet the design is such that they firmly yet comfortably fit on your head
there is a small button allowing adjustment of how much pressure is exerted
the drivers are nicely padded and there are pads that sit on the temple , ensuring that the drivers sit parallel to the ears
the sound is superb , especially considering the size of the phones
the bass extension is very good and satisfying , much better than comparably sized phones
the overall sound is neutral and so that you can listen to them for hours at a time without getting tired
one thing to note is that headphones typically are "open" or "closed" design
a closed design uses heavy pads to block out external noise and are meant for use in noisy environments
open headphones , like the koss portapros , are designed for use in quiet environments
so if you want phones for use in the subway or the airplane , these are not designed for that type of use
another very important feature of koss phones is the lifetime warranty
i have had my koss portapros for over <NUM> years now
i have accidently snagged the wires and ripped one out
i sent them back to koss with a check to cover the nominal shipping and handling charge ( see their website for details ) , and they promptly refurbished my headphones , and even put on new pads to replace my old pads ! other manufaturers would have forced me to buy a new pair of phones
so if you expect your phones to take some punishment during use , the lifetime warranty is a big plus
those interested in small , open style phones may also want to check out the sennheiser px100 , which delivers similar performance , though the px100 has less prominent bass and more ; the typical sennheiser sound
both are excellent values but in my mind , the extra bass output and lifetime warranty make the koss phones a slightly better deal .
i have been modding and testing headphones out for the past <NUM> years and these are my favorite
they can be used for any genre you can think of
excellent sound all around and they aren not even burned in yet
highly recommended for comfort and sound ! update : i am returning these unfortunately
although they are great , they are not so good for exercising
i didn not even attempt it but if you get sweat inside the ear cushions , it will go straight to the driver
they are great for portable use still as well
they also were a little tight on my head , even with the light mode on
the light mode also wasn not working very well
i have a bigger than normal sized head though
if you have a normal or small head , these would fit great
it just clamped too hard for me
while i still recommend them , they are just made way too cheaply and hurt my head .
bought these to replace a pair that gave up the ghost after <NUM> years
best investment then , and now
a classic like this should never die
hopefully they never will .
when i lived in sweden , about <PERCENT> of the population had these headphones
they were extremely popular
now i know why ! the sound quality on these things is amazing , comparable to $50+ headphones
the only headphones i have listened to so far that have better sound quality are some more expensive sennheiser headsets
the bass is really booming , and there is crisp treble and pretty nice midrange
they are extremely portable too
i can fit them in the pockets of my shorts when folded up
pretty durable cable too , and it doesn not twist
i highly recommend these !
fair sound , great price , and the collapsed form factor makes them quite transportable
will update this review in a few months after seeing how they hold up .
they been making these the same way since before i was born and they haven not changed a thing
after years of loyal service i finally abused my pair to death and i wouldn not order any other headphones to replace them
they are lightweight and i often forget i am wearing them
they do great bass simulation and i can hear instruments i can not detect on other headphones
there are some downsides too but none of them are dealbreakers
it has a weak size adjusting slider that can snag your hair and the dated 80 is design is kinda ugly
they have no noise cancellation , so sound will start to leak before my ipod reaches half volume , and for something called the porta pro , they aren not particularly portable
they fold up , but they don not fit in your pocket
still , you can not find a better lightweight pair of headphones in this price range
they work great and except for the occasional hair snag , they are comfy , but best of all they won not break the bank to deliver a quality sound
take the pepsi challenge and compare them to other headsets
you will see there is a reason they have earned a cult following .
take what other reviewers have said about these headphones , believe them , and then multiply it by 100
i received a pair of koss as a gift years ago and loved them so naturally i looked to koss again when replacing my portable/ headphones
after buying a pair of , which sounded great but were uncomfortable for me personally , i hopped on amazon and found everyone raving about the portapros
i figured they were good , especially considering that the design seems unchanged since the 1980s ( which has to mean something ) , but i also figured that this was one of those things that was just too good to be true
however , these are the most amazing headphones i have ever put on my head
listening to some of my favorite songs for the first time was one of those 'wow' moments where you realize you have found something that changes your expectations completely
the bar will be raised the instant you hear the bass response and incredible acoustic qualities of these light , comfortable headphones
i don not know what i am impressed with the most : the amazing bass , the excellent stereo division , or how loud they can get ! these things are just as amazing as most of the reviews show them to be and then a lot more
i was worried about the eighties styling , but in person they don not look bad at all
i hate headphones that scream for attention , but these don not look like that when you have them on and i have already been wearing them in public ( something i didn not think i would do after only seeing the picture of them online )
and even if they are a bit outdated in appearance , the design is so functional you won not even give looks a second thought after you put them on
one thing is for sure : these things have plenty of bass ! not too much ( not "boomy" ) , but they seem properly tuned for listening to things without "bass booster" turned on , which i like
even with the bass settings adjusted high , the bass remains clear and crisp
i am not sure how much power these can handle without damaging them , but i listen to them very loud and they do not sound distorted or stressed at all
after a few days my left speaker began making some weird noises and it ended up being a hair stuck inside the headphones that i cleared out with canned air
something important to consider is that these are very open and airy headphones and the treble carries very well outside the headphones ( so someone nearby could definitely hear what you are listening to if you have the volume up loud )
others have mentioned that they felt the headphones were too tight feeling , but i have a very large head and they fit me without a problem
however , if i will be wearing them for an extended period of time i always set them to the "light" setting on the comfortzone control ( which divides the side pressure of the headphones with your temples rather than just on your ears )
i already had headphones i was pleased with ( sony and koss ) but i wanted a set of small , portable headphones for use with my laptop and these are perfect
the folding design isn not something i necessarily wanted , but it is nice
the carrying case they come with ( a leatherette bag ) is a slightly tight fit and i probably won not end up using it much since it is not a hard case that would protect them from shock or crushing
some others have mentioned that they feel delicate or are easily broken , but compared to other small headphones i have had they seem very well built and equally strong considering their light weight
while i wouldn not say these are bad things about the portapros , it is worth mentioning that the headband is metal and will occasionally snag a hair as you adjust it on your head , and that they don not fold down as small as you might think they would so don not expect to put them in your pants pocket or something
considering these are the worst things i can come up with to say about the portapros , they are nearly perfect in my book
i can not say enough good things about these portapros ! they are simply amazing
these are the first headphones ( or speakers ) i have had that sound absolutely awesome without adjusting the equalizer or pumping up the bass
they sound good on everything from r&amp ; b to country and everything
i have been especially impressed that they pull the bass and highs out of a song without getting that shrill , tinny treble that plagues so many headphones
if there ever was a question about the quality of koss stereophones in my mind , these portapros have put it to rest and made me into a lifetime customer ! if you are like me you will wish you had discovered these legendary headphones ( haha ! how often is that said ? ) years ago .
my family is hard on headphones
this is the only pair of headphones of any type in my household that has made it six months
the koss portapros are comfortable and have a very transparent sound
highly recommended .
these may be a throwback to the seventies , but the sound is great
the only concern you might have is that they don not block out much outside sound and , since the cups are open , they allow those around you to hear what you are listening to if you really have it cranked up
i wanted good headphones that we over/on ear with good balance of sound at a reasonable price and these headphones worked out perfect
i got these to listen to music and podcasts and found these handle the full range with out being too compared to dre beats or other headphones
i have found that many headphones bill themselves as such because they can produce a lot of bass , but end up sacrificing range and clarity
i wanted a pair of good headphones and were looking at some sets that were &<HASHTAG> ; $150 and decided to take a shot at these
these work for all types of music which i have tried classical , , rock and roll , and dub step
i used them at work and a couple of times at the gym with no issues in either arena
they will block out the background noise of the gym and the pads don not soak up sweat like other headphones i have ruined in the past
two issues are the looks and the comfort
the looks are something you will get used to
i have found that these can get uncomfortable after wearing these for a couple of hoursprogreat soundgreat bassgreat rangegreat priceconlookscomfort
i bought these headphones after my koss earbuds finally developed a short after many years of use
i stayed with koss because i had been very satisfied with these earbuds as a significant improvement over the apple earbuds for an ipod
and i was hoping for a bit of an upgrade with these headphones
but i didn not expect this significant an upgrade
when i first listened to them i was a bit overwhelmed by the bass
i had some concerns with an overly heavy bass because of some reviews mentioned this
but the more i listened , the more i loved it
i was simply hearing the bass in a way i had been missing with my earbuds
and i mostly listen to jazz with these headphones so it is not like i am looking for a heavy rock bass here
i was just very happy to hear the bass as well defined as it was with these headphones ( right now gary smulyan is baritone sax sounds amazingly full ! )
and the rest of the sound is excellent as well
my only regret now is i am getting used to this much bigger sound so i am less blown away by what i am hearing than when i first made the upgrade
but i have only to listen to some earbuds to get that &<HASHTAG> ; wow ! &<HASHTAG> ; feeling again
another feature which attracted me to these headphones which didn not dissapoint is their portability
i like to take my earbuds/headhones with me when i travel and don not want to lug big headhones around which take up a lot of space
these headphones fold up into a kind of ball which almost fits in the palm of my hand
and they are very comfortable to wear
the &<HASHTAG> ; comfort zone&<HASHTAG> ; settings come in very handy
moving the setting from &<HASHTAG> ; firm&<HASHTAG> ; to &<HASHTAG> ; light&<HASHTAG> ; makes a difference you can easily notice in how the headphones feel
i find that i prefer the setting right between the extremes ( there are three settings in all )
so , unless you have got something against '80s style and are concerned that you are just going to look too wierd with these things on , they are the perfect listening device to use with an ipod ( or , at least , that is what i use them with ) that combines great sound and portability .
yep , it is old style that is back ! these are the best sound quality reproduction , lightest , easy on the ears headphones i have ever purchased
great for the laptop , mp3 player , stereo system or your tv
koss has not changed a thing in over what <NUM> years i think and now i know why
they work great ! check this out
my <NUM> y
was shocked at the quality he didn not want to give them back to me
haha !
still love the porta pros , which play in the much more expensive leagues when it comes to sound
koss really nailed it with the porta pros , which are much more valued in europe , i found out from a friend
excellent warm sound , a bit bassy but not enough to ruin the experience , not at all .
i bought this from amazon specifically for my twenty hour airline journey
most of my music i hear is lossless format on ipod ( converted from cd using eac software )
i am a guitarist and musician and use various studio monitors and get very easily disappointed by bad quality
i am very impressed by the tightness of the sound coming out of the headphones
the bass is well defined
the headphones are very comfortable to wear and for a guy with a shaven head thats an important criteria as well : - ) i will definitely recommend these headphones to friends
lastly the price just blew me away ! koss could have charged much higher than this but someone out there is a music jedi : - ) may the force be with koss .
sound is
price is great
a little fragile , but take care and it will give you a light weight headset with full sound .
i bought these two months ago after reading all the rave reviews and was not dissapointed
i am amazed that portapro are just $30
i own a pair of phones that costed me more than double the price , and a pair of seinnheiser pmx60
i can safely say that portapro are far superior sounding than the other two
the best part is their bass
mids and highs are great as well
pretty comfortable to wear
the only thing i am not a big fan of is their 80 is look
but headphones are for listening , so i am over the looks
highly recommended .
i was a little skeptical at first because these are cheap ( paid about $40 ) and the design is a little different , but wow
the sound is phenomenal
i make my friends that have the "beats" and "soul" studio headphones ( who also paid $200-$400 ) listen and they are jealous of the huge sound ! unless you just want to blow your $$ on those to get a rapper is brand name , get these ! summary : pros : -huge soundstage-- great bass , but not overpowering
good clarity in mids and the highs can sparkle if you want them to , even with bass ! brings music to life--hear it like never before
-interesting design , get lots of questions/compliments
-price -- are you kidding me , $40 for this high quality ? thanks koss ! -comes with decent case and headphones are collapsible to easily carry in a backpack or pocket even
cons : -cord seems a little short , but not bad
about <NUM> feet
i am used to longer cords on studio headphones
-keep in mind these are "on ear" therefore let outside noise in a little
also keep in mind you can turn these up really loud
highly recommend these little headphones
if you are in the market for anything under $400 , get these !
ok here goes
i won not waste much time on the looks as you pretty much see what you get which resembles a $15 set of phones from the 80s
i am ok with the looks if the quality is on mark
overall these look pretty cheesey as the cords as well as the plastics are very thin
i worry about the plug coming apart
the sound is good and has nice bass response
mids and highs are not over done as i like quality bass over cymbals thrashing etc , and it has a warm and acurate tone overall which i like
the fit is good and is adjustable , but tends to want to reset if you use the"light"pressure setting unless you take them off just right
they do fold up very well though
the chance of grabbing your hair is real though not a big deal
overall they have a comfortable fit
these do little to hold outside noise out or music in , so others can hear your music and you can hear them , which is ok as i expected this from the design
i wanted to write a review as almost all reviews praise these to status in this price range
they are very good and yes they get better after a
for this money they should be on your short list
it appears people have luck with these lasting for years and are a product really worth the price for once
update 07/2012holding up and sounding great !
i got these because the low price , good sound quality and they are collapsable
they do all those , they were a good price and good sound but man these are very uncomfortable
they pinch at the eyes and my hair would be caught in them all the time
i stopped using them all together and now they just collect dust .
i was due for a new set of headphones , and as i despise earbuds , i searched carefully , and found these superb phones from koss
they are not expensive , yet if you are particular about your music , your ears will hear sounds other headphones could not reproduce
i can wear these all day and they are not so large you look like a relic from the 70 is
they fold closed and come with a bag
the bass is clear and not muddy , the highs are clean and not painful to the ear
this model has been in production continiously since <NUM> without change ! koss hit it right with these !
i had a pair years ago and lost them
if you want a solid pair of headphones that sound excellent these are the headphones for you
i can not believe how many have bought into the beats headphone hype
with their muddy bass and sound decay at high volumes
save your money on most headphones selling in the $300
00 range , koss sound just as good if not better
the only issue , what is up with the mini case ? it is a - - - - getting those phones into that little bitty koss bag , make the case larger .
i have owned a lot of headphones over the years , and i have never found any reasonably priced headphones that approach the sound quality that these have
yes , they aren not exactly stylish - the design dates from the 1980s and it shows
but there is a reason why they are still for sale after all these years
you don not survive in a business as competitive as consumer electronics for all this time unless there is a reason for it
they aren not perfect for all occasions - i wouldn not go running with them because the foam pads would eventually get sweaty and nasty
you could use them on a plane , but they don not have any /noise cancelling features and they don not isolate your ears
but for like commuting on the subway , at work or to watch movies on your laptop after your wife is asleep , they are perfect
good base response , but nicely balanced throughout
crisp , not muddy at all
they hold up well if you don not abuse them , i had a pair years ago and they lasted a long , long time .
i am most certainly not an audiophile but these headphones came highly recommended not only from other sites but from other people i know
they are a classic design from the eighties which is now nouveau chic again
i am a heavy heavy tech user and like to use high quality items and i demand a lot from them
with that said these are my new favorite headphones ( the one is that travel with me everywhere )
i was skeptical even after reading all the reviews , thinking "how could something so reasonably priced really be as good as all of these reviews suggest
" well they can be and are , consider my doubts banished as i was pleasantly surprised
the reviews are correct , this is koss' masterpiece , homerun , the epitome of what koss represents
i have a pair of bose triport headphones and senneheiser px200 is both of which are excellent headphones
and these porta pros are commandingly better ( the triports are "warmer" and the senneheisers crisper , but i like the sound of these best as they are the cleanest clearest balance of warmth & crispness )
they are light weight , foldable , exceptionally comfortable and of coarse the sound quality is excellent
actually , i cannot say enough about the sound quality , it is well balanced , full , hits the highs , lows and everything in between accurately
they produce clean scratch that pristine audio that is a pleasure to listen to
i find myself searching out music that can challenge or push these and they just keep on producing beautiful music to my ears
essentially they are awesome
( period ) they sound and function better than headphones easily two or three times their price , look cool if you are into retro and they are dirt cheap
concerns : the only concerns if any are that the part that connects the earpiece to the headphone part doesn not seem very robust and may break eventually ( though i haven not had any issues )
some may find that the metal headband might catch on their hair ( something else i haven not had an issue with , though i have short hair ) and finally , the foam pads over the earphones sort of scream i am cheap and i will wear out on you
in defense of them , it does keep with the whole retro thing , it is really comfortable , it is easily replaceable , and they are in fact inexpensive , essentially who cares
many of these small things have been ever so slightly adjusted on the anniversary edition of these gorgeous nearly perfect headphones ( but for twice the price i wouldn not bother )
oh and koss has an included lifetime warranty for the life of the product , ridiculous ! ( amazing ) for me this tosses basically all of the concerns out the window
conclusion : -beautiful design and function ( form and function married beautifully , just one of those products that is right on , balanced , perfect in most ways ) clearly the designers got it and knew what they were doing when they made these
-koss' famous lifetime warranty
-worth every penny , i would feel good about paying twice the price and wouldn not bat an eye
awesome part is you don not have to
i would buy them again , for myself or others .
four star sound quality for under $50
very comfortable , with solid construction
the review on cnet
com is spot on
i could not be more pleased with this purchase .
title of this review pretty much sums it up
the bass is a bit too heavy , for my liking
however , the overall quality is very good
my son took a listen and he loved them
he and his sister have a birthday coming up , so i think i will pick up a couple pair
good value for the money .
i have been using these for many years , mostly for playing music during workouts
i am a fan of really high end headphones ( sennheiser 595s ) and , although my koss phones aren not quite up there with them , they really do satisfy
great bass , great presence and you could run over them with a car and they'd still work
when i bought these ( more than ten years ago ) the dealer ( whom i trusted ) said "these are the best
" he was absolutely right
by the way , i recently listened to the headphones currently marketed as koss porta pros
happily , koss hasn not changed a thing
tom hurley
sound is good overall but these don not wear well
miniplug connector shorts out and earpads keep popping out of their cheap plastic plates .
i am a headphone nut and have $600 worth of headphones lying around ( three pair )
i also have a pair of koss portapro2s , which are identical to the portapro other than lacking part of the adjustment mechanism
despite all this high end audio goodness around , i still use and enjoy the portapros
they offer maybe <PERCENT> of what my other headphones have , for 1/5th the price ( and are much more portable , of course )
i have owned and enjoyed several pair over the years including the radio shack iterations , and have always been wowed by the sound quality
they were my introduction to "better than stock earbud" sound
i think they would be a better deal at $20-$25 , but they are still worth the money at close to $50
the bass can get a bit overbearing at times ( i am no basshead ) , but otherwise they are excellent
also , note that they are completely open , and perhaps not the best choice for noisy environments like on a plane or bus .
i gave it <NUM> stars because for the price , these are about the best headphones you can get sans a good sale
i recommend it to anyone who wants a great pair of headphones you don not need an amp with .
sound is great for such an extremely lightweight headphone ; construction durability remains to be seen
very / portable
wear procedure - bit of a nuisance : because of the thin , spring headband , you must spread out the earpieces all the way ( you can not just slip them over your head and ears ) ; wear the headset ; and then tighten the head band and the comfort buttons to get a good fit
great $ value with koss' lifetime replacement warranty
appeared flimsy on first blush , but on the other hand , it is very flexible and should survive most abuse
however as mentioned in other reviews , the cable insertion points at the ear pieces do appear and should have which is present at the of the cable ( note for koss ) .
a headphone like this is something that will change the way you hear music
the full , bold , clear sound it produces is heavenly
i have been hearing all my old favorites , songs which i have heard thousands of times , and in many of them i notice sounds and instruments i never picked up , not in my jbl speakers , not in my old crappy dell speakers , not in any of the other various headphones i have owned
it is very comfortable to use , very adjustable ( it has adjustments on both arc length and speaker angle ) and looks durable too , even with all the folding it needs to perform to fit in the small bag it came with .
i have been looking for good moderately priced headphones for some time
koss offers a an excellent product
you can not go wrong with this purchase
great bass , highly enjoyable sound
sounds a little heavy but still very listenable
please replace those ear buds and enjoy great music
highly recommended .
these headphones sound great and the price can not be beat
i use them frequently
i did not give them <NUM> stars because they can get a bit uncomfortable after extended use ( 2+ hours ) and they do very little to block the sound from being heard by anyone close by .
i first tried these headphones in the base exchange while i was stationed in germany during my tour in the service
i compared them to a dozen brands they had , including full ear "professional" sets like akg and sennheiser
as mentioned previously , these have the most incredibly tight and full bass
the tweeters put out crisp , clear highs -- especially brass
i bought them on the spot and wore them daily until one day i accidentally pulled the wire out of the phones
i sent it back to the factory with $5
00 shipping and had them back , good as new in less than <NUM> weeks
the earphone mounting design , while comfortable , is not very sturdy
the earpieces snap into the headset and have a central pivot point which is made of plastic of course
well , i broke that piece and the earpiece would not stay on the headset so i sent them to the factory with $5
00 and they fixed them again and shipped them back quickly , good as new
bottom line , when koss says "lifetime warranty"
they mean it
i still have them , actually i am on my third set now and if these wear out , i will buy them again
oh , and did i mention they sound great too !
you know how noisy the nyc subway is ? this product is totally amazing block out the noise but still can hear the announcement
nice deep base too .
koss portapro is light and sounds very good but not spetacular , of course you do not expect it to be at the price
a great value .
product arrived as scheduled and nicely packaged
had my doubts with the koss brand as i never believed it was a premier brand
the sound is very nice and balanced
good bass and not overwhelming
the design is a little outdated but i grew up in the 80 is so it is fine with me
in fact used the headphones to watch one of the cult classics , fast times at ridgemont high on amazon instant video
good bang for your buck and definitely a true value .
i have had many sub-$100 headphones from $5 panasonic to $100 sony , with sennheiser hd 433 , 202 , px100 ii ( i really wanted to like these , they were so very well designed ) , and even a grado sr60 for awhile
and what it basically comes down to is value
i have never heard sound as good as these headphones in the $35 range , easily the best under $75
i can not believe they are over <NUM> years old
it is hard to describe how much detail these headphones bring out without making it too harsh or dull
i listen to every type of music from classical to hip hop to electronic to country , and these headphones are suitable for all types of music
the only fault in the sound is the bass
it is just a *slight* bit boomy , but you get to like it after a while to be honest
the design is from the 80s as you all have probably figured out
it could use a update but it seems like koss has tried to perfect this formula and failed in the past
i don not really care about the looks or the way it folds up or the fact that my hair gets caught up in it ( i have very short hair , even for a male )
but despite it is design flaws , it is the most comfortable headphones i have ever worn , and the best part is that it is also the best sounding pair of headphones i have ever heard under $75
if you can get over the design flaws or if sound is the most important feature of headphones for you , there is nothing even close to this at this price range
this one is an absolute gem
i loved these so much i ordered two of the 25th anniversary ones for a bit more
update : i read some reviews about the being much improved and better sounding than the portapro
since the is relatively new , i thought i'd give it another listen
this time i noticed something different
the sound is warm , mellow , and neutral , but it loses a lot of detail at the expense of these attributes
i still prefer portapro , but some may prefer the more mellow sound of the
oh by the way the portapro comes in the straight plug now , not the angled plug anymore
it is supposed to be for better compatibility with the ipods and iphones out there .
based on all the reviews i thought this was going to be a nice set of cans
unfortunately i am very disappointed
i am comparing them to the sony , which in my opinion rates against headphones in the $200+ price range
the portapro is not a bad headphone , but its not a good headphone either
the bass is present but muddy
not clear or crisp at all
the mids have a decent amount of detail but the muddy bass bleeds the mids out quite a bit
and the treble
where is it ? i haven not heard a headphone with less treble
this lack of treble futher leads to the overall lack of detail and excitement found in other headphones
are they worth the $25 that i paid ? yes
but i wouldn not pay more than that for them
save up and buy the ~$67 sony , its several tiers above the portapro , not only in sound quality , but in noise isolation and build quality
if you can afford the sennheiser hd598 , i also very very highly recommend them as well .
happy with koss portapro
light , comfortable , adjusts easily , great sound quality , while allowing to hear a phone next room ringing
what porta name has to do with it , beats me
not sure what to do with the little bag enclosed , or the fatter adaptor bushing that came with it , but a nice touch
happy ears .
my old sennheiser were finally dying after about five years and it was time to find a new pair of jogging/traveling around headphones
the were great , but with the success of that product sennheiser changed the headphones somewhat and jacked up the price so i figured it was time to tryout their koss counterparts
i am a big fan of the portapros , they have punchy bass , is good and the treble is not too piercing
the result is a very good product , though i have to admit i don not like the sound quite as much as the sennheisers
i think that the main problem is the bass , it is good , but the sennheisers had a dynamic , fat bass sound that the portapros can not quite reach
i am a fan of a variety of music , and in rock and jazz tunes this slight deficiency is not apparent at all
with electronic music and , in particular , , the limits of the bass show up
i should say that i do have perhaps an for sounds so it is possible that you will like the fact that the bass isn not as strong with the portapros
i will also say that while i don not like these portapros quite as much as the , i don not think that the are worth their new $50 price tag and i would purchase these koss headphones again if giving the choice .
for the price , these sound great and are comfortable
i can wear them for hours without problems
the bass is surprisingly decent for those few songs that need it
i like the open ear design for use at work as i can hear when people are talking to me
the whole package is much smaller than it seems in the pictures with the ear pads just barely covering my ears
my biggest complaint is with the portability , or rather the compromises made for that portability
they fold up decently small and very easily
this ease means that all adjustments that you make are immediately reset when you take the headphones off your head , even for a second
since i use these at work , i just keep them at my desk and don not need them to fold up
i'd rather that they didn not so i could adjust them exactly how i want and never have to bother again
edit october 2013 : i have had these since july <NUM> and they still sound great , but i have run into a few issues
-they tend to unfold in my bag if i take them with me
not a big deal , but it tends to tangle the cord when that happens
-the plastic pieces that hold the two halves of the metal headband together started to unsnap and fall apart
it was annoying to keep putting them back together , but some superglue has fixed the problem
-after 1
5 years , the cushions have fallen apart
they are pretty thin to begin with , so no real surprise , and replacements are under $5 for three pairs , but kind annoying
still , i'd buy another pair if i had to
maybe a version .
i have had these for about six months now and gotta say that they are great value for money
i listen to death metal , classical , jazz , classic rock , trance ,
and these do all of them justice
guitars don not sound muddy , bass is punchy ( could be a bit bass heavy for some ) and highs are not screechy at all
the thing is , the design hasn not changed a whole lot since the 80s when they were first introduced
they are headphones , meaning that they leak sound
both ways
so don not wear these on a subway or in a loud area , as they do not block out sound at all
the adjusting mechanism hasn not affected my hair as much as others here , but it is still an issue
extend the phones beyond your head size , then adjust down
this way your hair won not get pulled out as often
the cord is pretty thin and the plastic construction means that you gotta be pretty careful with them ; i have knocked them around a bit in my jacket pockets and backpack though and haven not had any problems
with regards to comfort , i wear glasses , and many other headphones press my ears to my head so hard that my glasses indent the sides of my face
not comfortable at all
these , thanks to those comfort pads above the &<HASHTAG> ; ear&<HASHTAG> ; pads , don not
other headphones tend to make my ears heat up
not these
overall , a great pair for the price , and the portability just makes them that much better
5/5 .
i agree with those who say the look is retro , but i have to say the sound is fantastic , especially for $30
! i compared it to my full size sennheiser which cost considerably more and the sound was great
when playing various styles of music you will find it does sound better on pop/rock/country music compared to classical music , but it was no slouch on the classical side
it really brought my laptop to life , whether it was music or a movie
i would suggest you carefully put it on to avoid pulling on your hair , but that wasn not too diffucult
my son tried it and he wanted to trade the sony is i gave him , i told him he was out of luck !
this sound much better than sennheiser px <NUM> ( owned for about <NUM> years )
it is comfortable on me but i just don not like style
px100 look better .
i bought this as a gift , so the largely negative feedback was really disheartening : *it sounds worse than cheap $ total crap earbuds*it looks so futuristic*it snags hair*it takes quite a bit of force to pull them apart for putting on head*the same tightness that makes keep squishing together and inhibiting easy donning of them puts some unnecessarily pressure on the head and negatively impacts comfort
they are getting used
so used , when i asked to borrow them to verify sound issues or find some resolution to the issues mentioned , they have not been produced so i can assess what is up
if they sounded that bad and were that annoying , then i would have handed them to me for a return the first week
she hasn not even managed to give them to me to check them out and now i can not return through amazon .
the sound from these headphones is top of the line , its a pleasure to listen to my music with these phones
they are light on the head and stay that way using them for extended amounts of time
dislikes ; i don not like having to adjust them each time i put on my head but you soon forget doing the adjustment soon as the music starts
the cable is a little short for me but works
i would recommend these phones but you have to be gentle with them especially with the connector .
i have owned many different headphones before , including asony monitor series headphones with ccaw voice coil ( an incredible headset in its own right ) and listened to some high end sets that friends have including a set of akg k701 studio headphones , and these are , easily , my favorite
i will always love my sony , but due to a recent change in my listening needs , i needed a pair of open cans , portability being a huge plus
i considered the grado prestige series sr80i stereo headphone but those didn not really look very comfortable , and aren not particularly portable
i gave these a shot , and considering their price and heritage , why the heck not ? i have absolutely nothing but praise to say for these cans
they are amazingly comfortable , probably the most comfortable set of cans i own
the comfortzone system really works , and allows you to balance pressure between the ear pads and head pads
why koss or another company hasn not implemented this system in newer sets is beyond me , it allows you to releive the pressure on your ears when your just kicking back and listening , or increase the pressure when you are moving around
of course , these aren not sport phones and are less than optimal when you are very active , for that i would recommend the less comfortable but acoustically similarkoss ksc75 portable stereophone headphones
i haven not found the headband to be uncomfortable at all , but i do have quite the thick dome of hair protecting it
you might think this would cause the hair pinching problem some have complained about , but i haven not had that problem yet
the portability is respectable , they do fold up into , as someone says , a pokey baseball
the case is pretty worthless and too small , but whatever , its really not necessary
the looks , well , are subjective
i think they are very unique and in a way personify the anti-"beats by dr
dre" look , which in my book is a great thing , but most normal people might not agree
who cares what they think : ) and of course , the most important aspect , the sound quality
i find these sound absolutely excellent
the response is geared more towards listening pleasure and not flat response , so these won not be any good at studio monitoring or mixing , but they also don not need a ton of eq adjustments to make listening enjoyable , unlike my is
personally i only bring up the extreme lows and highs just a little bit , and they sound great like that
very detailed , bright , punchy , and excellent response across the entire spectrum , except for the extremely low end of the spectrum
to get solid response in the region , you are probably going to have to find a closed set or a set with larger drivers
it just comes down to the limitations of physics at that point
other than that , the sound is amazing , there is really nothing else to say
just make sure to give them a good long period
a word of warning i should mention , is not all of them come from the factory in perfect working condition
the first set i had poor bass in the left channel , in about the range
this is one of those defects that is hard to detect since bass isn not directional , and for awhile i though maybe i was going crazy
i was able to isolate this by listening to each side individually ( by pulling the other away from my head ) and was able to deduce the problem with the left channel perfectly using that method
amazon was great about the replacement , and my new set is perfect
my only criticism about these cans would be the way koss packs them
they wrap the chord up so tight i doubt the kinks will ever fully come out
i observed the same quirk with the , koss needs to either start wrapping the chords less tight or use a more pliable rubber in the chords
this annoyance is really the only indicator of how affordable these really are
replacing the chords with a better quality set would probably be a worthwhile mod , and one i am considering doing
then again , that would probably void the excellent lifetime warranty
overall , these are an amazing set of cans
there really is no excuse whatsoever not to give them a try ; they have been made the same way for over <NUM> years , and once you use them , you realize why they shouldn not ever change a thing
they are a true legend , and even if the price was double what it is , they would still easily be worth the money
recommended without any reservation whatsoever
oh and a note about the photos , the actual plug is a straight plug , unlike the steel plug in the picture
the 1/8" to 1/4" adapter is entirely as well .
i needed a replacement for broken ksc75 and decided to try these
i didn not find portpro very comfortable , they press against ears a bit too hard for my taste , so i couldn not wear them for too long
but ! the drivers can be easily detached and attached to ksc75 is clips ! this combination turned out to be very comfortable
why not just buy cheaper ksc75 then ? well , the sound of portapro drivers is a step up
unlike some other reviewers state , as far as i can tell , the portapro drivers are the same as ksc35 and not ksc75
they do sound different ( to my ear ) , with portapro/ksc35 being more detailed and crisp but still retaining rich , warm , bassy ( is there such a word ? ) sound i like so much about ksc75
you may also consider ksc35 which is basically portapro drivers with instead of headband ( as far as i can tell koss only sells them directly from their website ) .
bought my wife is pair in sept
they are still great
bought a pair for me in october 2013 , and they are trash
koss changed the molded connector from a right angle stereo mini plug to a straight one
the wire insulation separated just outside the molded strain relief
if yours arrives with a straight connector , send it back
we are very easy on there
use them to listen to ipads in bed
that is it
very disappointed with new production
so i read that koss has a warranty ; just send them in with $9 ! $9 for return shipping ? that covers the total production cost including return shipping
the connector overmolding is no better than a $1 set of ear buds from epay
i am replacing them with sennheiser px
thanks gizmodo .
amazing sound at an amazing price
they are more bass heavy than the ksc75
together they compliment each other very well !
i have been listening to headphones over the past <NUM> years or more
from akg , sony , b and o , bose , senheiser and among others ( such as the overpriced beats by dr
dre ) after listening to earbuds i have found that the sonic quality , price and comfort cannot be beat at this price point
for less than $50 including shipping these headphones are a dream to listen to
with the adjustable temple force you cannot get anything better to listen to music from many different sources
i don not abuse headphones so these will last me a long time .
just received ordered directly from amazon after receiving a fake pair of the red ones on ebay
*i suggest buying these through amazon , not other sellers* do not try to save a few bucks and get ripped off
i would not even purchase them from amazon , buy the ones through amazon directly
please do some online research to see how to spot a fake
if you have any inklings that you may have gotten a fake , contact koss
they will not refund your money , but will try to find the seller and deal with it
these are really good headphones for the price
i also have a pair of sennheiser 202s that were a tick cheaper , but they are not as clear as these
not sure how they will hold up , but koss' lifetime guarantee is really great thing i have read
again , be sure you are getting the real are fakes out there ( biggest issue is bad spelling on would not do that )
glad i did online reasearch as this pair i received from amazon sounds way better than the fakes did
do not make that mistake
buy from a reputable seller
hope this helps out for fakes !
a classic headphone that should be in everyone is collection
these headphones have remained the same for the last <NUM> over years
recently , it has finally been made to allow iphone users to enjoy these with the mic function .
this little headphone produces beautiful sound with comfort , i liked the retro look and think it is cool
after reading so many positive reviews and saw it on sale for under $25 , why not ? i am so glad i did , the shipping took longer than expected , about <NUM> weeks but it is worthy of the wait
imo , this little headphone sounded better than beats and sol at a fraction of cost
i am a little picky about audio sound and wouldn not buy a car without a great audio system , skipped bose , went for hk logic <NUM> for my car
love this little koss and highly recommend it .
i won not say anything more than the positive reviews here
i have had a pair of portapros since 1998
i use them everyday to go to work on the trains
i literally wear them out in about a year and a half of heavy daily commuting use
the great thing is if you catch the cable on something or drop the ear pieces and they start buzzing or break something , they come with a lifetime warranty and you can send them in to koss and they will send you a replacement all for $6
i have done this about <NUM> times in <NUM> years
try that with sennheiser !
so many good reviews so i will keep it shorti have <NUM> models of koss , koss ( design , bass is plenty , light and easy on you ears ) these are very comfortable and i am wearing them now : ) koss prodj100 ( closed design , a bit more detailed and more of a solid bass but not boomy ) i find i use these for gaming allot as well as music and find them very clear : )
great shape , lightweight , good sound for inexpensive price
i love hearing bass , high notes , low notes , without being tortured by a different song coming on next on my music mix only to blow my ears out - never happens with these headphones
quality , easy to wear , they don not give you that feeling that you want to throw them because your ears won not hurt !
first , these are not intended for loud places
you should be using these for a study , or library reading etc- not in a busy loud place
these are in no way intended for blocking noise- you will end up turning them up loud , and hurt your ears
but anyway , these are nice
found em via cnet
easily fold up , but don not realy fit in the bag- i never have really needed it
as for comfort , you can not even tell they are there
as for sound- great highs , and not bad lows- all around goodness
lifetime warranty was the selling point for me- i have already gone through about <NUM> or so pairs of the cheap skull candies- i would rather have something i could depend on
just <NUM> or so bucks to ship and a new pair- i haven not had to do it yet , but it is there when i need it
all and all , awesome .
awesome low freq definition
highs are equally good
for the price
its absolutely unbeatable
haven not yet found anyone beat these old babies
i had already tried some good stuff like the klipsch custom 3
porta pro rules
i have had the same pair for <NUM> years
here is all you need to know
they are durable
-i put them in my backpack with huge math books every day for school
-i have spilled coffee on them
-i have kicked them , and pulled on the cord with my feet by accident
-my fat friend stepped on them
-they have dealt with volume spikes and loud sounds
after all of this they look and work perfect
they sound great ! -i own a pair of 8" studio monitors , professional stuff
these don not sound quite as accurate , but i still choose ur20 is over my monitors a lot of the time , and enjoy the ur20 is immensely
they are durable and sound great , what more could you want ? : dplease rate this review as helpful , otherwise , leave a comment letting me know how my review could have been more helpful
thank you !
ok , i searched for some headphones that were and durable
these headphones are look and sound excellent ! i can not believe i used to have a pair of sony , i know you can not compare the two , but these headphones are my personal favorite headphones that feel and sound amazing in my ears
! thanks amazon !
great headphones
comfortable but not especially lite weight
i would purchase again
i like the single cord
xxx xxx xxxx
wish i would have bought a different pair , as now i am back on here searching for replacements
the sound of these is decent , but you will find the cushions fall apart quickly and the pair will end up in a landfill after little use
do yourself a favor and buy something more durable .
these koss headphones are such a great buy
less than $20 and u get a very comfortable fitting set and great sound too
these , of course , do not have audiophile quality , but for the everyday joe who wants good sound and fit at a great price these are the ticket
; )
have had these for over a year after getting them for a good deal ( although more than the $15 they are going for right now ) using them daily , sometimes up to <NUM> hours or more in a row for listening to music while surfing the net or playing video games , and i have been nothing but happy with them
but i recently strayed
i bought a pair of audiotechnic m50s after reading all the great reviews , and guess what ? i like the koss ur 20s better
i was shocked
yes , the audiotechnics unquestionably separate the different instruments better , give a crisper sound overall with a slightly punchier base and cleaner treble ( for $100+ more they ought to , but the mids are quite recessed and the music more sterilized and not really more enjoyable to listen to , and more than anything , they weren not even close to as comfortable as the koss ur 20
they began to become uncomfortably hot like an ear sauna after about minutes , and the overall enjoyment of listening wasn not $100+
i sent them back immediately and am listening to music right now on my koss ur20s
for $15
and needing them for just listening to music or movie watching , i just can not even think of a reason not to have a pair of these for around the house or at the computer
so comfortable i could sleep in them , sound is good with these huge cans , and no ear sauna
while true audiophiles may need to look elsewhere , they are great for everyday listening and use .
i suppose you shouldn not expect "spectacular" sound at this price
the headphones are well made and comfortable
all in all , worth the money
i am satisfied .
no jarring , no overly crazy treble sounds , and yet deep and rich
i have been using this headphones for about <NUM> 1/2 years and i have found its pretty good in sound reproduction and does not break/damage easily
its also very soft on ears and does not pain the ear lobes like sony or others do
the headband is supple , yet strong , meaning it will be firm over your ears , but not paining
comes closest to feature because it covers your ears completely .
the first time i bought these was about <NUM> years ago
they are still working just like new , without any distortion
comfort of these is amazing
few days ago i have ordered another pair and some ear cushion replacement
the best headphones for the price !
i have these hooked up to my computer because i listen to radio and watch netflex while i shop or read
these work great as far as blocking the tv noise .
it is good , not as good as my other senheiser ones , but for the price it is really good , it compares with headphones that cost times more , if the size does not matter
well isolated from outside world sound .
i am not a
i bought these headphones to watch movies as i don not listen to much music
these phones have a great sound
like others who have noted the enhanced bass , i love the bass
i view them as headphones
they delvier great sound but do not have the extra bells and whistles of more expensive models ( as these are very reasonably priced )
for example , they do not have the sound adjustment switch on the cord and the cord is coiled so you are not always dragging around cord that is continuously getting hung up on something
the only down side i have noticed is fairly peculiar to people with , how shall we say , heads
they are comfortable
the foam totally encloses the ear so that there is no sound loss or outside sound distractions
but i do have to occasionally readjust their position when listening to long movies to avoid feeling cramped
the head band does adjust but does not offer a wide range of expansion
to put this in perspective , i have a pair of phillipssbc hp250s that i can not wear for more than <NUM> minutes without getting a headache
i also have a pair of panasonic that are far more comfortable but aren not as comfortable as these
other than that small inconvenience , i would highly recommend these phones , particularly to people who don not place high demands on audio tolerances but just want to watch a movie with great sound
as a matter of fact , i am considering getting a second set to take to work to listen to talk radio .
works great for my needs , but i am not a fan of the coiled wire and angled plug
thankfully the coil is a softer compound so it doesn not pull on my head during use , but i would have preferred a straight wire
i know i know-- &<HASHTAG> ; it was in the details&<HASHTAG> ;
well , i admit i apparently didn not read them all
the angled plug is more an issue , since a straight plug fits my needs better
i shopped koss based on another koss headset i bought
i'd buy koss again ( obviously ) .
i trusted the koss name that these would sound decent , but was surprised they sound as good , and are as comfortable as they are
i have a much more expensive set of a different brand and these sound comparable , and are definitely more comfortable
( these were a christmas gift for my mom
she is very happy with them , too
i think this is a very good sounding and comfortable headphone
it is light , and you can wear them for hours without feeling pinched
however , it is made out of cheap hard plastic
the first pair broke after a year , and its replacement just broke again
so on average each pair lasted for about a year
both time , the plastic pieces broke and the headphone practically flew apart
good thing is koss offers lifetime warranty , $6 for each repair
the downside is shipping it back to them is not cheap , and you will be headphoneless for weeks
i think i will use the cheapest us mail to ship it back this time
i will use my pro4aa while the r80 is in the shop
the pro4aa is heavier , but also much more durable , the parts are all aluminum
unfortunately , it does not sound as good and it pinches my ears quite a bit for long duration listening .
i am not an audiophile but i think these sound good
mostly good bass response and block of the surrounding sounds
i have been using mine at work every day of the week
they are just as good as the day i bought them
i have dropped them a few times but they don not seem to care
if these ever break i will buy another pair
good value for the price
( updated ) i have now had these for a few months
( using them right now as i type ) i use them everyday at work , i drop them regularly , and they look and work as good as the day i bought them .
ugly as hell but they work well
i wouldn not wear them outside
i have been falling asleep with them on for maybe <NUM> days now and they haven not broken
not uncomfortable to sleep with
very light weight and feel good on my head and ward
again , in case i wasn not clear
they are really freaking ugly !
i loved these headphones at first
great bass , sound quality was above standard for the price
but i cannot recommend this product to anyone because of the faulty construction
the bent almost right away distorting the sound almost the first week i got it
i didn not have an option at the time so i used them tell i found my earbuds
then they broke again completely severing the right side of the headphones from the rest of it
don not buy it
oh yea , went on vacation forgot about the return policy time ( my fault ) then boom
i got stuck with broken headphones .
i have had the koss ur -20 headphones for over a year
i used them for studio recording and mixing
i use them with my headphone amp to make them sound better
the sound is balanced in these headphones
i do like the build quality of these headphones
i use these as my back up pair of headphones
i recently upgraded to the tascam th02 .
really nice pair of headphones ( replacing an older set of koss is , destroyed by my cat ) - robust bass , etc
ear coverage good , rugged cord
looks like a decent pair that should last a long time ( cat permitting ) .
koss r80 reviewwhen my <NUM> year old headphones died a few months ago , i went on the hunt for a replacement pair
in all things , my preference is to buy american made , or at least american designed and owned , so i looked first at koss
bose and several others qualify too
i have a bunch of very high end speakers and amplifiers rounding out at $8k for my primary system , so my ears are spoiled
see my review of akg <NUM> headphones for listing of my test system and cds
i bought the akgs for best sound quality available for less than $1000akg k702 reference class headphonemy requirements were : * fits big noggin* comfortable for hours of use* sounds great* less than $400* eliminates noise from dishwasher , vacuum and significant other when i am listening* for use at home in my favorite chair* no leakage so my daughter can sit next to me reading or doing her homeworkrequirements translated into features : * over the ear cups that completely encase the ear* adjustable headband that fits big heads , not giant* sling configuration headbands are the best for long wearing comfort and rest on the head as opposed to clamping on the head and ears
if you move around a lot with headphones on , slings are not for you
* closed cans , to isolate outside sounds
no leakage in or out* long straight cable , preferably replaceablekoss r80 reviewwhy r80 : same drivers as highly acclaimed koss porta pro open headphones , replaceable cord , closed cans , us company made in korea , adjustable headband , familiar name from the old days who made audiophile quality headphones
available straight or coiled cord
pros* semi sling adjustable headband* closed cans and ear pad do eliminate leakage* sound quality is good but not great , if the akg 702s are a <PERCENT> of perfection , these are an 85-<PERCENT>* price , these are very affordable headphones that should last a long time* build quality appears to be good , time is the best judge for reliability* the drivers should last forever* replaceable ear pads and cordscons* fit is good for medium and small noggins , a bit tight for my large noggin
* closed cans and ear pads do not breath and can get very hot with a tight fit , it may be the material the ear pads are made of , possibly koss could add some venting to the closed cans to alleviate the heat buildup* sound quality is good , not great ; but for the price , <NUM> tenth of the akgs , hard to argue with* sound stage is a bit narrow compared to akg 702s and audio technica open and closed 700s , both 3x to 4x more money
narrow sound stage may be a result of the closed can damping implementation and the materiel in the padssummaryin reading the other koss reviews , if you are looking for stationary listening affordable koss headphones , the ur40 open backs may be a very good option since they both breath and allow the drivers to move freely without damping concerns
leakage would be a factor , but the sound stage should be bigger and heat gone
koss ur40 collapsible headphonesmy impression is that that from a design point of view the r80 was a good first effort by the koss designers who should follow up by moving the r80 drivers and replaceable cord config to the r20 sling and bigger rounded ear pads configuration and offer the r80 in open and closed back cans like the at 700
if the sling and ear pad materials on the r20 config can be significantly upgraded for a few bucks the designers should do it
until koss addresses the heat build up issue , they will always be at a significant disadvantage with an easily correctable problem
koss should benchmark their ur20 , ur <NUM> and r80 vs the at <NUM> for fit and comfort and continue to use their existing drivers
closed dynamic audiophile headphones , <NUM> mm drivers with neodymium magnet systems , 3
5 mm connector w/ 1/4" adapteropen canaudio technica dynamic audiophile headphones with 53mm drivers with neodymium magnet systemskoss needs to decide the target market customer for each product and clearly state the applications on their web site , commerce sites and packaging , otherwise one is left guessing what the koss designers were thinking when they designed the unit
simply buying the units to see what they sound like and how they fit is both expensive and time consuming
head size recommendations would be giant plus on their web site
there must be several attractive people already working at koss that could model their headphones on their web site with different views showing the connected equipment and applications , the cost to koss for providing more and better photos would be $zero
alternatively , koss could go all out and pay a professional photographer a few hundred for a photo shoot using koss employees wearing the headphones and jacked into the target equipment like : , chair next to expensive stereo , next to sampling kiosk in store , sitting in an airplane pilots seat , ham radio etc
in the end , i gave the r80s to my <NUM> year old since her head is smaller than mine , the clamping is not as tight resulting in less heat buildup
for listening to her nano , nintendo game and pc applications the headphones are perfect
they are her early christmas gift
i had planned to use them with my pc but too tight and too hot , stereo and movie listening was a long shot based on the drivers that didn not work out
recommendationif your head isn not big , and you are looking for some this might be the pair for you for all stationary applications including sitting at your work cube jacked in
noise isolation is good
cans don not fold and they are not canceling so using them on the commuter train or airplane may not work
if you wear them walking around the neighborhood , make sure you have great insurance since you would be likely to walk in front of a car or truck .
for this price they are very good
they are boomier than the koss porta pro but they completely cover the ear
really well for watching movies or tv
musically , they are fine just not as clean as the .
sound is , little bass
i bought this for my nephew to use with his christmas kindle hd
i chose this due to reviews and because it seems durable for a child ( which it really is )
very flexible , comfortable , really long cord
sound sound is good for the price just don not expect something outstanding for the size
but for simple video games and movies/music that you don not plan on playing at ear bursting levels
this performs very well
i will easily recommend over cheap earbuds
something to travel with that is comfy , sounds decent , won not break , and you won not cry over if lost/stolen .
i use bose when travelling for the noise cancellation , but i don not need to leave the bose around so the cat can play with it at home
this is a great substitue
the padding is comfy and seals external noise from getting in
perhaps not as neatly as a $300 pair of bose , but eminently reasonable for hanging around home
a great bargain to boot ! thanks koss - even your cheap ones are fabulous .
these have huge ear cups , making them extraordinarily comfortable
the cord is much longer than most , giving you a lot of room to move around
for the price , nothing beats these
as a side note , i wear hearing aids , and even with those in , these are still roomy and comfortable .
i purchased these to use for emtal detecting but ended up useing them for gaming on my laptop in peace also
for the price they are great and i have been abuseing them to see if they can handle stress from heavy use
they have held up great and if they ever do fall i will replace them with the same unit .
i must say , these headphones are definitely unique
the drivers are huge , and so are the headphones themselves
these are insanely comfortable , lightweight , and easy to use
audio quality is the major problem here
these sound very compared to other headphones in this price range
i would not recommend these whatsoever
if you are looking for headphones in this price range , i would go for the monoprice 8323
best headphones you can get under $50 .
i have other high tend phones but i like koss so i thought the price was right and bought them
i have to say these are way better than one would think
they live up to the koss name all i can say
oh they have a very open clear high end and the mids are full and strong
the bass is defined and not too strong not to over power the rest of the spectrum
the only thing i don not like is the cord is a little too thick and long for my taste .
i bought these for my father who is temporarily bedridden
they are ideal for the rough treatment this of cord tugging , pulling and crushing
they block out noise better than the style too .
i was expecting a decent bass but the r80 is quite lean in bass
mids and treble are balanced to my ears but the lack of bass makes the r80 not suitable for listening to my music
build quality is better than i thought though .
the koss is a sensational set of headphones for such a modest price
the sound is rich , full , and clear
the bass is deep , the treble sparkles , and the pads keep everything going in the right direction
you can really enjoy the music while those around you are going about their own affairs
unlike so many models , the volume is more than adequate
i am using them right now , and i have had to turn the sound down three times since the music began
with other sets in the same price range , you can crank the sound up as far as it will go , and it is still barely audible
the koss really gets the job done
the headband is comfortable , and the weight is not outrageous
you are always aware that you have them on , but it is neither unpleasant nor distracting
the one downside is that over time ( and i have had mine for years , ) the pads shed a bit , tiny black particles of vinyl flaking off
once they are completely gone , the cloth beneath still holds up well
it is actually more comfortable without the vinyl coating
i use these headphones every day , sometimes for hours at a time , and they are still going strong
i couldn not be more pleased .
i use these to monitor playback during recording sessions
they sound fine and are lightweight and comfortable
three more words .
i like the rounded shape of these and the way they cover my ears are comfortable they fit nicely and are affordable .
i got these because my phones ( also koss ) died
while they are repairing/replacing , i got these
they are good for my stereo
if , however , you use them in the pc and want outside noise blocked , they are not as good as the noise cancelling ones .
if you bought the most expensive headphones you can , they would not be a lot better than these
the price was great
they got to my house five days before promised
overall the sound quality , price , and speed of delivery were all reasons to come back to amazon .
i bought these as a replacement to the cheap headphones i received with my three tone detector , which lasted about <NUM> months of on and off use as i use ear buds in the summer heat
they are well made and have a substantial cord length which makes them ideal for setting the detector down and working away from the unit
although i have gathered up the excess cable and zip tied it off on the shaft where it is out of the way
these are exactly the same as what other retailers offer , but without the camouflage , for $30 less
oh , and the size of the muffs really help keep your ears warm in chilly , windy weather
the only negative i can think of is that the cord is not made of a silicon rubber which doesn not get stiff in cold weather
if they did that , i'd give them <NUM> stars .
i got these to muffle the bodily noises from the offices around mine
the headphones are well made and the sound is ok , but the fit is poor
they cover my entire ears , but they don not fit snugly against my head
they are loosest at the bottom of the earcups , at the bottom of my ears
a little adjustment of the width is possible , by bending the two wires seen at the top of the image , but it doesn not affect the tension , which is the issue
as such , now i have music , with just as much hacking and coughing and snorting and throat clearing and other mucousy sounds .
purchased these june 13 , 2013
i was tired of my son breaking my expensive headphones and decided to try these as they looked industrial strength
they do the job and didn not cost that much
you will have to adjust the equalizer settings on your pc or whatever you use these for as they don not seem to be quite right with the neutral settings of most devices
i like the wire on one side only , but i don not care for the constant adjusting that is required ; they seem to reset to shorter way more easily when i set them down than when i try to lengthen them when putting them on
i also don not care for the bulkiness ; it would seem that they would be somewhat noise canceling just by the size , but no such luck
for the money though , they work as well as could be expected
update august 30 , 2013 : so much for durability ; used them today and they broke
the size adjustment things on the head band broke
i am careful with my usage of anything i buy and am very disappointed with only 2
5 months of use
a close look at the adjustment fittings show that they are of low quality
definitely will never buy koss again .
i had some coby headphones around the same price as these , and i prefer thoes coby ones over these , sadly
the coby ones i didnt have to tune my computers equalizer to make them sound right , these i do and i shouldnt have to
unless this is user error , i dont think i need to tune my comp to sound right
however on a plus for these , they are very comfortable to wear , and they are big headphones , also the bass is pretty , good
after all i guess you get what you pay for
i wish i didnt have to edit the sound , it sounds like im outside of a techno club listening through a wall , the sound doenst sound like im right there so to speak
i had to tune the 16khz up pretty much and the 1 , 2 , 4 , and <NUM> up a bit , to make it sound right
the lower end just a touch for a tad more bass
other then that theres my review <NUM> stars .
these are very comfortable headphones
i don not notice any ear fatigue at all
they are tuned for a little extra bass which some may not like , but this is one of the reasons i chose koss
essentially they always have the &<HASHTAG> ; loud&<HASHTAG> ; turned on
i don not turn the volume up very loud , but i still want to feel the kick drum and bass guitar when playing music
additionally , the other frequencies are still heard
voices are easily heard
for $15 these are excellent headphones
the only reason i didn not give them <NUM> stars is that the cord maintains the shape it was in from the box too long
it doesn not forget that it was folded and that is easily forgiven considering the price paid
they are big but i listen to these at home when the kids are asleep and i don not want to wake them .
i have had mine for three years now , and i find the ur20s indispensible , since i live in an apartment and can not turn the tv up to a decent level otherwise
there is reasonable bass ; you would expect so for the size of them
always look at the specs
the low number is the bass , the high number ( usually in the tens of thousands ) is the treble
this set is bass is <NUM> hertz
that is that is not a bad number ; <NUM> is average , <NUM> would be phenomenal
the treble is set at 20 , 000 hertz
theoretically , only dogs can hear frequencies above that , but i think a headphone with a figure over that just seems to sound brighter in the treble , which is what i like
i hate unclear treble and muddy , distorted bass
another number you look at is sensitivity ; the better ones are always over 100
so , i guess based on the specs , these 'phones are about average
the cord length is excellent at <NUM> feet
i can be a reasonable distance away from the tv without straining the cord ; i have even slept with them on without ear fatigue
these headphones make movie watching a whole new experience
you get surround sound without the expense ! i have had a great experience with the ur20s and i recommend them for use with home theater , even if you just have a 20&quot ; portable like mine
you need an adapter to plug them into a home stereo , and there is plenty of cord where you can be either reasonably mobile or you can sit in your favorite chair some distance away
i think they are great
the only thing that would make them the best is better specs , and that is hard to find at this price range .
given their price , these are pretty decent headphones , and worth the cash
my only two problems with it - first , they need to be resized every time you put them on , because they seem to suffer from &quot ; pool shrinkage&quot ; - they shrink to the smallest size once you take them off
and second is the one brought up fairly often - they don not do anything to block out outside noise
which isn not that big a deal , as i didn not really need headphones anyway .
for the money , these are excellent
i am not very discriminating so can not comment on fidelity ; i use these for my electric piano
they cover my ears well , provide clear sound and are comfortable for extended ( one hour or so ) wear
also they are cool looking .
these are really good headphones i had the when i was locked up and these are the sameones but they just aren not clear
you can not beat this quality of this headphone for this price
i have bought alot of different pairs that cost more and they can not match koss
i love them and yes i would recommend !
i bought these for my daughter for christmas
they broke about <NUM> weeks ago
only one speaker works
they were sent off to the landfill soon after
i wouldn not buy them again .
bought these for my wife to use with her kindle fire
good volume and tone , extremely comfortable ear cups and head band , blocks out background noise very well
you'd have to spend double or triple the cost to get a better sounding pair
the only change i'd make is a better adjustment mechanism
the present design &<HASHTAG> ; locks&<HASHTAG> ; into position when the cups are spreadapart , as soon as you take them off they are free to slide out of adjustment
my solution was to twist tie the top of the plastic yolks tothe two wire bars so there is always tension on the locking mechanism
a spring loaded &<HASHTAG> ; t&<HASHTAG> ; shaped bar could do the same and be adjustable for a small cost increase .
this headphones are very comfortable , i would recomend to anyone that need a headphones , i only use them with my pc , the only thing i didn not like was the bass i almost can hear itestos audifonos son muy c&oacute ; modos , tienen un buen volumen y buen aislamento de sonido , lo recomiendo a cualquiera que necesite unos audifonos no tan caros , yo solo los utilizo para mi computadora , me parece que son muy grandes para cargarlos siempre encima pero de todas formas ese era el uso que le queria dar , lo &uacute ; nico malo es que le falta m&aacute ; s bajo
i read one review that said "koss warranty a joke"i am not sure how the warranty is these days , but it used to be great
i bought a pair of "sear is branded" koss headphones so many years ago i can not even remember what decade it was
when i bought mine , there was a one year warranty
after several years of hard use , the cord messed up , one of the ear pieces had broken loose , and a couple of wires had broken from the ear pieces
all of this was my fault
i couldn not bring myself to throw them away , so i stuck them in the closet
several years later ( probably <NUM> or more years ) , when koss announced the change in their warranty , i sent these things in ( at my cost - didn not cost but a couple of bucks ) hoping they could be fixed
within a few weeks , i got my headphones back in like new condition
koss paid for the return shipping
my headphones have to be at least <NUM> years old now , and still going stong
: )
these earphones are big ! seriously , the picture does not prepare you for how large they are
but , their large size helps to the be very comfortable
the sound is not as good as i was hoping
things tend to sound a little mushy through them to me
but , for under $20 , you won not find anything better
based on prior experience with koss earphones , i am expecting these to last a very long time
their large size and lack of audio isolation makes them best for use in the home
i use mine for computer games and watching movies on my laptop .
i have had the koss r10 headphones for more than <NUM> years and they finally need to be replaced
i use them mainly to listen to movies through my audio system
i am not an audiophile , but i like the sound i get out of them
after only a year or so , the plastic frame that holds the ear cup cracked and broke
i put some epoxy in it and kept using it because the speakers still sounded fine
after a few more years , the "leatherette" padding started flaking and leaving little black specks on my ears
fast forward a few more years and the smooth coating had completely flaked off , leaving a comfortable , fuzzy fabric
koss should have used this fabric to start with
i didn not have any more problems from them until the right speaker started cutting out a few days ago
it is now time to use the lifetime warranty and get them replaced
oddly , it will cost almost the same to mail them in and pay the $9 processing fee as it will to simply buy a new pair from amazon .
i really do like these headphones
they sound pretty good
are very comfortable
this is rare for me as i have a big head
they have a very nice coiled long cord
the only negative is that they are ugly
but hell , they are inexpensive to : )
as of 06/04/2014 , amazon is page on these headphones states "detachable , , single entry coiled cord with 3
5 mm ( 1/ ) plug and 6
3 mm ( 1/ ) type adapter for flexibility and reliability"
i can assure you that the item which amazon just shipped me does not have a detachable cord
amazon is description also suggests "and 6
3 mm ( 1/ ) type adapter" is included
it is not in the product
however , that is not a deal breaker ; i have a few of these laying around
sound quality is good , and the fit is good for my large head , and does a good job ( but not excellent ) of isolating outside noise
i am still debating whether to return these to amazon because of the cord not being detachable ; it was one of the primary reasons i wanted to purchase this set of headphones .
got these for my wife
i have listend to them too
great sound
full range and bass
a lot better than the ear plugs
also , cancels out a good bit of noise .
these don not adjust small enough for me to wear
i have bought lots of headphones over the years without issue - if you are a big person , these might be fine .
i bought these headphones as a replacement for my sennheiser hd202 ( which i loved )
the problem with my hd202 is and many other headphones ( i owned many ) is that i would lose sound in one of the ears after a long period of time
( usually after months ) i found out that due to twisting wires ( i would wrap my wire around the headphones after use ) it could damage them and the special coating inside them
this is one of the reasons i love these headphones
there is a coiled wire , and it is only attached to one side
very clever indeed also , the wire isn not a ridiculous 6ft
the construction of them is plastic , so it doesn not feel the strongest
( my first pair arrived damaged and i had to get a replacement ) sound quality is usual
nothing outstanding , but it is not terrible , believe me , it has quality sound
just don not be expecting bose quality
it fits my head nicely
for the price , i recommend these to anyone who wants some great headphones .
these are ok
sound is ok
i am not impressed at all but they work
my biggest complaint is they are lose on my head
so they must be made for a giant head
can not adjust them smaller
they cover your whole ear but since they are loose can hear all the background noise so not good for a dj .
positives : comfortablenegatives : sound floods in and out , and is of $8 quality
summary : i wanted to support an originally business , but these are in every way chinese for the budget crowd
spend more money for something with better isolation , sound , and construction .
right , you can spend a lot of money on , and not hear much more
these are well worth twice the price .
i bought these as a birthday present for my father , and he couldn not be happier with them ! he loves to listen to music at a crazy volume , and these protect his ears while muffling the sound for those of us working near him
plus , the cord is long enough so that he doesn not have to sit right next to the stereo , and he can move without fear of the bit being ripped out
can not recommend these highly enough , especially for the price !
it is a slightly snugger fit than i'd like , and my office is warm enough that i get warm with headphones on , but they sound good and feel good when on
update : after using them for a while and trying other headphones , these sounds pretty muddy
maybe they changed over time
but for the price they are still a pretty good deal .
i wasn not sure about these because of the price - i thought maybe fine for me or my teenager but i took a chance because i found a few good reviews
my husband is a bass player with a bad right ear who is super picky about his sound when listening to music
bought these for him for the computer
he loves them
i tried them , too
you can not hear anything else ( like the kids - yay ! - lol ) but your music and the quality of the sound is excellent
are these as good as $200 headphones ? no , probably not ( i can not afford to even try out a pair of those ) but for the money i'd say you can not go wrong with these
my husband says anything made by koss is great , and these prove it .
i like these headphones in that they do cover my ears and fit my ( large ) head
good sound and comfortable enough : ) they seem well enough made .
you can only be careful when you buy something that looks good but it is too cheap , and these headphones do look great , they do feel comfy , they cover my entire ear , and the sound it is awesome , so yes i took the risk and i did right , these headphones for sure deliver great sound and the best part of it the price
i totally recommend them , just keep in mind that if you have been using expensive equipment you might find these only to be ok , if all you want is to listen music , or just watch movies with these , they are great .
the very best feature about this feature is that the ear cups are huge
i have seen some previous reviews complaining that they were too big , but i think they are terrific
i have big ears , so these are perfect for me
the only con is that the headphones can easily adjust the sliders
when you pull the headset to fit your head , the sliders that change the head size will shrink
overall : 9/10
i recently purchased a pair of the koss r80 and all i can say is they have a very nice clean sound and despite what people have said about build quality they seamed decently built for a pair of $34 dollar head phones
the problem is the cord was defective on both pairs i ordered ( i had to replace the first pair ) , the right channel would cut in and out
i wish i could say that all the negative review it gets are unwarranted but i can not
i would avoid the koss of head phones and look else where .
i use headphones for tv viewing so as to not bother my wife
these over the ear headphones fit excellent over the ear
no pressure on my head
block out other sound excellent .
i bought two pairs of these when i saw them in a store on sale for under $15 each
they have both gotten extensive use over the past couple years
the cushioning on the outside is cloth inside a black material that i suppose imitates leather in looks and feel
this outer material on the cushions has worn off in flakes on both pairs , which makes it look raggedy , but the comfort and sound quality isn not affected by it so i don not consider it a big deal
the headband adjust on one side of one pair seems to have had something break inside it which lets that earmuff go farther down than it "should , " but likewise , it is something to be expected with this much use and hasn not affected comfort
the cable is also thicker than most headphone cables i am used to , which is good news for people who find themselves constantly rolling over cables with their chairs and such
i have compared the sound quality to the koss is ( which i own ) and a library is koss is or 15 is ( can not remember which )
though the is do sound better when they have their active noise cancelling feature turned on , the is are the most comfortable of the three , have the richest bass , are the most durable , and won not eat up your aaa batteries like the is .
not the most expensive brand , top end noise cancelling headphones
but these work great with lumix and microphone in a crowd
cuts a lot of the ambient sound to make hearing dialogue easier in a crowded setting .
i use these headphones at home for casual use
they are perfect for that situation
they are very comfortable and the sound quality is good for this price .
we were looking for a nice sturdy set of headphones that our <NUM> year old wouldn not break in a matter of minutes
not only do they sound great and block a large amount of ambient sound , the single cord on the left side is nice and thick
we don not have to worry about the chair rolling over the cord
the chair could probably roll over it a few dozen times with no fear of breaking
for the price , this is a wonderful sturdy set of headphones .
good sound quality for such a low price
i like that the cable comes out of only the left side .
these are great headphones for watching the tube and casual listening at home or work
they are comfortable and block out external noise really well
lifetime warranty to boot ! they sound good - smooth , flat and full - but are not "audiophile" quality
you could do a lot worse for a lot more jing ! stick with koss , they know "cans ! "
this review is for the koss headphones
the sound is pretty good , but i personally feel like the bass is lacking
it is ok i guess
i love the cord length
my previous headphones had a real short cord , so this cord is a welcome change ( i think it is 8ft )
i kinda wish that the cord came out of the right speaker , but that is just splittin' hairs
it is good at blocking out most outside sounds ( when my mp3 player is turned all the way up ) , which is great , cause my house is like american idol
people singing alllll the time
it is so annoying ! so i bought these specifically to block them out
for the price , i guess i can not expect much more
these headphones are pretty good
some things i wanna add to this review
the cord is thick
i don not know how important that is , but there it is
these headphones are kinda annoying cause you have to readjust them every time you are about to listen to music .
i am <NUM> years old
i have owned a lot of headphones
years ago you had to pay a lot to get a descent set
as the products got better you have ear buds that sound incredible and you can buy a cheap set of headphones for <NUM> dollars that sound really good but there overall range is limited and they are not very comfortable to wear
i have owned sennheiser wireless headphones that i paid <NUM> dollars for and i don not remember anything that sounds as good as these and are as comfortable to wear
as far as i am concerned anybody who can not appreciate the quality of these headphones for <NUM> times the price is just being picky
i would recommend these koss to anybody
thanks for the great deal !
i have had these for several years and they have been subjected to steady use
i am writing this review far , far in arrears
the sound quality is good
it is not a legitimate listening experience but for general purposes they are good
the bass is not spectacular
it is present , but it is not what i'd call deep and rich
the treble is also good but not especially crisp
the sound quality is adequate
if you are accustomed to listening to headphones , or a decent home system with a powered 10- or sub , this doesn not hold up
i have had these for several years
they have been used for casual listening on the laptop , gaming , and to cover my ears while i am mowing the lawn
so - a lot of sweat , a lot of wear and tear
they are pretty comfortable
this year the covering of the ear pads started to flake apart and peel off
there is a padded cloth beneath the plastic which is actually a lot more comfortable than the loose plastic cover , but it is going to get gross in a hurry if i keep using it for yard work / lawn mowing
overall these are ok
ok sound , good durability
they are all plastic and pretty light , but hey , proof is in the pudding
these have lasted for years of heavy use
the drivers are still good
i have broken other pairs of headphones with no special abuse involved so this is pretty good durability
i can not say with certainty whether there are other offerings in the same price range with better durability or performance
obviously , it would take years to do to another pair of headphones what i did to these , but overall , i'd say these are good
not stellar
not stellar sound
not stellar durability
pretty comfortable
maybe in that category
but they are not superior to a pair of sennheiser or bose or audio technica headphones
they are just
if you want good , reliable headphones , good sound , good durability , for $40 or so , this is a good fit for you
if you expect lifelong durability or stellar , audio quality and wonderful bass , this really won not do it for you .
it was surprised at the build quality of these headphones
very rugged great bass and treble , and they fit over my big head quite comfortable
you will not find a bitter headphone for the price .
sound quality is good , very little isolation though
very comfortable to wear
construction is very poor though
broke ear cups easily
would not buy again due to poor construction .
first , the sound rocks
i bought them for my teenage kids , but have swiped a pair since they block outside noise great and the sound is just awesome
however , they are huge
i didn not think they would be that big and that is the one reason my daughter doesn not much care for them
they are quite comfortable and don not seem to give me a headache like others do
if the size ( covers whole side of head ) doesn not bother you , they are great
they could adjust a little more , as in the headband part could go a little taller and then they would be just perfect .
$20 headphones , and they work great
i honestly believe that this is the best of what i can buy with the money
i like how durable it is .
these are quality headphones
i use them around the house
they look funny with the knobs on top sticking out , but i don not care about looks
if i did i would have shelled out an extra <NUM> for some beats
alas , if you want sound quality similar to dr
dre beats without the "cool" look go for these !
i bought these headphones for cheap
i got them shipped for day shipping
i got them in <NUM> days ! and they were worth every penny ! these is are amazing
this is what i wanted for a pair of headphones : -good bulky ( i hate headphones that pop out of my ears <NUM> inches ) -cheap but awesome
the is fulfilled all of these
the only complaint i have is they are sound is a little muffled
but don not let that intimidate you ! you get used to the sound quality in <NUM> hours of use
they are excellent and look very nice around your neck
also a little tip ! wear them around your neck and turn up your audio
there ! you can even use the headphones when they are not on your head ! these are a wonderful buy on every level
and i should know , i am a music producer .
these headphones are good for the price , but nowadays you can find better ones
why are these some of the best in the $10-$15 price range ? * very good sound quality , especially in treble range* sturdy , long cable with adapter* they don not break easily ( though they are still made of cheap plastic ) * they are extremely light ( still , that reflects on their plastic construction ) that much being said , they don not stand up too well to higher priced headphones
here is why : * the bass/mid/treble balance is off ; low midrange is a bit quiet* the seal on the headphones is not good at all , so you hear ambient noise and others hear your music playing* the flexible design does not always align itself properly* they require quite a lot of power from portable devicesso , there you have it
these are good headphones in their price range
however , if you are willing to pay a bit more ( perhaps some $20-$30 on sennheisers or sonys ) , you will get much better bass/mid/treble balance , better build quality ( not necessarily better sound quality , though ) , and generally a better seal around your ears
also , you are almost always going to get better bass with earbuds at this price rangestill , if $15 is the max you are willing to pay , these should do the job pretty well
just remember , these are not headphones .
i needed an inexpensive set of headphones
several manufacturers offer inexpensive headphones but i learned a long time ago that koss makes the best headphones
these headphones are built like a tank and will last a good long time
i wasn not concerned with getting the best sound money could buy
if i wanted better sound , i would have purchased a more expensive set of headphones
for what i needed , these headphones are the best .
these headphones are great
you can not find anything else that sounds this good in this price range
koss does stereophones right ! i have had my for more than a year
they still sound great and have been stuffed into my backpack almost every day since i bought them
one of my size adjuster clips has broken , but it is no doubt due to my reckless use
even broken , they fit comfortably on the head
the ear cups are big enough for anyone is ears
they cover your ear completely and do not &quot ; crowd&quot ; your ear like the smaller do
the bass is amazing and the insulating ring makes such a close seal with your head that you will not hear anything while you have these headphones on
i don not like listening to music while i sleep , but i have used these headphones as noise reducers ( without playing any music ) on many occasions and bus rides
note that these headphones are larger than most
this is probably why they sound so great
i especially like that the headband is made of rubber coated metal to keep the phones close to your head , with a cloth balancing strap below that to make it comfortable in any situation
koss is the king as far as affordable , amazing stereophones go
buy the and you will be glad you did
i have had no problems .
my girlfriend only had these for like two weeks and they just fell apart on her all of a sudden .
i picked these up as a &<HASHTAG> ; cheapie&<HASHTAG> ; set to listen to music on my phone/tablet
they are extremely comfortable , but just a tad lacking in the sound range
i wouldn not recommend them as a primary set , but as a backup to go mobile with , they are not bad , if you don not mind the size
but i just can not say enough about the comfort
they are awesome
i guess i have got big ears , because most headphones mash them against my head
i can put these on and they sit around my ears , not against them
good and comfortable for long listening periods and while it the cups don not completely block out background sound , they do allow you to focus on what you are listening to fairly well in a noisy situation
for a sub-$20 set of phones ? i am happy with them .
yes for more money you can getm ore quality
but im the type of guy that goes for the best quality at the best price and these fit the bill
produces nice clear sound and actually has some bass to it
the phones cover my ears entirly which is what i wanted since im using these in my bedroom to listen to tv while my girlfriend sleeps and theres normally fans or a air purfier on
work great
i did use them on a plane ride and found that the small earbuds the plug your ear canal shut out way more engine noise
so in that case make sure the device you are using can out out some high volume or you may not be able to hear clearly .
the title sums it up
for whatever reason , i can not get these things to sit flat on my head
the earpieces seem to fit snug at the top of my ear , then lift off my face at the bottom
this prevents me from getting a good seal , so i get more background noise coming in
aside from that , the sound is good , and for the price they perform a lot better than i expected .
i plug it in and put it on my ears
the sound from the songs i play comes through
it actually doesn not sit on my head right , but i think it is either because i have an oddly shaped head or because i stretch the cord out really far when i listen and it is like tugging on it a little bit
just a little
great sound though and they were cheap and arrived quickly
i drop them a bunch too , so they are pretty sturdy
also they are the color of black which reminds me of space , which is cool .
i am not an audiophile and use these phones for listening to ssb receivers
they fit nicely , sound good , and are comfortable
excellent for the price .
nice headphones for the money
superb bass response and clean sound free of interferrence from outside noise
the cord is awkward because it is coiled and constantly tugs on the earcups
after more than <NUM> minutes of wear , cups tend to go sweaty inside
it would help to have an uncoiled cord as an option .
i am writing a review on the koss
first off i had a pair of koss ur20
these koss off the bat feels the same in the material but it has a different design
the headband will stay in its adjusted form when if you take it off your head
it has a coiled cord which can be removed
the cord is connected like a phone card
right when i put these headphones on i heard immediate sound difference
i use these on my computer through my audiy 2zs
very nice strong midbass and low bass
it hits the notes clean and clear
never thought how great these would sound for the price
a very clean sound and strong bass
it is also very light
the only thing i dont like is the shape of the earpieces
the design needs to slim the headphones down a bit
for the price this is one nice headphone that will last
my koss ur20 still work after yrs of abuse
i just needed to replace them
get this koss and you will be glad
super fast amazon free shipping also !
for the price you will not find a better pair
sound quality is top a+ nice fit also what more can i say
&<HASHTAG> ; they cover your ears completely and a sit a little tight but comfortable&<HASHTAG> ; the sound quality is not bad at all for music and videos&<HASHTAG> ; easy to adjust but no way to lock it&<HASHTAG> ; the wire is long enough to put the computer on a table and watch videos without leaning forward
gave these as a stocking stuffer and well received
they were worn during workout , and were very comfortable as well as pretty decent sound
especially for the stocking stuffer price !
i use these with my mp3 player to listen mostly to audio books and podcasts
they stay on and are comfortable with a good length for the cord
time will tell if they become my favorite headsets .
i got a pair of these to replace the hphones that came w/ my mp3 player
i was not expecting a super audio performance out of hphones , especilaly listening to a portable mp3 source
however , the sound quality blew me away
the bass response is tremendous , and there is absolutely no reason to increase the bass boost on the player
it is an awesome little product
the only downside is the design - in trying to retrofit the portapro to an updated "behind the head" fit , the sportapros are a bit cumbersome to wear
it is best to wear them in a traditional over the head fashion .
these headphones work well if you want to listen to music but still be able to hear extraneous sounds ( like the phone ringing , baby crying , etc
) without difficulty
the problem with them is that the wire is coated with a material that , in my case , without extreme use , opened up in several places exposing the wires
koss does have a lifetime warranty on the product , however it costs one third of the item is price plus shipping to send it back , and it will most likely have the same problem
don not waste your money , get something else .
for the price , heck , for <NUM> times the price , these sound great to me
if i were to rate these on sound alone i would put them in a class with $120 to $170 headphones
they have great bass , nice high highs and are clear and undistorted in most of the situations in which i use them
i could go on for pages about how much i like the sound and how they sound , to me , like much more expensive headphones
they are open style , which is not in vogue now with people who are discovering high fidelity headphones for use with a portable player , but they are very practical when you want to be able to hear your surroundings
the fit is good
but the headband is awkward
it consists of a pair of tightly curved metal bands that are bound by two plastic slide clips
you push the clips together to extend the bands apart from each other , thereby expanding the space between the earpieces
the system works and feels pretty durable to me , but it is clumsy
or i am clumsy
either way it is unusual
but when they are on , they stay in place , and for style headphones , they are quite comfortable to me
they are also very light as they are very thin , not padded ( except on the earpieces ) and small
these are actually really good headphones for someone who wants to jump in their headphones
i think their great advantage is their sound quality
they look and feel a little flimsy , but i think they aren not as flimsy as they look
but i don not think anyone is buying these for the look , unless they are doing it ironically
the quality of sound is the star here
i don not think they sound as good as $200 headphones , but that isn not bad , considering the fact they usually sell for around $24
for identical sound ( as far as i am concerned ) with a simpler and less expensive headband , i suggest the koss ktxpro1 at about $18
it is technically a different driver ( titanium coated ) , but i cannot hear a difference and i find the headband easier to deal with .
the headphones provide great sound throughout their sound range
even though they are not over ear headphones the bass is solid , and always there without downing out midrange or the high notes
they can be worn for extended periods of time without fatigue , and your ears do not sweat
i would strongly suggest incurring the additional expense for an volume cotrol to watch movies
since your not next to your receiver it makes volume adjustments much easier .
good sound , would certainly buy another set
i just might soon , for back up
excellent sound
i have some live recordings and sometimes find myself looking around for planes flying
but it is just in the recording ! they might look kind of stupid , but they sound great and are very sturdy for work outs
good score ! jan <NUM> updatestill going strong
use them for my workouts
got that retro starsky vibe .
i love these headphones ; they have got superb sound ( particularly the bass region--i didn not know headphones were capable of this kind of bass ! ) , they are very portable , inexpensive , and the accessories &amp ; features it comes with are great
they are also very comfortable ( particularly because of the foam pads that secure the phones behind/above your ears ) , although i have a small head and i have heard that these phones don not fit so well on bigger heads
i also like the way they look , and the lifetime warranty is a nice bonus .
these headphones have teriffic sound regardless of their low price
i own a few pairs of quality headphones , including a pair of etymotic er4p is
the koss sporta pro 'phones sound great and the price is fantastic
the bass is incredible and the highs and mids are great as well
these 'phones are worth the price , and then some .
these things are fantastic for the price and portability
i bought them because i hate ear buds and wanted something with more oomph but without the clumsiness of wrap around headsets so i could walk and listen to music on my cell phone
very nice bass and treble with a little loss on the mid range
i have always loved koss and these are no exception
*these are my gym headphones*i am a firm believer in koss quality sound , and these babies don not disappoint
they are basically the porta pro is but the &<HASHTAG> ; gym/sport&<HASHTAG> ; version
the lows frequency is strong , and the highs are adequate , the way i like it
sometimes they can get a little bass heavy but it mainly depends on what your listening too
since i am listening to mostly heavy music , i don not have to face the bass issue much , but can enjoy the great highs that come with the package
as far as comfort ; using these in the gym when i first got them , was a bit of a hassle , mainly due to the fact that i was wearing them wrong
i watched a video on how exactly the headband actually clips backwards behind your neck and tightening the temple cushions to situate the headphones
from that point the comfort level was perfect for me to enjoy these headphones while i work out
the only issue i have with these headphones is the foam cushions start to feel uncomfortable during the end of my workouts
they start to get soggy and make my ears itch while i am trying to finish the last of my workout
other than that , i love wearing them in the gym .
these have been , by far , the best headphones for running that i have come across
i have purchased several headphones , some designed for sports , and either the cord would transmit feedback when it would hit my body , or i was constantly fiddling with the buds staying in my ear canal
if you can get past the of these koss , they will give you runs
also noteworthy , they sit on top of your ears , so you can still hear what is going on around you
i never really liked running with my ears in isolation from the rest of the world
call it a safety factor , but i prefer to hear what is going on around me .
i bought this headphones for my wife , and i have sennheiser hd580 for home and koss ksc75 for portable
compared to much more neutral hd580 , bass is a little on the heavy side , and treble has a little more sparkle
but , these headphones are very enjoyable and quite detailed
the emphasis on the bass is largely due to the part of the headband where the drivers snap into
that round and concave surface right behind the divers amplifies the bass notes quite a bit
i took the drivers off the headband and put them into ksc75 is ear clip ( effectively making them ksc35 ) to see how the sound changes , and it confirmed my theory
once off the headband , the sound signature became very similar to ksc75 is with a little more bass and a little less sparkle in the high frequency range
then i put ksc75 divers in sporta pro is headband , and well ksc75 became a bass monster
so by switching the dirvers back and forth , i can have for different headphones , sporta pro , ksc75 , "sporta75" and ksc35 , all for less than the price of ksc35 from koss website
money well spent !
i wanted good headphones for my mp3 player and these fit the bill just fine for me
they are the best i have found in the price range , and pretty comfortable too
some other reviewers found them unattractive , but i don not think they are that bad
i'd rather have good sound and comfort than cute any day ! i like that they fold for storage , and come with their own little bag
i am considering getting a hard shell case for them though , as the bag doesn not offer much protection
<NUM> - i have had these little headphones for over <NUM> years now , and they are as good , or better , than when i bought them
they are very well made , and i have since purchased <NUM> pair of portapro phones and a pair of koss earbuds as well based on my love of these
i haven not been disappointed yet
i have suggested these to several friends looking for good budget headphones , and have heard good things from them as well
for the money you can not beat them .
extremely hapy with these
i was looking to replace the pricy koss portapros , had tried the koss ksc75 portables but found them awkward and too fragile , as well as koss&<HASHTAG> ; s &<HASHTAG> ; the plug , &<HASHTAG> ; which yes&<HASHTAG> ; keep falling out of the ear
the sportpros are actually a portapros , same head construction , ear pieces , leather case , and plug adapter for half the price with the same great sound
not to take anything away from the portapros , but i can have two sets of these for the same price
they stay on your head , they stay on your ear , so you don&<HASHTAG> ; t have to worry about them falling out like the plugs or have to wrestle with the hooks of the ksc75 portables
just better headphone&<HASHTAG> ; nuf&<HASHTAG> ; said .
i had a koss ksc75 and it broke , so because i didn not want to pay $9 to ship it to koss to get repaired ( i bought it new for $10 ) , i decided to get another version of koss
a lot of people said this has the same drive as ksc75 , so because i like to exercise and play sports and i really really like the sound of ksc75 , i figured i want something that doesn not slip or fall out when i exercise and has similar sound to ksc75 ( great sound quality and heavy bass )
well when i got sportapro the first time , i was kinda disappointed because it didn not have enough bass ( i thought my ksc75 had more bass and even better sound )
but after <NUM> months , i learned to like this headphones , and probably after it got &<HASHTAG> ; burned&<HASHTAG> ; for enough hours , the real sound came out and i admit that it also has deep bass
the sound quality is already good since the begining
the only thing is i don not know if this is waterproof/sweatproof or not , because i sweat a lot when i exercise , so i am kinda afraid if it will ruin the headphone ( it kinda defeats the purpose eh ? ) .
the sportapro has a dirty little secret
the sportaro literally uses the same exact drivers and housing as the ksc35 , but instead of attaching the ksc35 is clips , they attached the sportapro headband
here is my review isnippet' of the which is the same as the sportapro : , the more mature koss that was discontinued and then brought back ( only on the koss website ) , for a pretty hefty $45
i'd say it is hefty because it honestly should cost just slightly above the ksc75 range , not 3x as much
they sound very similar to the ksc75
however , they are fuller sounding , with fuller bass approaching type bass , and the mids/vocals are very rich and forward
treble is also quite neutral for me , not being too smooth , and not too sparkly
i actually am quite fond of their treble
the ksc75 is treble is harsher , grainier , and more fatiguing
the mids on the ksc75 are slightly laid back , while the ksc35 presents them up front and more fleshed out
in all honesty , you can say the difference between the ksc75 and ksc35 is like the difference between the k701 and q701
one is brighter , drier , and thinner sounding , while the other is more natural , and fleshed out
all in all , it is a solid sounding headphone , that does work very well
bass was strong but quick due to the open nature of the headphones , but slower than the ksc75
based on sound alone , i'd say the ksc35 is a headphone you could use for hours without fatigue
kind of like a smaller , more bassy hd650
nice tonal balance that i don not think anyone would dislike
the koss sportapro houses the same drivers as the ksc35 , for less than half the price
you can literally buy the sportapro , snap off the drivers , and snap the ksc75/35 clips on to the sportapro drivers , and you have a cheaper ksc35
ideal solution is getting the sportapro and ksc75 , putting the ksc75 clips onto the sportapro drivers
this will save you $10 , give you both the ksc35 and ksc75 as a spare , and give the most comfort , imho
just make sure to bend the ksc75 clips to place the drivers closer to the ears , as stock form may place the drivers too far , losing bass and overall sound quality
the more popular alternative , is to buy the cheap parts express headphone ( <URL> taking off the crappy drivers , and using the headband for the koss drivers
i prefer the koss clips rather than the parts express headband , but i am in the minority .
pros : fits well
comfortable , not in ear
adjustability has advantages and i can wear a hat with them
cons : not good koss quality sound
sum : good workout phones if you prefer not to stick anything in your ear
recommend but only for niche that it fills .
these koss sportaphones are great
( the name is a bit corny ) comfy on the head in the usual position and in the back of the head setting
they sound very clean , and very clean in the midrange , and have provide some surprising base notes
a great buy the $28
00 !
these are just about the best headphones you can get for ~$25
the entire sound range is great
great response , great bass , clear midrange
gives the original sennheiser ( another excellent headphone ) a run for its money at less than half the price
by the way - the drivers are identical to the famous koss portapro headphones
despite what some claim , the sound between the sportapro and the portapro is identical
i have owned at least <NUM> pairs of each and there is no sound difference between the two
just buy whichever is cheaper .
i know a lot of people have reviewed and liked this product
perhaps it works for them , but i hate it
this set of headphones is already in the garbage
why ? the sound quality is not nearly as good as the reviews led me to believe it would be
i have other headphones with much better sound , but that is not the primary reason that i dumped them
the wire placement for the headphones is in an uncomfortable place - in front of the , so the wires are over my cheeks as they drop down to my ipod
i would rather have the wires toward the back and out of the way
also , i like to drop the wires down the back of my shirt to get them out of the way and hook my ipod onto my belt
the wires on these headphones are too short for this , and with the , the wires cut across my neck when i tried wearing them this way
i have purchased two koss products
i have been disappointed with both
there will not be a third .
the koss headphones ( not ) have been my headphones for more than <NUM> years now , so when i was ordering a new pair recently and saw the i thought i'd give 'em a try for running
while they almost have the detailed imaging of the , they are <PERCENT> percent better in sound quality than my running headphones , the philips shs5200/28
i would give the five stars , except that they aren not quite as comfortable as the philips for extended wear
after an run , i felt that the were pushing a little on the tops of my ears
the headband doesn not really feel secure the "down" position , so i have worn it up
anyway , if koss could take the ear pieces from the and put them on a philips type headband , they'd have an awesome sports headphone ! hint , hint .
i wasn not expecting much but these sound great ! i am no audiophile but i am a speaker junkie and these sound good with jazz and rock
and feel really comfortable on my head
not the coolest looking headset in the world but who cares
i am ripping the speakers out of this and installing them into a motorcycle helmet
they play pretty loud with just my note <NUM> aux out , btw .
i have used an mp3 player with headphones for my workouts for several years now
i cannot use ear bud types because they just fall out when i move
i don not want to buy expensive over the ear headphones just to sweat all over them but quality inexpensive over the ear headphones seemed impossible to find
the koss sportapro is the best choice i have made yet at under <NUM> dollars
they sound great and the band style along with the pivoting ear pieces keeps them in place
the band pivots for the or style
i find the to be a little awkward , probably because i am not used to it , but they do stay in place , which is great for
i have read that some find them to be ugly but i could care less what they look like and frankly cannot understand that criticism
i highly recommend these headphones for anyone that needs headphones while exercising or any activity .
on the plus side , these have great , rich sound
they also grip the head well so they work for exercise
on the negative side : they are seriously fugly
like people will look at you funny ugly
also the istrap' that goes around the back is not a strap
it is steel
the length is adjustable ( though it can pull hair when you adjust ) , but it is rigid and doesn not really work in the "around the back" position ( in the picture )
so i ended up wearing it in the "over the top of the head" position which worked fine but it is not what i wanted
if you don not care how they look at all and you want seriously good sound , these are a good buy
otherwise i'd recommend you keep looking
i am .
i tried this for the first time at work
inmediatly bought one
they are lightweight , excelent of running , great bass .
the koss sportapro headphones are terrific
they are lightweight and can be worn over or behind your head as described
these phones are fully adjustable for different head sizes
the cord is <NUM> feet long
sound quality is fabulous
when you consider the low price , these headphones are a truly an amazing bargin
you cannot go wrong with this one
highly recommended .
i love koss headhones
i had a pair from long ago and they are not adjustable the way this pair is
i ordered now pads for my earpieces on the old set and ordered this one because it sounded like maybe it would fit better when i wore a hat
while they work as advertised and god knows the price is fantastic as well as the warranty , they just aren not as comfortable as i thought they would be
when wearing them as behind the neck , the pads/speakers seem to slip around a bit
i still like them , just wish my head was shaped a bit different to make them a bit more comfortable .
only headphone i have used
very comfortable
highs and midrange are very nice however i expected more bass ( may be an ear fit issue )
i also expected a more compact
otherwise , i am very happy with them .
with a name like "sportapro" i assumed they'd be pretty good for , you know , sporty things , like jogging
when in position , they tend to drift a bit
you have to get the band exactly right , since that is the only thing holding them up - the band resting on your neck
also , i am not saying these things need a manual , but a small piece of paper with little arrows showing which way the things can fold on the headphones will be nice
they are a lot more adjustable than most headphones , but it is not immediately obvious
for the price , they sound really good
despite the drift i have been using them for over a year and have no plans on switching .
these admittedly headphones give surprisingly good sound
bass is full and the rest of the frequency spectrum is nothing to sneeze at
since statistically speaking you are like most people , you will be plugging these into either an mp3 player full of , compressed audio tracks or else a crummy portable cd player with an extremely noisy potentiometer for a volume control
buying better than these perfectly respectable headphones would be a waste of money
the sportapros fold up too , which makes them great for a coat pocket
also , the headband can fold in such a way that the headphones look like &quot ; &quot ; headphones that are these days
this makes them clamp on your head a bit more , but it can not possibly be any less comfortable than any other headphones in such a configuration
i think it looks stupid that way , but hey , if that is your cup of tea so be it
as for noise isolation , these don not offer much
if you really don not want to hear the subway along with your gangsta rap , you should be looking at a pair of phones or better yet headphones such as those made by etymotics
( the latter are a few times the price of the sportapros on the bottom end , mind you
) it even comes with a fake leather bag that i keep laundry money in
( keeping a set of headphones this inexpensive in such a bag is just screaming &quot ; i have ocd ! &quot ; ) bottom line , this is the best pair of portable headphones you can buy for the price
they don not sound worse than the sennheisers in this price range , for example , and they are quite a bit smaller .
i have been using sportapros for over <NUM> years
i have gone through <NUM> pairs ( i am pretty rough on them
) the sound response is excellent for the price and they fit great ( and tight ) for when you are training/working out/etc
also , you don not look like one of these fools with huge dj headphones on their heads .
they stick to my head pretty well while working out at the gym
the foam is a bit coarse , so it is scratchy
i don not think i could wear them all afternoon at a football game , but the bass is excellent , great motivator when doing those situps during a <NUM> min workout
i would buy them again .
for the money , these are the best headphones you can get
they have strong bass , are loud , and the sound quality is great
they are pretty sturdy , i have owned <NUM> pairs , and they have held up to gym use and throwing them in a backpack most of the time
the only thing i suggest is buying some extra pads , they tend to get sweaty and i like to change them out so they can dry properly
i have ripped one , but replacements are cheap
don not waste money on more expensive headphones , buy these and enjoy them for years to come .
i love these headphones in behind the head mode ( especially now that i know the earpieces can rotate )
in mode i find the band a little tight
it works , but the earphones barely cover my ears
i have a large head , and doubt most people will have any discomfort using this in mode
but i will likely be using it in behind the head mode even when i am not outside wearing a hat , just because it is more comfortable .
i am not an expert as much as the others posting here , all i know is that my original ipod earbuds were quite uncomfortable
i replaced them with this sportapro and played joni mitchell is "hejira' on my ipod and it sounded stellar
do be careful handling these as they seem less than rugged .
i bought these on sale and took a chance after reading some reviews on them
they really sound great for their size
my main headphones are a set of grado which sound amazing but these sound very close
the headband is adjustable
the fit is good if you use the band over your head
the behind the head use seems to not fit too comfortably for me and when i put it on that way the bad ripped a hair out of my head
i use these with my 40gb fourth generation ipod
they have a lifetime warranty and i use my headphones for working out and go through a new pair every <NUM> months
save your receipt ! they can sound a little bassy but i like that in a work out headphone especially since ipods really lack good bass
excellent for almost any kind of music except classical .
i have always preferred behind the neck headphones and have been willing to sacrifice a little sound quality for smaller headphones
with these , there is no trade off
they sound great with excellent response and rich bass that isn not overbearing
they weigh almost nothing and are very comfortable on my somewhat oversized head
as for looks and styling
they sound great ! then again , if your headphone purchase is based on &<HASHTAG> ; fashion&<HASHTAG> ; , the help you desperately need won not be found in product reviews .
i do like the sound , and the and design is handy
i have trouble getting them positioned comfortably when i am wearing glasses , though
it can be done , but it is troublesome
i think i will get used to them
yep , they are ugly , but we know that from the photo , and i didn not deduct stars for that .
got the original portapros back in the early 80s and been using the successive variants ever since
nothing beats these for performance vs
i am a picky listener ( mostly classical ) and have gone through way too much money buying stereo equipment of all types since the 1960s but these little headphones from koss have been great ever since the type was introduced
get some , you will be pleased .
koss does it again- i will never purchase another brand is headphones , ever
my last <NUM> have all been koss and these have held up great
i also got a set of portapros for casual wear
love koss !
these $20 headphones sound as good or better than many that cost much more
i also think they will be more durable
only two downsides* they are not pretty* they don not really fit in the included casestill , they are my favorite portable headphones .
these are possible some of the best knock around headphones i have had ! if there is a contender for the it is the sport -a - pros ! these headphones are great and very versatile !
i have been using these for years
excellent sound quality for the price -- far , far better than other portable headphones i have tried
excellent midrange and treble clarity , with pretty accurate bass
a lot of cheap headphones in this price range have horrible , boomy bass
not these
sound quality degrades a bit at extremely high volume ; if you want to listen to music that loudly , get earbuds instead
can be worn with the band either or flipped back in a wraparound configuration
( this looks a little goofy , but does hold the headphones in place just fine
) if you don not like the looks , the "portapro" model has the exact same drivers
the only real problem i have had is that after a while , the little foam pieces that help hold the headphones in place can tear off , and they are not easily replaceable
koss has a lifetime warranty and will replace them under rma , but it is a bit of a pain shipping them back .
i wanted these phones because they are supposed to work as behind the head or on top of the head
turned out that when used behind the head , they were a little uncomfortable , so i use them with the band on top
not exactly what i expected , but they are ok and the sound is good .
very comfortable with good sounds high through low
they do cut out at anything <NUM> hz or below
so hip hop will be thin in the lower range
jazz , roxk , classical , and more
they are very comgfortable and snug
great for walking , beach with tablet or phone
these sound very , very good
most "mini" headphones are lacking in either lows , mids or highs
these have all frequency ranges covered
at first i could not figure out how they were supposed to work in mode
i tried it every which way , but they were always either awkward or loose
i couldn not believe they promoted these as headphones when they were so
but i did some googling , and discovered something that is not shown in the packaging or the enclosed manual : the headband pivots
so what you do is , put the headphones on the top of your head so that it is comfortable ; hold the ear pieces in place on your ears ; then push the headband toward the back of your head with your index fingers
this way the ear pieces fit exactly the way they do when the headband is on top of your head , except the headband goes around the back of your head instead of the top
it is very comfortable and they fit securely
( they are actually not phones , they are phones
) this may be common knowledge , but i didn not see it in any of the reviews i read , though i did see complaints about how they don not work behind the neck .
the sportapros along with the ksc35 is and the portapros all use the same wonderful drivers
you can expect very nice frequency response in an affordable comfortable form factor that does not stick into your ear like buds ( no ear canal fitting issues and you are still able to hear what is going on around you depending on volume for safety )
i have all three of the models listed above and love them all
the sportapros are by far the value item of the three because they sell for <PERCENT> less for the same sound quality
i have had the ksc35 is and portapros for years with no issues what so ever
register your phones for the lifetime warranty ! the other day my little kid busted the ear clicp on the ksc35 is
i call koss and explained i need to "buy" the ear clip part because my kid was rough housing the phones
they said "no we don not sell the parts
will will just ship them to you for free"
the whole call took <NUM> minutes of my time
the clip arrived three days later .
i got a pair of portapros , ksc75s and these to see how the sound is in each of them when they are supposed to have the same driver
and to be fair , i was confused
each headset has it is own distinct feature and advantage
very frankly speaking , the portapro is price is what i believe koss cashing in on the hype , since frankly speaking i do not see the <PERCENT> increase in any way
that being said , the portapros do sound the best of the lot , because it feels like it has a slightly wider soundstage
i guess that is since the sportapros have a solid plastic plate almost covering the speakers , hence kind of "closing" it up a bit
the ksc75 have it in them to sound as good as these two , but the lack of any pressure to hold the speakers closer to the ear result in most of the sound leaking out , hence the huge drop in bass
press the speakers close to the ears with your hand and you will get what i mean
comfortwise , i would say the ksc75s win by a mile
you won not even feel that you have a pair of earphones on
the pads are good , comfy , and the same for all the three , but here the lack of pressure on the ears plays to the advantage of the ksc75s
sportapros definitely look odd
the ksc75s look uglier
love the design idea of the sportapro though , the conversion to a fit is genius , and definitely a worthy option given the metal band of both sportapro and portapro being always hungry for the hair follicles around it
the portas and the sportas both come with a nice faux leather pouch , in which you can curl both of them in to a cute little ball and toss in
the sportas came with a nice gold plated 3
5cm to 1/4" adapter as well
packaging wise , portapro is miles aahead of the rest ( well they are almost twice as expensive as the sportapros ! )
the ksc75s do not have any bells and whistles in the pack , but then again it is almost 1/3rd the price of portas
the only concern in any of the three headphones was the adapter of the ksc75s , which do not have any protective ridging for the wires coming out of it , make me skeptical about the longevity of the connection
but seriously kudos to koss for making some of the best headphones i have heard in my life and at prices the others can only go green on .
pros : bass is amazing , mid range sounds like your right there in thegreat pair of phones for the price i believe
high range sounds incredible
feels light and comfortable
keeps you connected with surroundings
comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha i can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear , and no pressure from the loudness
just more juicy
cons : a little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head
a little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head
no instructions on which way to wear the phones .
these are great ! many over the ear phones don not allow for much adjustment for head size , but these can accommodate a wider range than most
in addition , each ear cup can swivel independently
i have used them for many years now , primarily while running
they fold up somewhat for storage
i have owned several of them , and only once did one go bad--a wire going into the cups came loose
hours of sweat on the foam cups hasn not hurt them
i can not speak about sound quality , because of all the noise i generate running and breathing gets in the way of fine discrimination
they fit , they last , they are comfortable .
much sturdier than the porta pros , which i have had and used for a couple years
to me , the sound is exactly the same as the porta pros , but i admit i do not hear very well
that doesn not mean i can not tell the difference between a crappy pair of headphones and a good pair , but between the two pros there is no discernible difference to me in audio quality
these however look much nicer i think , and appear as though they will last a lot longer too
of course they come with lifetime warranty , so when they break down ( which my porta pros often did ) just mail them to the company on the box with $6 and they will send you a replacement pair pretty quickly .
i have the portapro , which i bought when it was selling for $50
the sound is incredible for something in this price range , but i feel embarrassed using it in public , even though savvy audiophiles know it is cool
so i got the sportapro
it is sounds as good
but it is not quite as embarrassing to wear
update : after nearly a month of use , i can say that not only am i pleased with the sportapro , i favor it over the portapro
while the sound quality between the two is about equal , i find the sportapro to be more comfortable , especially for wearing for a long duration
i have addressed the aesthetics , but i will reiterate that i feel a bit embarrassed when i wear the portapro , in contrast to the sportapro .
i did lots of research before i purchased these headphones
many of the reviews said the sportapro offered great sound , deep bass , and wide range
well , i have not been disappointed
although i am not an audio expert , i am impressed with the range of these headphones ; the sound is as good or better than headphones costing $60 or more
they are pretty small , comfortable , and they are collapsible , so they are easy to carry when on the road
some reviewers have remarked that they are ugly
i don not wear headphones to make a fashion statement , and frankly , although these aren not great looking , i don not think they are that bad either
also , there is no longer a mute switch on these headphones
apparently , they were causing problems ( a short ) so koss removed this feature
overall , i am very satisfied with this purchase .
* update 1/21/11 * i have found that the design is not a problem at all with my workout
i have change my rating to as the sound is absolutely terrific
compare very favorably if not better than my portapros and sennheiser hd238 is
i should have read the reviews more carefully and i would have seen that these are in face a double cord input and not single like i wanted
the picture does not indicate this at all , nor is it specified in the description
dual may technically be better for sound than single , but for my purposes it is awkward
i primarily use a rowing machine which means i place my player down on the floor next to me while using , then the rower has quite a bit of forward/back motion
the dual cords hanging down in the middle make this very cumbersome , and the cord also winds up being too short , i will at least need an extender
i haven not played much with the fit , but it does seem that is much more comfortable than trying to wear these behind the neck
that is ok with me but i would have preferred the other
they seem to sound good , and for the price i haven not risked much , but had i known the design i would have kept looking
i will try these for awhile but i may not be able to use them for my purposes at all .
strait out of the packaging i hooked them up to my hdcd denon player
overall , they have got good highs and mids
the 6khz treble region could be a little more pleasantly recessed than it is , but the never gets fatiguing at normal volumes - only when loud
i must say that the bass is a little exaggerated
it is noticeably overdone in the region -- the lowest you can pretty much hear with headphones
this never *seems* to muddle the mids , which is often a problem with phones
it doesn not seem excessively boomy and there are oodles of dynamics , which i did not expect
they remind me a lot of the denon 950 is , but without the denon is highs
when i hooked them up to my panasonic 361c portable , i was surprised even further
with curve : doppelganger , the bass didn not seem even the slightest bit exaggerated
unfortunately , when i moved over to extreme intensive music like massive attack : mezzanine , there was still a little too much bass , but slightly less than on the denon
econoline crush : the devil you know kind of had too much bass , but most people would probably prefer it that way
yet , on many cd is bass is noticeably overdone
spatially , the sportapros have a nice open sound
the sportapros fold up and this is where the other caveat comes out
when using the headband behind your head , the little hook can start rubbing against my head , behind my right ear
this only happens when the band slides too far down , though
all koss had to do was have the hook facing the opposite direction to avoid this
they are still the most comfortable that i have ever tried , and i do love how they fold up ; it returns them to a nice , taught shape
the koss has a good , short length of cord for portable use that also has a mute button on it
i will keep the sportapros as a portable and alternative
if used with bass turned down a tad , they would be even better
wires are not superior
they allow out of phase to enter the opposite ear through the shared ground wire , which is why audiophile headphones are almost always
the classic sony v6 , for instance , has a problem and is unsuitable for binaural applications because of this .
i like the koss sportpro headphones
they sound very good for this price range
they are well made and comfortable
at this price , they are a great value .
these are great for running or doing outdoor activities without being bulky
they sound great and are easy to wear and to store
i highly recommend for lightweight headphones , and they don not fall out of your ears like always do
good product !
worked and sounded pretty good for a few months , then the sound became distorted and every bit of bass was missing
i am now shopping for a quality replacement for them
-very disappointed in koss
this product koss sportapro stereo headphones , is excelent , sounds great and it , s very affordable for the price that i paid for it , i recommend it very much .
i took a chance based on other reviews , and was not dissapointed
these provide great sound , especilly for the price
i may consider the closed ear type for noisy coditions , now that i know the sound is great .
i use headphones for running outside ( not treadmill )
i am a big fan of neckband headphones , ( don not use ear buds ) as i have used sony is discontinued g57 is and philips discontinued headphones as well
first , these are sold to be versatile to be worn as neckbands if you want but they are uncomfortable , and are not neckband replacements if that is what you truly want
i wear them over my head , and when i put them on , the metal pinches my head when it adjusts for size
the reason i kept them was for the sound
they are awesome
they are more but great for outdoors
even though they are bigger than most neckbands , they are still light weight
if koss would get these on a traditional neckband frame , i would give it five stars easy
my old sony is almost had as good sound , but the neckband and comfort ( light weight and snug fit over ears ) still make them my favorite compared to the koss .
we researched many head phones and decided on either bose or koss sportapro stereo headphones
while shopping on ebay we found a pair of bose at a reasonable price
we purchased them , but even though we paid immediately , the seller chose not to ship the product
we did recover our money , but in the meantime thought we would give the sportapro a try
i never did get to compare the bose with the portapro , but these head phones give an awesome sound
not being an audiophile i simply enjoy a great sound
they work well with a lenova laptop without a sophisticated sound card , and the sound is much better than my sony rack system
when i use these headphones , the sound is very strong and all bass and treble notes are both clear and well balanced
recommend these and the comparative price makes a good value
you don not really need to spend $200 when you can get a high quality unit like the koss
am buying some more of these for some grand kids .
i have tried many other types of headphones , all more expensive , but no others come close as far as comfort and value for exercise or travel
lifetime warranty on these also
can not go wrong !
i bought these phones based on the large number of very positive reviews here ; i just received them , and am not disappointed
i got them to use with my rio <NUM> mp3 player , which came with unuseable koss earbuds ( the foam coverings fell off every time you put it in your ear
they were also innefficient -- not loud enough )
the sportaphones sound excellent -- very smooth highs , efficient enough for good volume , and deep bass
my only complaint is a little overemphasis in the , but this can be fixed with the rio 500 is eq settings
the sportaphones are pretty comfortable , although i can not see ever using them in the position
the band forces them against your ears which will always help bass reproduction in phones
on the down side , this could cause fatigue after long periods
they fold up , quite ingeniously , to a very small package , and the leatherette bag plus gold connectors are nice extras
i don not know what the fuss is about their looks -- i don not think they are particularly ugly , and least on my head
i guess if you are ugly to begin with , the phones won not improve your looks ! ; - ) in conclusion , they are a great bargain for the price
i hope they hold up ; maybe i will get a spare pair just in case .
great portable headphones for the price
well balanced sound , nice mix of treble and bass , not too much of either , just right
build quality is okay , i am not a fan of the metal headband , but overall they seem like they will last for a good while .
i have bought <NUM> pairs of sporta pros during the last <NUM> years
( nothing wrong with the quality , just i like to have one pair at home , one pair at office and another pair stuffed in my backpack ) it looks fragile and sometimes ugly
but what really counts is the sound
the characteristics of the sound are : clean , warm , dynamic ( overs a wide range from low to high ) , very good sensitivity ( very loud at normal volume setting ) , lots of bass ( although a little boomy at times )
the first time when you hear it you will be surprise for its powerful bass
i hate the mute button but i heard recently koss had taken it off
for protable use it is probably the best in its price class
some people complain about the comfortability issue , i have no problem wearing it for hours though
for more serious listening , i would highly recommend a pair of grado sr60 ( open style )
it is about $70 and i couldn not believe how much pleasure i had taken from listening to it
the highs are crystal clear , the bass is good but not boomy at all ( you can feel it ) , the warm , open mid range is simply seductive
the transparency and spacious of the sound stage is amazing
it stirs up your feelings and emotions when listening to most vocal , classic and pop music
it is pity that amazon
com doesn not carry this headphone , truely a gem in the protable headphone family
another pair ( closed style , around $ ) i could recommend is sony is
good frequency range , very good bass , very clean sound and very little coloration of sound
however unlike the grado , the sound is flat although maybe more accurate
i will describe the sound as "scientific" comparing with grado is "emotional" and "liveness" .
these are by far the best headphones i have ever used
agreed they look kinda awkward and arent marvelously comfortably if worn for extended periods of time , but the sounds completely makes up for all that
the bass is perfect
great treble and mids
no complaint what so ever .
i bought these from an affiliate seller as i live close to them here in nyc and i was able to save a few $$
these are great headphones but if you are expecting to block out all other noise , forget it
the way these are designed you are still able to hear what is going on around you which here in nyc is a good thing
you still hear the music which comes through loud and clear
i was hearing subtle notes and tones with these even through the surrounding street noise which i never did with my cheapo colby headset which did a good job of blocking out noise when playing music
there is good tension on the metal headband but the way this is designed with foam rests make for a very comfortable fit
i have worn these for a number of hours straight with glasses without any discomfort
this has a straight plug which i like as it does not interfere with the case for my iphone 3g
when a call comes in i just unplug the headphone and move the speaker off of my ear
i do not have to worry about breaking these as they are of a solid construction
even if they did break , koss provides a lifetime warranty though the cost of shipping is about <PERCENT> of what i paid
if these ever do break i may just buy a different pair but who knows
to sum up , these are probably the best bang for your buck for over the head phones
they are not pretty though so if you are more concerned with looks than with good sound go buy something else .
i bought these based on good reviews like above
the treble detail is good and the bass is solid and warm
not tight and detailed based like from my sennheiser 580 is but those cans cost ~$200
only issue i have with them is that the earpieces swivel on a small plastic joint that tends to get looser over time
eventually , they start falling out a lot
nice sounding phones but won not take huge amounts of abuse .
i loved these headphones from the very first day
i can not say i ever really needed to use the band behind the head trick , but for the sonic quality they deliver , the warranty they offer , the flexibility to switch the headband position , and the price you pay for the deal , these deserve <NUM> stars ! i own these since around and i just recently started hearing some rattling in the right ear channel
no problem - sent them out to be repaired by koss , for a marginal cost of shipping they were returned to me with new membranes , a new cord , and new cushions , plus a thank you note ! these beat a lot of other headphones i have owned
plenty of kickin bass and pure crystal clear highs
good mids too
a word of caution : the headband is not for giant heads , but should fit just fine for most
recommended .
i purchased the koss sportapro headphones to use with my ipod nano
i was surprised with the overall sound quality
the sound responsiveness is very good
the main reason i did not rate them a <NUM> is they are not quite as comfortable as i would like
i use them while i exercise , and i find that i have to adjust them for comfort long before i am done .
excellent sound quality
fits well over the head or from behind
lifetime warranty also .
koss is still making great products
i have been buying koss for over <NUM> years , and i have no complaints
got these for my college son
he says they work great
they go on top of the ear , which my son likes that better than the ear inserts
they fold up into a neat little case .
the sound : better than many portables , but a bit bassy with a corresponding loss of treble
still not the perfect phone , especially when i am used to the sony / , which emphasize the treble slightly while having the full sound you get from a good headphone
my sony is are also more efficient--they are louder
ps , i wish i could find the cans that came with aiwa portable tape players a few years ago
they were great , and you could hear the cymbals dancing clearly
the look : somewhat ugly plastic form
the headband : can be bent down to go behind your head to keep your gel in style
still stays on
i liked the sonys for this and their great look , but their sound was atrocious and they were less comfortable
the pressure : the extra pads just above your ears take most of the pressure holding them on your head , so they stay on and don not press your ears too much
the button : yes , it has a mute button on the cord , but it is too low , at the waistband if you are 5'-6" and sitting in your chair , and when you cross your arms the music cuts out
the plug : has a regular and mini combo plug
the bag : you get a leatherette bag to put them in
the size : they close up flat into a 6" x 4" area for storage .
i did not expect much
i thoight to myself , what should i expect for less then $25 a pair
oh my god , with the correct persoonal ajustments to your mp3 player , the sound is no less then awesome
the sound is clear as a beel right accross the spectrum
if you are not careful , the bass wil completely blow you away
i have ear phones that cost upwards of $300 + and they do not come close
they are comfortable and stay on your head at the gym not matter what part of the circut you are on
buy them and then buy some more ! i am not kidding after i finish wring this review , i am going to order two more pair
oh yes , buy the extra foam .
i bought this unit from amazon over ayear ago and the reason was i felt the price was good and with al the tapes i make i wanted some control over the sound quality
the unit is okay but has some klitches
currently i am running my md player/recorder and my dual cassett deck through this unit to my receiver
it allows me to do this because it will acommodate two tape decks as well , i might add , tv or audio visual
these are important features if you are using last years model receiver with no md input
you can really impact ont eh bass midrange and the high notes with this unit it has the goods what is difficault is that the buttons stick and as a consequence you have to manipulate them to make sure they are all the way in or all the way out
before i figured this out i thouhgt the unit was broke and put it in the garbage
i couldn not just pitch and it is a good thing because when i got an md recorder and realized i needed a way to attach it to my stereo i started playing around with the unit and discovered the stiky button problem
now i am just recording away and am pleased
like anything in this life there are ups and down points
if you have some patience and want great bass or more difined midrange or aweet highs even playing with annoying buttons makes this unit worth the price
if you are looking for some eye candy with your music or audio , then i recommend this eq/meter
it is really alot of fun to watch your music and/or movies come to life
it is definitely a conversation starter
that said , the audio input and output to analog only
therefore if you have digital audio , you need to get a converter
overall , a fun purchase if you are looking for a light show .
i just received my unit - purchased directly from the manufacturer at a better price than amazon
i was a bit apprehensive based on all the reviews that i have read on amazon but i also didn not want to spend a whole lot of money on my pioneer stereo ( circa 1985 )
it was easy to setup and connected my cd and turntable within minutes
i was puzzled the lack of sound from my turn table but thankfully i had an turn table amp that i purchased from amazon ( see that review ) a few years back , connected it and records play wonderfully
i do not have issues that others have reported , like i said , it sounds great and it was easy to setup
i would say this is a great buy .
it looks a bit more expensive than just a cheap analog stereo graphic equalizer
no audiophile quality here , just an easy eq solution for your power amp .
i decided to get the audiosource eq stereo graphic equalizer in spite of the many reviews expressing dislikes from unhappy customers
i wanted one , especially after my old technics graphic equalizer had given up the ghost ! the sound was ok , but it just wasn not sounding like it did before the old equalizer died ! with this new unit , it helps give the sound coming from your headphones and speakers that extra kick which also give a tremendous boost to the bass & highs ! the dazzling spectrum analyzer display give the appearance of dancing christmas lights ! you can just sit and watch the display lights dance across the whole spectrum as you listen to your favorite kind of music ! my old technics unit was good , but it didn not have the display
just the buttons that light up in red
there are buttons near the bottom on the front panel for power , tape <NUM> & 2 , audio/video , eq bypass , eq record and line/tape
two small knobs for adjusting the sound level for left & right channels
when the unit is turned on , the power button lights up in green
in the off position , it lights up in red and stays that way until it is pressed again to turn the unit back on
getting it hooked up was like the major obstacle course ! at first there was no audio for about <NUM> or <NUM> tries
then i thought about sending it back until i hooked up the audio cables , and then , the audio worked perfectly ! all in all , i think that it is a great addition to anyone is stereo system ! i just hope that no problems develop with it
~daquan13 .
this equiptment does require a solid speaker/amp set up
this will give you the capability to blow out cheaper speakers due to a lack of internal limiting circuitry
not a complaint at all though
the range on this thing is very good , also allows you to eq recordings you make to cd , tape or mp3 if desired
made the music sound much bigger and sharper
especially feeling my cd is were flat in sonic output
if not desired , the bypass button will stop this effect with a single touch
mine was built a year or so ago , sat around in it is box and yes , got "sticky" before it was sold
i quickly resolved this by blowing dust with aerosol out while pushing the buttons in and out
not a problem since
smooth operation that doesn not impart a "click" onto your recorded media when reproducing and fine tuning things live
plated plugs and a turntable ground wire in the rear all plusses aswell
quite pleased , gonna buy another .
this product does not work
i purchased this product to replace a faulting adc <NUM> equalizer
this was the only choice on the market
after getting the unit i was able to connect it quite simple in to my system
i have a dbx unit for my reel to reel and had to connect it directly to the reel to reel , not much of a problem
but then the problem started to unfold
first the buttons , they are confusing , and don not work half the time
then i noticed that i could not monitor tape recording output from three head deck and dbx record monitoring
with the eq connected to a deck that monitors it seem to short the input to the output , causing the input level control not to respond , not distortion but not good for you tape deck
after that i started tested a different configurations
i have a <NUM> head deck , so i connected it to the eq <NUM> and it worked okay , but still had problems with the buttons happened again
i then connected the reel to reel without dbx , direct bypass the monitor loop and it worked okay for the first few times , then all of a sudden i could not record on the reel to reel , the input controls didnot work and the signal to the meters were pegged , not good , then i losted the <NUM> head deck
powered off everything and tried again
after several reset everything worked again
so i decided to give this unit one more try , by adding one piece at a time and testing one piece one piece at a time
i added the three head deck ( teac v711 ) , to tape1 , then tested , worked okay for a while and then things started not working
remember this is just <NUM> tape deck ! connected
powered off all components and things went back to working
i said okay maybe it is me let me read the manual more closely
figured out the button ( tape 1>2/tape2&lt ; 1 ) button depends on the setting of the ( audio/video ) button and also the ( line/tape ) button so to listen to tape deck <NUM> you must have tape1>2 + audio/video + line/tape led green
okay that worked , only for about and hour and then same problem happen , input controls stop working and meter pegged and again this is just <NUM> tape deck connected !
what i have found out after opening the unit and putting it on a oscilloscope , i found that the contacts in the switches are very poorly made and are solider to close together and are causing electrical interference
when a button is depressed and testing the contacts on the oscilloscope showed a little ambient noise -75dbm level , which is okay , but as you use the switch the noise level increases until it shorts , that is why when you power off and let the unit sit and power back on it works okay that is kind of a electrical discharge so to speak and the ambient noise is back to around -70 ~ -75dbm
the open circuit test fluctuated from inf to 10k ohm resistance
closed circuit test revealed from <NUM> ~ <NUM> ohm resistance on average but fluctuated to inf at times
that why the sound cuts out and the input shorts to the output
so all in all the unit went back for a refund
please don not buy this unit
it is low quality and poor craftsmanship that it will not last more than a month or so
it does not support tape monitoring , and don not try to connect a three head deck it will short out your deck
the buttons don not work and short constantly
tape to tape dubbing is limited to only monitoring source , that is correct , when dubbing you can only list to the source tape and not the dubbing tape to insure that the deck is recording okay
this is a very poor design !
buying an equalizer seems kind of retro these days , but i still have a good cassette dual deck and have recently purchased a reel to reel again
used to have one years ago
now use both of these for fun and the occassional uploading of music from the old formats to my media center computer
the equalizer acts as a hook up device to have both decks on my stereo which is then hooked to my computer
it allows for some sound enhancing along with the computer .
i read another review on here complaining about the "sticky buttons" on the audio source eq 200
after reading another review saying their unit worked fine with no button problems , i decided to take a chance , hoping that the other reviewer is button problem was an isolated incident
wishful thinking
i have had the eq <NUM> for about a week and the same problem showed up on mine
i was listening to an old album on my turntable when one of the stereo channels just cut out
at first i thought it might be a loose cable , or worse , a problem with the cartridge on my turntable
then i remembered the review about the "sticky buttons
" sure enough , i went to the eq and jiggled the buttons , and the sound cut in and out as i did so
after jiggling them a few times the problem went away for a while , then it out of nowhere started acting up again
it is not so much that they "stick , " as it is that they just plain don not work properly
the have a "cheap" feel to them ; all the switches appear to be mounted to a single flimsy bracket
when you press one switch you can see the adjacent ones move
besides the fact they don not work , they are confusing and limited the way they are formatted
they don not let you monitor the tape deck is output when recording ; something that should be a standard feature of an eq
the buttons on my old radio shack/optimus eq made a lot more sense in how they operated for dubbing/monitoring
there are a couple other annoyances on the audio source , too
the analyzer display has no sensitivity adjustment ; when i play my cd player , the display is just maxed out
you can adjust the display by turning down the input level knobs , but i only want to turn down the display , not the volume ! the "0" line on the eq should be a different color for easily identifying the relative position of the sliders , but it is simply white like all the lines , which makes it difficult to easily identify the center line
if i were keeping the unit , i would take care of this problem with a magic marker
there are also no scale markings on the input level control knobs , leaving you to guess as to when you have the left and right balanced
the sound quality seems decent when it works , but what good is a stereo component if the sound cuts out while you are listening to your music ? the illuminated sliders and spectrum analyzer look neat , but hey , i don not buy a stereo component just for looks
seeing as other people have complained of the same button issue , i am sure audio source has to be aware of the problem
obviously , they are not going to invest the resources to correct the problem on something as obsolete as a graphic equalizer
it is too bad , since this model seems to be pretty much the only eq left on the market for a home stereo
the only other eq i found other than professional models for systems , was a teac model which doesn not have as many inputs as the audio source
i am returning the audio source for a full refund ; no sense having them send me another one when undoubtedly it will have the same defect
i guess i will try my luck with the teac , either that or put up with the muddy sound my stereo has without an eq
i will just have to do the old cable swapping routine if i want to do any dubbing with the teac .
had this and now have an art <NUM> eq for $99
no comparison ! art is actually dj/real quality with unbalanced rca jacks for home use as well as the balanced jacks for pro use
, high quality potentiometers , discrete with output control , clipping indicators , <NUM> or <NUM> db scale select for each channel
ground lift select for possible source grounding problems
just need to buy <NUM> rubber adhesive feet for home shelf mounting , rather than rack mounting
comes without feet and rack ears for 19" rack
much nicer eq than this audio source junk , and i have owned both .
what an awesome camera -- i can not say enough good about this camera
it is so user friendly that we purchased it for my 70+ year old parents for christmas , and they are already using it to sell things at online auction sites
resolution is excellent , ease of use is exceptional , and you cannot beat the convenience of just popping a disk into your computer and pulling up the images -- why would anyone waste their time ( and more importantly their money ) on those digital cameras with dumb &quot ; smart cards&quot ; that require cabling into your computer and all kinds of fancy software
the sony comes with respectable software , but i highly recommend purchasing picture it software -- it is ideal for use with this camera
if i had one criticism it would be about storage space - the floppies don not hold as many pictures as i'd like , but it is really not a big issue unless you are going out somewhere with the intention of taking a lot of pictures and plowing through them later ( in which case you just need to take some spare floppies with you )
truly a camera you will buy and be enjoying immediately .
yep , it is big and heavy
but this is the camera i keep coming back to after having it <NUM> years
i have owned an hp and a casio
the hp stunk and the casio is a tiny delight
but the sony was my first
it simply works
not every computer around has card slots and having a camera that uses floppy disks has been helpful
it is especially good for pictures for ebay and email
good quality photos with a small file size
so , if you see a good looking , working specimen go ahead and buy it and give digital photography a try !
this camera has a lot going for it
the first picture i took turned out great ! the camera is very user friendly which is good because the manual that sony provides is not very well organized or well written
i find the floppy disk storage to be easy and convenient
the camera allows you to make a copy of the disk right in the camera so you can share copies of photos with friends on the spot
the mpeg movies are a fun little add on
i am taking the camera to england in april and i think it will be fun to capture little movie clips over there
the rechargeable battery seems to be adequate
i am planning to purchase the more powerful one that provides longer charge
the video and audio cables provided allow easy viewing of the photos on the tv set
the only negatives with the camera are the difficulty holding the view steady when the zoom is on ( but no other digital camera maker provides a zoom this powerful ) also , the light that leaks out of the window at the top of the lcd screen
this can be annoying in a dark room
overall , this camera delivered the features that i was looking for .
i cannot tell you how wonderful this camera is ! you have to have one ! it will change your life in so many ways--the photos are wonderful with great resolution , movies are exquisitely wonderful ! the sound is just fine
i love using the diskettes
the lithium battery is great also--lasts a long , long time prior to recharge ! all problems of older digital cameras have been solved with this lovely piece of technological work .
after carefully studying the features , using them inside thestore , and viewing the pictures on one of their display pcs i washappiest with the high resolution photos that the produced as well as it is special effect is capability
i also appreciated the lack of legacy adapters and wires
its use of standard 3
5 floppies is great
you will be hard pressed to find a computer without a floppy disk now or in the future
i worked up the courage to buy it , i have been using it for several months now , and i have no regrets
a couple friends have some of the newer kodak , agfa , and olympus models and they are all disappointed with theirs compared to the
the disk writes pretty fast and you can get usually <NUM> or <NUM> highest quality photos per disk
movie resolution is good for pc and web use , but , its <NUM> sec or <NUM> sec recording limit can be a little limiting
i bought this camera before leaving for a long stay in japan , where i did lots of backpacking , hiking , and traveling by train or hitchhiking
i liked the light body - it was easy to carry around and didn not weigh down my bag much at all
naturally the camera got banged around quite a bit , and i even dropped it in its bag a few times
however , even though it was abused enough for the filter to crack , and i had to the view mirrors when i returned , the camera kept working with absolutely no problems , through all of the <NUM> photographs i took
the pictures quality was excellent
i didn not have problems with graininess , and i'd guess that the reviewers used <NUM> film
automatic focus was plenty fast
actually , i ended up being lazy and using the automatic features most of the time , but with few exceptions , the results were about what i'd expect
if i had to do it again , i'd get a lens with more zoom , but that is more personal preference than anything - the included lens worked fine
i strongly recommend using a filter , to protect the lens from scratches and damage .
i have had such a great time learning to use this camera and taking photos
i used it immediately , switching the dial to automatic and letting it do everything
it was exactly like a point and shoot
but when i learned how to adjust aperture and shutter speed , i took even better photos
i highly recommend this camera
i took it to alaska in august and people said how beautiful and crisp my photos were
if you have the money , also invest in a telefoto lens
sometimes 80mm just isn not long enough
but you can always add that later .
great camera , great condition like new
it takes amazing photographs and is easy to handle and work with
the price was very low considering the great quality photos i can take with it
i couldn not be happier and i take it everywhere
the only disadvantage i can find is that the battery that this camera needs to work is very hard to find , and maybe the seller should have specified it with the information regarding the camera
it works with <NUM> cr2 <NUM> v batteries .
had i waited , this would have been the one
i have the rebel g , and it has been a great camera
having worked in larger , formats , i really felt kind of like a &quot ; cheater&quot ; when i got my new rebel
one roll of film was all it took to make a convert of me
i have rarely been disappointed with my photos
in fact , the only time i have been , i was really stretching my photographic wings , and had i read the manual more carefully , would not have been disappointed had i followed the directions
my bought the rebel <NUM> this spring , and i didn not think they could improve much on the one i have , but they did
trying to focus on confusing images , such as framing wildlife with nearby foliage , can be challenging
the <NUM> point automatic focusing is a real plus in this respect
i have learned to work without it , but the advantage of the system allows for quicker capture of images without the need to compose and then to the frame you want
because the camera is so , i will probably not need to replace it for another <NUM> years
but---if it should somehow meet with an early demise , the improvements in the new rebel <NUM> would be very welcome !
the canon rebel eos <NUM> is really one of the best buys in 35mm film cameras
the autofocus lens works for all but the longest shots , and telephoto lenses are readily available
it is user friendly and takes fantastic photos for the price
it would take a much more expensive camera to make a notable difference in picture quality
i have owned nikon cameras all of my life ( and still do ) and love them , but nikon doesn not really have a comparable camera to the eos in this price range
this camera is comparable to the old ae1 program ( a great camera also ) , but with more features and even easier to use
a lot of &quot ; bang for the buck&quot ; !
this camera is a quality product and takes excellent pictures , especially in outdoor lighting
however , at the cost , i can not give it an exceptional rating
i use this camera to take action sports photos
if you are close to the action , the camera does a good job
but , $400 seems so expensive to me , even if that is what the market will bear .
this camera is very similar in features to the minolta stsi , in about the same price range , but i was still impressed enough with it to make a few comments
one thing the stsi offers that the canon doesn not is predictive autofocus
this can be quite useful when doing action shots
it also offers a panorama mode , which the canon doesn not offer
i have enjoyed using this mode quite a bit on my little fuji tiara aps camera
both cameras have similar f ratios for the lens and both have 1/2000th of a sec top shutter speeds
two things the canon offers that are nice are the <NUM> selectable autofocus points , which some advanced users might find useful , and preview
even the elan ii doesn not offer the latter capability
one last thing to be aware of is that the minolta camera will usually be offered with a 3rd party lens
if you want a minolta lens you will need to pay quite a bit more for it
however , the canon comes with a canon lens but doesn not cost any more
all in all , this is a pretty camera at an attractive price , which should serve the needs of the vast majority of photo buffs .
so much better than the rebel x ! it it lightweight , takes fabulous pictures , and looks good to boot ! having used my mom is rebel x for years , i finally bought the <NUM> in september of 2002
i love the fact of having it ! in the bag , it doesn not break my shoulders like the x did , and takes beautiful photos
i am into slr , however , my first digital will be a minolta dimage 7i ( )
i *will* be keeping this one , though , for the long distance shots with the other lense i have for it and teleconverter
worth having for anybody !
i bought my wife one of these to replace her aging pentax k1000
she is very happy with the features and the light weight , as well as its ease of operation
you can run it as a camera , fully manual , or any of a number of modes in between
the only negative to this camera is the standard lens , but if you are a casual photographer you won not mind its mediocure optical performance
remember , this is a relatively inexpensive camera and it has a lot of features for the money
if you want to spend more on the lens , get the excellent canon lens , or for more flexability get one of the third party lenses ( which aren not great optically but again are a great value )
i own a canon elan iie , which is a better camera in some ways but i would certainly recommend the rebel <NUM> to anyone wanting a superior point and shoot , a photography student , or a traveller needing light weight and all capability , or even as a second body for someone with another canon camera ( i am thinking about this myself ) .
my child is a black and white photographer , this unit was a great gift to produce black and white pictures .
but the fact is , i use the automatic setting <PERCENT> of the time
it is a nearly a camera that takes perfect pictures almost every time
( i own the canon rebel g - very similar to the canon 2000 , but purchased in 1998 ) and i hate to confess this too , but
i take photos professionally
( people pay me for my photos and they are published in the print media and on the internet ) shameful , i know , but it is true
with my little canon rebel , i put the little thingie on the automatic setting , point , pause ( let the camera make its best decisions ) and then shoot
i then drop the film off at the local camera shop
( first few times , i had to take the whole camera in because i wasn not sure how to unload and reload the film , although that is pretty easy too ) when i pick up the photos , they are just beautiful
now , i have had to learn some hard lessons about camera flash and shadows , but that is hardly the camera is fault
experience has taught me a lot , there
in summary , i am not a camera person
i don not *want* to be a camera person
but my canon rebel has paid for itself many times over from the photos i have sold
it combines the best of modern electronics with photographic excellence
and it has a dazzling display of options for those who want to play with all the fancy features
but for me - i am sticking with the automatic thingie
i would highly recommend this camera to others
three different people ( that i know of ) have bought this camera , after watching me use it and then seeing the end results
( under the &quot ; good grief , if she can take good pictures , anybody can&quot ; philosophy
) they were all astonished that someone who knows so little could take such incredible photos
only downside - it is a delicate camera
no forgiveness factor on dropping it
i use the strap faithfully .
just started exploring the camera
i love the light weight and the auto focus/flash that pops up when required
my only disappointment was that when i got the unit i didn not realize there was a slightly different model available that lets you time/date stamp your photos
if i had known about that other model i would have ordered it
bought this camera after having used my sisters
can be as simple or complex to use as needed .
i have had this camera for about <NUM> yrs now - i take it on all my business travels
whenever i get a chance to go out on on the weekends , i take this camera and my sony camcorder in my backpack , roam the streets of the new city and shoot pictures
the pictures that i shoot from this camera are just awesome - no matter whatever experiment i do with it
most useful features : 1
aperture control with depth of field preview- lets to focus the foreground and blur the background2
shutter speed control upto infinity- lets you control the amount of time for which the shutter can be kept open3
it is pretty rugged , dont try dropping it : ) i have used it to shoot pics from 'maid of the mist' in niagara falls and i almost thought that i was going to lose it
but it worked liked a charmnegatives- bulky , but you will get used to it , it always gets attention- cost of developing film - what i do these days is to just get the photos on a cd , then develop only those photographs that are good
why is this camera better than a digital camera ? - if you are spending $200 on a digital camera , i feel that the slr is way far too ahead of any digital camera in that price range- if you are spending $1000 on a digital camera , a digital slrs are very mature today - worth buying
ideally , i would buy this slr , take this whenever i really want to take good photographs , then i would also want to have a $100 kodak digital camera for casual shots
this would mean an ideal combination
if you are buying this slr , you can also consider buying a film/photo scanners ( available for less than $150 now ) - which lets you scan the negatives/positives without even going for a cheap cd print
from the reviews what i read on amazon , these scanners must be amazing .
both camera body and lens appear to have been made in japan
but in using the equipment , will entail a lot of guess work , though
the exposure meter is quite difficult to figure as there is no indicator ( light or arrow ) to set proper exposure
as of now , i am still deciding if i will keep or return the whole package
so , please provide instructions on how to return everything
the merchant , globooks does not even have a a mailing address
but nonetheless , i would like to know how i can return everything

i have been using nikons for over <NUM> years , starting with my first used and battered ftn
over that time i have a accumulated a dozen nikkor lenses and numerous accessories , as well as an assortment of bodies
one thing that is been missing in recent years from the nikon line is a reasonably priced manual camera
the cheaper nikons have tended to be fully automated cameras , and the cheapest manual nikon still being made was , until recently , the fm2 at well over $500
if you work the way i do , you need a manual camera and don not have a lot of use for automation and autofocusing
if you own an old nikon and some old nikkor lenses , you may want a simple manual camera body that can accomodate them
if you are a student starting out , or an artist on a budget , you need a manual camera
if you fit into any of these categories , the fm10 is a great choice
it may not be as rugged as a $1200 f3 or a $2500 f5 , but it is well made and should last many years
i am not a fan of zoom lenses for my own work , but the included is a good quality lens with a useful range , and you can add more lenses if you need them
all in all , a good value and a inexpensive entry into the nikon system .
this 35mm is pretty much the perfect college kid film camera
it wont spoon feed you when it comes to learning , which will really help you in the long run
in the age of "press this button and you are focused" , this camera is one of the few 35mm is left that doesn not have af
also wont change exposure levels to what the camera suggests ( such as av or tv mode some cameras have ) , this gives you the freedom to be creative as some shots have a whole different mood if underexposed a stop or overexposed a bit
as for manual focus , it is something you need to be able to do as a photographer
sometimes the computer in your camera just doesn not focus perfectly on that eye you want in focus , or for something as precise as macro photography which has very shallow depth you are going to need pinpoint accuracy that a computer can not do for you
this lens is great because it is like the vintage 35mm except you don not have to worry about the light meter or any other small part inside of it being broken
nor do you have to worry about the image quality
the kit lens in this camera is very sharp
it is a bit limiting considering it is f/3
5 so that rules out really low light ( but grain can be good , unlike noise in digital ; grain has an artistic quality ) , but considering the price and the quality of the whole kit it is great
sure you can get a used one from the 70 is or 80 is for way cheaper , but chances are something is broken in that thing and you may not know until you have invested <NUM> hours developing the first roll in your class
so shell out a little bit extra and get this , it is worth it
edit : i still like this , shot some street photography with it since it is really compact compared to a big dslr , but one big con i have found is build quality
it is got a lot of plastic , and i did drop it once which resulted in a huge dent
the silver parts look metal but they aren not , they are some sort of chrome paint covering more plastic
i don not baby my gear so this thing is starting to look kinda ugly
it hasn not completely broken yet though
i said the kit lens was sharp in my review , but really i now know it is not as good as i made it out to be , i recommend a used nikon e series 50mm 1
8 ais which can be had for cheap on the used market .
like many online reviews and even wikipedia describe this camera , the is a entry level film camera
still , even though it lacks any kind of automation and ( more important imho ) a pentaprism viewfinder ( extremely important for preview with lenses faster than f/2
8 ) , i believe that this camera is as good as any other slr film camera
furthermore , i doubt that any beginner or even more serious amateur photographer who would choose film over digital , has a desire for high automation features in such a camera
the ( manufactured by cosina in japan and sold under the nikon brand ) has a built in that requires two small batteries ( provided with the camera ) and is operated by a separate button on the slightly upper left side of the lens
operating the meter button does require a shift in what would be the most natural and safest left hand grip of the camera , so that holding the camera in a steady position while using the light meter button becomes a bit uncomfortable , but that probably only goes for people with smaller hands like myself
since most modern light meters suffer from a biased factory calibration ( meaning they would fail the grey card test ) , i am yet to run some appropriate tests as to check the accuracy of this light meter is calibration
on the positive side ( and the right side of the camera ) , the preview button/lever , although not useful through the entire aperture range as mentioned above , is in a comfortable position and does fulfill its purpose at apertures starting from f/4 up
although built on a metallic frame , the camera is body is mostly plastic
personally , i don not think it feels cheap ( no squeaky noises during handling ) but i do feel like exercising caution at all times when handling it or placing it on hard surfaces , and i will think twice before taking the camera out in the rain , mist or extreme cold weather ( i wouldn not care with a <NUM> yrs
old nikon f1 ) , rolling in the dirt or sand for nature close ups , etc
the camera case , although not made of quality leather as you might expect from a nikon camera ( but again , this is not a nikon built camera ) , does provide a reasonable level of protection , except maybe for the top edges of the camera , where the attempt to leave the strap hooks come thru , has left those areas exposed to dust and other possible external damaging factors
it is also a bit awkward to remove and put back on because its edges always rub harshly agains the focus ring of the lens , which in time might create marks or even damage , especially on a plastic built lens like the one that comes with the camera
i would suggest looking for an older ( much tougher and better built ) leather case
the lens that comes with the camera is rated one of nikon is worst lenses ( check out ken rockwell is reviews for more info ) , but that doesn not mean you cannot take any pictures at all with it
a lens choice is always a matter of personal taste , as well as an educated choice for some users
the day i ordered my , i have also ordered a nikkor 50mm f/1
2 manual focus lens , a mechanical and optical masterpiece suitable only for fully manual film nikon slrs at an unbeatable price compared to similar lenses built for digital or automated cameras
i have removed the bundled lens without even removing the lens cap and replaced it with the 50mm ( much heavier as it is all metal built )
for those who are not willing to &<HASHTAG> ; waste&<HASHTAG> ; $ on a new fixed lens , i would suggest the older nikkor ais lens
you probably won not be able to find a new one because they don not make them anymore ( as opposed to the 50mm above that you can get brand new ) , but you should be able to find one online in very good condition , anywhere between $100 and $400 depending on the seller
i got one for $220 in mint condition on ebay
remember , the lens is the most important part of your camera and the decisive factor in the overall quality of your pictures ( apart of course from your aesthetic and artistic feel )
it remains to be seen how the of this camera will hold over time , but unless you want to go for one of the much older , bulkier ( but better built ) genuine nikon slrs , then the is a good choice for the money , even if i consider the lens completely useless ( that is just me )
the reason why i didn not go for an old nikon is because i couldn not find one from a reliable source
all sellers claim their old nikons to be in perfect or good condition , most of them actually being completely unaware of any possible problems
unfortunately , the slightest mechanical issue in an old nikon slr is very hard to detect , even harder to fix or , and ultimately renders the camera unusable ( i
a slight shift in exposure time )
with the money i'd pay for a defective nikon f1 ( rated in good condition ) and having it fixed , i'd get a new , a leather case and some lens filters
overall , even if i don not feel the same confidence ( yet ) as i used to with my old zenit 11 , i am happy with my new purchase and will try to get the best of it for as long as i can
i hope this helps you make the right choice for you .
i ordered this camera for the sole purpose of using it in my black/white photo class
and so far i have been able to do everything required with this camera
the lens that comes with the camera is a great starter lens
you have the 35mm setting for to take some pretty good wide angle shots , and u can zoom in any where all the way up to 70mm
its a very versatile lens ! some people think this is a "beginners" camera and while it is a great camera to learn on , even my photography teacher who has been shooting for over <NUM> years still owns one of these cameras and loves it
the body is not made out of metal like a lot of earlier nikons , but that doesnt mean this camera wont last you a good 40+ years if treated correctly
but i do however have some concerns
my first issue was that the lens has a little bit of movement up by the focusing barrel
as in its not <PERCENT> tight
im not sure if all lens are like this or if its because this nikkor lens is maybe cheaper quality than other nikon/nikkor lenses
its not really anything big but i decided to exchange it and the next one i got was the same
also for a night photography assignment i had to do , i decided to shoot without a tripod but instead use some 3200iso film
my instructor said that i should be fine with <NUM> because its very sensitive to light , hover i found my self only being able to shoot at f3
5 and with a 30/100 shutter speed ! and i did set the cameras iso to 3200
dont know if thats normal or not
and finally one thing that was confusing about purchasing this camera on amazon was their very confusing product description that says these camera are "refurbished" yet when you look at the sellers and their listings , all of them are listed as new
my camera appeared to be new but i dont think there is a way to tell for sure .
i have an embroidery machine that i purchased at the end of 2004
i did a lot of reading before using it and found out that sandisk brand flash cards were highly recommended to use when storing purchased designs
they are the only brand of compact flash that does not lose any of my designs ( i had this happen years ago on a different brand of compact flash )
i have bought almost 3 , 000 designs over the years and i always trust using a sandisk compact flash card over anything else on the market !
i needed this to be able to power up and use an older version digital camera for one of my children
this came to me as a new unit and when i plugged it in , it worked as expected
thanks .
the most common application for this type of memory card is a digital camera , but these can also be used with a number of electronic devices , including the hp jordana , and even your laptop computer with a pc card adapter
you can store any type of data on the cartridge , and they can be quickly changed between devices
i have never had a problem with any of my sandisk compact flash cards .
though this card , <NUM> megs is minute , you still may only need that
i picked this up ( about <NUM> 1/2 years ago ) , when it was state of the art & about sixty bucks or so
i still have both cards ! well over 4 , 000 photos & bazillions of files ! never a read or write error ! i have never lost anything with it
unlike the lexar ! if you are looking into compact flash cards , go with who started it
i have a 128mb sandisk , & am now looking into their <NUM> gig ultra card , for my new camera
because i want speed , & need the space for 8mp photos
the write/capture function is slow , it is not meant for speed
but for swapping & transferring it is faster than from cd ( with the right reader/writer ) ! sd cards & micro drive are inching in , but sandisk keeps imporoving the cf ( they also make sd cards )
there are cheaper & less expensive cards out there , but how important is your data/photo ? you can not always retrieve your files , with the flash memory programs
i know
i used three of them on my lexar , & never got all of the images
but that just may be the cards i have , who knows ? there isn not any quality control any longer , who cares ? sandisk is the most accurate .
commend added in december 2002 : this review was written when <NUM> megapixel cameras were top of the line , and a <NUM> mb card costed over a hundred dollars
now , the prices have dropped so much that the same review would be more applicable to a <NUM> or <NUM> mb card
- a
nobody would argue that the more memory you have in your digital camera , the better
the question is what the reasonable compromise between the price of a memory card and its size is , and how to predict how much memory you actually need before you paid for it
i looked up some literature on the image compression techniques , and made some experiments with printing out pictures with different resolution and different compression ratios , and came to the following conclusions
most cameras offer a choice between several picture resolutions and several image compression modes
low resolution is good for viewing , while high resolution is better suited for printouts
it is not uncommon for digital photographers to take pictures at a resolution lower than the maximum allowed by their camera , although there seems to be no point of buying an expensive camera to take pictures
a probable reason for that is that their camera was shipped with a very small memory card and did not upgrade it yet
unfortunately , high resolution images require lots of storage space : an uncompressed image taken by a <NUM> megapixel camera can be as large as <NUM> mb
jpeg compression , which is based on an algorithm specifically developed for image compressing helps to store large pictures in relatively small files
specifically , jpeg compression algorithm divides an image into squares 8*8 pixels each , performes discrete cosine trasform of each of these squares , and compresses their frequency spectra by removing the components or by decreasing their accuracy through a "quantization" procedure
while this review is not appropriate for a discussion of technical details of the jpeg algorithm , it is worth saying that jpeg analyzes each small "brick" of the image individually and adapts the level of smoothing/compressing to the image to be compressed
in fact , you determine not the size of the compressed image , but the level of its quality : the final size of the compressed file varies depending on each particular image
this "adaptive" nature of jpeg makes it very efficient : it takes advantage of the smoothness of monotonically colored parts of the image by achieving great compression ratios in those areas without significant losses in quality , and it is also good at rendering sharp contrasts in the image
since jpeg standard was optimized to take into account the specifics of our perception of visual information ( like mp3 compression of music files takes advantage of the way how we hear music ) , jpeg compressed pictures are almost undistinguishable from the originals up to the compression ratios of 1 : 8 to 1 : 12
therefore , a combination of highest possible resolution of your camera with the "fine" ( or "best" ) compression mode is a good choice for a digital photographer
if this combination of resolution and compression is used , a <NUM> mb memory card would be sufficient for about <NUM> pictures taken by a <NUM> megapixel camera , or for about <NUM> pictures taken by a <NUM> megapixel camera
this is equivalent to one or two rolls of film , which is not a lot , but usually suffices for a day of occasional shooting
hence , it seems to me that a <NUM> mb memory card is a good buy for the most of us
just the last comment : note that there are two types of memory , flash and smartmedia
check you camera manual which one you need
smartmedia memory cards are slimmer , if i am not mistaken .
needed this for older raymarine electronics in order to perform software upgrade
worked like a charm , typical excellent quality from sandisk
make sure this is what you need before ordering .
when i purchased my digital camera ( kodak dc280 ) i included one of these for extra space
the card works properly and was at a good price
what else can you ask for ? not much , unless you find that you sometimes take lots of photos
i guess that includes me
in which case you will wish that you purchased a larger card
i bought the viking 128mb card , and now feel completely prepared with the combined cards providing enourmous storage
unless you are going to be away for an extended period , i can not imagine needing more space
the bottom line is that this card works , but you need to really consider what your storage requirements will be so you can select the right size .
i have a <NUM> mb sandisk compact flash card for my nikon coolpix 950 , a digital cam
this card will allow you to record about <NUM> pictures at the standard ( 640x480 ) resolution , so if you find you are not a 'power user' of your camera , it should be plenty - and the ratio is right ! however , if you regularly shoot at higher resolutions such as 1600x1200 ( i
8&quot ; x 10&quot ; photo quality ) , you won not be able to fit <NUM> photos on this card
in that event , you might want to think about going for their 96mb card ( also available from amazon ! ) with this size card you might also want to think about going for sandisk is inexpensive usb card reader - it is up to 50x as fast and a lot less hassle than hooking the camera up to the computer !
the sandisk card works perfectly with both my digital camera and visor prism is memplug card
the memplug module , by pitech , allows a handspring visor to use a compactflash ( or smartmedia ) card as if it were an extension of the hand held is own ram
i made the mistake of initially purchasing a compusa compactflash card but had to return it when it proved to be incompatible
the sandisk is a winner .
at <NUM> x <NUM> resolution , this memory card holds images on my polaroid camera ( that is like rolls of film )
the price and capacity are just right for weekend trips or special events
*go crazy* and take pictures of anything and everything that catches your eye ! i took <NUM> pictures in <NUM> hours at my company is &quot ; relay for life&quot ; event on friday , and really enjoyed not having to &quot ; budget&quot ; my photos or worry about running out of film
the image quality was excellent , and downloading was quick &amp ; easy with a digital film reader
i am planning a trip to spain this fall , and am considering an additional 32mb sandisk memory card just in case i get *too crazy*
does anyone know if they make a storage case for spare memory cards ?
makes my camera not obsolete
i had a hard time locating this memory cardfor my old , old , old camera .
initially , when i bought my creative labs webcam 3 , the button was stuck
but after replacing it , i have had no physical problems since
this package includes a manual , the webcam , webcam software and some image editing software
i never used the image software so cannot say much about it
the webcam software is excellent , it includes the regular video and image capture software but also has a motion detector program
this allows you to capture images any time someone or anything passes the camera , great for detecting if people are using the computer when your out
the quality of the camera is great
<NUM> x <NUM> video capture is quite jerky , at about <NUM> fps average but at <NUM> x 480 , the image is quite smooth sometimes exceeding <NUM> fps
the focus is a little dial on the lens , easy to adjust ( autofocus would be nice though ) this camera works well on netmeetings and cuseeme , i have had no problems since
by the way , installing was quite easy , all the programs installed from the installer , i had absolutely no problems
all in all , this is a very decent package
i only once had to talk to tech support and their service was prompt and helpful .
i must say that this was a breeze ( under <NUM> min ) to set up
i do not know why the others had problems
pluged it in , win98 picked up the new device , pointed it to the drivers on the cd , cranked up net meeting , and i was off ! if you want fast top notch quality video , then spend more on a better web cam , but if you just want a basic ( with some cool features like zoom ) camera for a very low price , then this is the camera for you
i do not regret buying it , as it was a great , cheap , way for me to get my feet wet with video conferencing , among other things
enjoy .
i bought this camera about <NUM> months ago and was really excited , considering this was my first
it has worked reasonably well throughout this time
the only complaint that i have with this cam is that when i activate the camera software it deactivates my internet connection
other than that it has been a great camera for not only the advanced user but also the novice
the picture quality is not bad and for the price you really can not ask for much more
as for the software it was also easy to install and to use .
setup/installation of the camera wasn not perfectly smooth
the instructions weren not <PERCENT> in line with the choices in windows 98
once installed , camera works easily
picture is not great , but clear
the manual focus is not that meaningful
the web update and &quot ; watch&quot ; functionality work well .
i found this camera to have a very easy setup and great picture quality
i am running it on a windows me machine and it works wonderfully .
i bought this because it was in my price range
the quality isn not great , but it does what i need it to do
if you need a still or video pc camera for school , don not get this one
spend the extra money and get a really nice one
if you just need a pc camera for instant messageing and sharing photos , this is a good camera .
this is easy to install , easy to update ( online ) , and very very easy to use
don not expect super high resolution photographic excellence , but if you want to talk via video chat online , take snap shots , or send recorded messages this is the business
more than enough for the avergae computer user , highly recommended .
this camera performs excellent under bright daylight
the picture is clear and if you set the contrast right , images look great
the only thing i dislike about the quickcam is that it is very difficult to set it on a table , on top of the monitor , anywhere without it toppling back or falling sideways
the round camera comes with a rubber base to put it on
the round camera has something like a metal hook or screw on the bottom , and the base has a slit on top
you are supposed to slide the screw back and forth on the slit in order to point it where you want to record , but once you get the angle , the heavy cable pulls the camera back and it goes toppling to the floor
very frustrating at the least
i found myself moving towards where tha camera was finally pointing
otherwise , the software is pretty easy to use , even though it takes very long to load
i have windows me
you can record videos of unlimited length
i have had so much fun with this thing !
even if you just want this camera for casual use with your computer and are flexible about picture quality , you will probably have headaches installing the drivers
i gave up on their mouse years ago , and i suggest avoiding this product as well
i got it as a gift , and i found that with respect to camera , software , and overall quality this product is a loser .
this camera is incredibly easy to install , it really is just plug and play
you will need to have video conf software like netmeeting or cuseeme - the included software isn not worth installing , and the drivers on win98 cd are fine
won not work with windows nt unless you have installed a usb hub and drivers especially for nt4
win2000 seems to function ok with it
rotating focus wheel is cumbersome if you are trying to focus the camera and aren not standing right next to it
get the latest drivers from logitech ( 3com ) online
the image is not crystal clear , so don not expect the same quality as you get from a digital camera , but if you are looking for cost , your friends will be able to see you just fine with this one
the mounting stand is a little wierd , and the camera cable makes it shift back and forth
i had to tie down the cable so i could position the camera and it wouldn not move
it is not worth investing in a stand for this one because of the picture quality .
i bought this camera to replace an older model of quickcam which looks the same and is also usb
i replaced it because for some reason windows xp doesn not like it and it can not be used with xp since the os upgrade
this camera installed easy but i had to d/l the xp software off the web as the software it came with is old
i expected at least the same quality as the other since it is been years and i now have the best os available
no ! the picture quality is crap and can not be tweaked
there is this total grainy appearance to the images and the dpi seems much less even though its still 150dpi
don not waste your money
i don not see any resolution/quality differences with the more expensive models either
good luck , mike
hey it is <NUM> bucks ( roundabout )
for that , the setup was , and using it was a cinch
but personally , i wish for two things : that it wasn not colored white , cuz it get is dirty real easy
u leave it on top of your monitor , the dust collects and
also , when i used netmeeting , no matter how much i tried to focus , the pciture wasn not entirely clear
but again , for it is price , this camera is a sweet deal , and pretty cool looking too !
total junk
installer shut down , forcing a manual installation
image is grainy , regardless of settings , colors aren not right
horrible , avoid .
these don not stop working when i sweat , which all of my other ones would do
love the handy case and the sound is good
i bought another pair i liked them so much
edited on
left earbud stopped working .
i have had three pair of these now , going on nearly <NUM> years
the only reason i have replaced my previous two pair was because i lost them ! one in a seatback on a plane
they are quite durable
the winding case helps avoid the usual wire failures
the sound is good , not great , but i am fine with making the trade for durability and convenience
i laid in a second set as a spare for when i eventually lose them again !
i have run through a lot of earphone this past year so i am getting to be rather an expert on the problems
this is one of the best
the sound is the best i have found no matter the price range
i especially like the smaller ear buds
some of others were an "areaness factor"
they were so big i was constantly aware of their pressure
i don not feel these
they are so comfortable , i don not notice anything but beautiful sound
full range from highs to low with no fuzziness or distortion
just pure rich clean sound
the cord is coated and reinforced , so will take wear
great item , great price
so put on clannad or silly tinkers and have at it !
i have had these headphones for over a year and am <PERCENT> satisfied
i use them exclusively for working out and running
they have pretty good sound , a nice carrying case , and have survived over a year is worth of running
i have not had any problems with them falling out of my ears or the wire shorting out
in fact , i use a tie on the wire so that the cord is not so long when i run
despite this , no problems
this is probably the best pair of headphones i have ever purchased
i am so happy that i am ordering another pair .
update : durability is not as expected
after a few months of moderate daily use ( mp3 player in my shirt pocket ) during my commute to and from work the connection between the wires and the stereo plug is beginning to fail
regular body movements will cause a break in the connection and i don not expect these to last to the end of the year
too bad since they produce nice sound
----------------------------------------------------had these for a few months before opening the package and trying them on
first tried to use the buds as they were packed - without the little spongy covers over the buds - and was totally disappointed with a loose fit , weak midrange , scratchy treble , and almost no bass whatsoever
finally got the brilliant idea of putting the covers on and giving them one last try
wha ? ! ? ! were these the same phones ? the buds fit much better in my ears and i had a totally different experience with great mids , good treble , and very decent bass
these earbuds won not change your life but they will make your muni commute more pleasant by allowing you to block out the miscellaneous grunts and chirps made by your fellow transit commuters
just remember to use the sponge thingys .
i always use headphones when walking , for some reason the headphones give me headaches
so i have always also just assumed that i'd never have clear sound
no more ! these headphones are wonderful
the range of music i like is very much varied
these sound great for all types , and most surprisingly is their ability to handle resonant bass in some newer songs
i am really amazed , actually
it is weird having sound that is as good as a nice stereo when you are walking the dog
one setback is that i need to use the foam covers because the plastic buds along fall out of my ears at the slightest tug of the cable
it is a setback for me
maybe my ears are getting bigger as i get older ? this has never been an issue
regardless , it is a tiny fault for the best , cheapest headphones i have ever bought .
i purchased these for sport use , and compared them with a set of sennheiser earbuds i use at the office
the sonys are a little more expensive , but they have better sound , more bass response , and fit my ears better
although i am a fan of sennheiser products , in this case the sony product is superior .
i bought these earbuds for my cd player ( at the time ) because the ones i had before died on the right side
they were a pair of rca behind the neck headphones i bought at family dollar for very cheap
i would buy another pair but now i have an ipod and want to buy mostly earbuds and clip headphones that are more portable
i was planning on buying a pair of philips earbuds at target because ( i thought ) these were dead on the right side and i dislike the ipod earbuds , but when i plugged these into my ipod they worked fine
after a session they sound even better
well , they are only ten bucks , so what can you expect ? not a ton , not a surround soundstage and great , powerful sound , but maybe something that has at least average sound , are comfortable , and will last a decent amount of time
and thatt is mostly what i got with these earbuds
they don not have stellar sound ( that for some reason a ton of reviews rave about ) , but they have decent sound that is good enough for the money
not a lot of bass , but some pairs at this price have barely any bass
the mids on this pair are emphazised ( but not by a lot , props to sony )
and they do have a good , clean sound to them , so even if you are unhappy with the low end of these earbuds you at least have a good upper end
for other aspects of the earbuds , they are very comfortable and fit much better than the apple earbuds , but feel better with the pads
i have already lost the pads but still fit fine and are still comfortable for long periods of time
also , these are some durable headphones so far , and after a of use they still put up nicely
overall , not a bad pair of esrbuds for portables
already got a better pair ? keep these for some useful
they don not have amazing sound , but are comfortable and last long enough to make them worth the price
<NUM> stars
note : this is a waterproof version of the mdre828lp earbuds
these would be a better deal if you are using them mostly outdoors .
like most websites i have looked for these headphones on , they are showing you the picture of the ( now discontinued ) , but if you look closely at the model number below , it is the cheaper
don not be fooled .
about a month ago , i decided to get some better sounding phones to use in my studio
i bought a pair of sony , and a pair of sony from their
the v900 sounds fine for listening , but the <NUM> shows much more detail
if you really wanna hear what is in the mix , the <NUM> is the ticket
the v900 does favors for low mp3 encoded stuff , and it is pleasant to listen to
with a bit of a bump in the region , but there is just not enough detail to be able to use for critical projects
i bought more pairs of
that should tell you something
there has been some talk that sony may discontinue the 7506
sure hope that doesn not happen
btw , the consumer is not the same thing as the
the v600 sounds much more like the .
the sony v900 headphones have a printed frequency response of , 000hz and i believe it
they are very sensitive and require a small amount of power to drive and can be driven to deafening levels
they have great imaging
the only thing that is wrong with them is that don not fit my head the way that they were designed and i have to wear them backwards with the right channel in the left ear and the left channel in the right ear
i can wear them hours on end
i listen to mostly classical music , but right now i have some lords of acid on which is dance/electronic
the response is fairly flat , but because the headphones couple with the ear so well the bass response is almost felt ! my opinion is that the sound of these headphones is fairly neutral
someone mentioned the sony model <NUM> which to me has a more forward
if you can not afford these headphones the sony dj seems to be just about the same , but a tad less comfortable
it has about the same response and sensitivity
but i would recommend this model for long term use and happiness
the only problem i have had is the have worn out and that is because i am in florida and sometime when coming in from the outside i have gotten the earcups wet and obviously they could only stand up to so much of that .
these headphones have lasted <NUM> years and now the cord shield is deteriorating
these sony headphones do sound really good , but would have to make some adjustments with placing them over my ears to get the great sound
these sony monitor headphones are very good for home use which is what i purchased them for
the music i listen to works well with these nicely ; meditation and environmental music files , also drum music
sony has a great line of products , but the construction of the cords are very poor
if the cord had greater quality , then these headphones would have another star in my rating
as far as my recomendation is for these , well , i can not make one since they only would last for five yrs
i have used them a lot , but have starting using my sony earbuds more , and even those seem to have poor cord construction
so because of the very poor cord construction , i would now suggest another brand for headphones , or earbuds .
i have had a variety of sony headphones ( and others over the years - sennheiser , nady , panasonic , pioneer , etc
) including the mdr , , and others
these monitors though are the best ! i use them for monitoring music , movies , and most importantly , i use them when playing my bass guitar at church
they have a great "boot'en" as well as a excellent very high upper ambience reproduction
they simply kick ! i paid much more for them than that advertized on amazon right now and i am considering buying other pairs for my drummer , sound technician , and guitarist for our church group
my opinion is you can not go wrong with these babies !
initially bought these phones for home recording
at first they were a little tight on my wide head , but after a while they broke in and were very comfortable
for recording , i found these phones to accentuate the bass a little too much
however , for ham ( amateur ) radio , they are excellent for discerning weak signals
a short wave enthusiast would probably also like these phones .
this is my second pair and i have nothing but good things to say ! comfortable , good bass depth and very durable
volume control is a huge plus , especially in the workshop which is where i am most of the time .
listening to music through these headphones is like listening to music through a blanket
everything sounds muted , the highs don not extend very far , the lows are almost non existent
their sound is anything but clear
dynamics ? forget about iti am looking for a $20ish pair of headphones to keep in my backpack at all times
i figured these might do the job
but wow was i wrong
i found the sony , which is actually cheaper , sound much better
did i mention the build quality sucks ? the xd100s are a little more durable but still leave much to be desired
perhaps that is just low end sonys in general ? i am thinking about just dropping the extra few bucks for a pair of sennheiser px100s or akg k81djs
my main headphones are the grado and beyerdynamic dt990s
i know what good sounds like
all my music is either flac or <NUM> kbps vbr mp3s
i am giving these headphones a two star because i have heard worse
and much better for cheaper .
item arrived quickly and in great condition
i am very satisfied with the headphones and will probably purchase another set in the near future .
i have the is and these have the exact same sound quality
i have bought several different brands in various price ranges ( all the way up to $100 ) , and these are the best bang for the buck
i don not intend to use the built in volume control so hopefully the sound doesn not go out like some of the other reviewers have experienced
the only problem with these sony is is that fake leather they put on the ear muffs
it rubs off eventually and it will stick to your ears
would buy these again if they last a few years .
for the price the best
i have <NUM> pair of these headphones for all my various listening locations ? the volume control works great and very convenient .
these are the only headphones i use now
i have been so pleased with them that whenever i want a pair i simply go to my previous purchase , click on the link , add them to the cart , and as if by magic , they appear at my doorstep in two days
i use a set at work , a set on the boat , a set for the stereo , a set for the music gear , etc , etc
love these headphones .
was just listening to bach is toccata and fugue in d minor with these phones
i'd say they reproduced the recording pretty damn well ! not excessively bright and just right in the minor classical music phrases
the phones are plugged into an onkyo tx8211 ( one of onkyo is rock bottom receiversas i type this ) at 3\5th is volume
also been using these with a notebook and a couple of portable players
they aren not difficult for the lower audio output ( battery powered ) devices to drive
happy to know these work very well with a mobile phone for listening to music
i have a hard time with the for extended periods , they driveme nuts
i try to rate audio stuff based on what is being reproduced
a preference for listening has always been the best recordings i can afford
at times streaming music and other processed audio will be such a disappointmenteven from the best audio gear
spent more than a few bucks on beyers , akg is and sennheisers over the yearsall of which we could pay homage to , yet those don not matter here in this review
i think sony does a good job of designing and making audio things in general
no complaining here
rating the headphones a great buy in the $20-$30 range
if you own these i am hoping you enjoy them as i have been doing .
i use these headphones with my avid mbox mini and since i have set everything up i have stopped using the speakers with my computer as these sound better
they are comfortable for wearing long periods of time without any complaint
my wife will steal them to use on her laptop when doing school work for the same quality and comfort reasons .
these headphones are great at this price ! i already have the previous model which are without the volume control and i wanted one more pair for recording vocals so that the performers can individually set the volume
my only complaint is that there is a certain fatigue after wearing them for more than <NUM> hours ! overall , the sound is great and very well balanced !
excellent price and service
i like the volume control onin the cabel , comeswith two size input jacks
<NUM> meter cabel is just fine for pc use which i purchased it for
excllent product would recommend and will shop vendor again .
i got mine in nov <NUM> and i have used them primarily at work , which is sitting in front of a workstation for about hours a day
most reviews have been very accurate
these are a bit tight even if you have an avg sized head
after about an hour of listening your ears do pain
i just got used to them and probly they have slackened up over time
but they are even more painful if you wear spectacles
also the cushion is pretty cheap and really not very helpful
the sound is decent
from my experience avoid any headphones that have a volume controller since this is the weakest link in the chain
my headphones having finally given up at exactly this point
all in all they served me pretty well for 2
5 yrshope they made some changes to the model .
these sony headphones are a great option for the price range
the ear cups are very comfortable , even when wearing for long time periods , and they provide a decent sound in a variety of uses
these were bought for my boyfriend to practice on his electric drum kit , and he says it works well for that
i have used them to watch movies on my laptop and enjoyed their performance then , as well
other reviewers have noted problems with the inline volume control , but i have yet to have an issue with that and have owned these since 2009 , i believe
i enjoy the extra long length as this makes it easy to stand up and stretch or move around a bit during a movie ( or the boyfriend is practice session ) , and not worry about getting your head jerked from the cord being too short
there is a moderate amount of noise cancelling with these headphones , but don not expect anything excellent in that department
with heavy music going you will know someone is speaking to you , but will not know from which direction or what the person is saying
i do feel that the audio quality is poorer than you'd get with a much higher priced headphone setup , but for this price and intended use , i cannot find any reason to not give these <NUM> stars .
these are great headphones for the money
i have a home recording studio and use these when i play
they are light and comfortable and have plenty of bottom end
this is one step up from the
the only difference being the inline volume control
these also sound great with my phone or mp3 player .
i do not understand the negative reviews
i have had these headphones for years
i wear them at work for hours at a time and can say from experience that they are comfortable
i really appreciate the volume control on the cord
unlike another reviewer , i have had no problems with it
i normally use these with either my computer or my ipod classic , listening to music , podcasts and audio books
they sound pretty good for the money
they have also held up well
of course , they don not sound as good as my more expensive sennheiser phones that i have at home
they are just beginning to wear out , so i may be getting another pair just like them as a replacement
there might possibly be better sounding phones for the same price , but i can say that these are comfortable and have lasted a long time and sound good enough for most purposes
i don not think that you could do much better for the price
update : i have had them for about <NUM> years and they finally broke
i am going to replace them with the same model
i use these at work and the volume control is important to me in my work situation
i can say from <NUM> years of experience that they are durable , comfortable and the volume control held up well for me
the sound quality is adequate
if you don not care about the volume control feature , as most people probably won not , you might want to spend a bit more on better sounding ones
for $20 , i don not think that you could do very much better
if you are after top sound quality , you probably aren not looking at these anyway , but i recommend the sennheiser hd555
that is what i use at home .
perhaps i am just used to real studio headphones , but these don not even sound as good as my in ear monitors
i'd like to give them a break for only being $20 , but considering the fact that these are practically unusable without a high boost and mid cut eq , it is hard to justify the purchase
i just do not know why these lack so much high end and boost the frequencies so much
after cutting these frequencies in itunes , they don not sound bad , but you shouldn not have to run an eq to get a decent sound
only thing i like about these is the inline volume control
do yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks on a higher end model
you will be happy you did .
so crisp comfortable ( i don not find it too hard on my ears even after 5+ hours of wearing them , but i have small ears ) .
these are a great pair of headphones , very sleek and stylish
i haved use these headphones for years and they have worked without any issues
the sound quality is not the best but is better than most headphones in the same price range
the extra long cable makes it perfect if you are connecting this to a tv in a living room .
these are better than $20 headphones , and worse than $80 headphones
pros : - decent sound- long cable , easy to plug into things- great as headphones for the gym , if you are not into earbuds
lightweight , pretty sturdy , and stay on your head well
best of all , they don not get too sweaty
cons : - after a couple years of light use , ear pads will wear out and start shedding little bits of black crud
replacement ear pads cost $6 to $12
- poor at blocking out external sounds , since they don not cover the entire ear
they'd be lousy for office use , since they offer no real isolation .
i have owned this product , bought thru amazon , for about <NUM> months
the sound quality is superb ! my ipod tones are much louder and richer , and i have to decrease the volume on many songs instead of wishing i had more volume with those annoying ipod earbuds
please do not purchase this sony headphone from the apple website , or you will wind up paying about <NUM> dollars more for it after base price , tax and shipping
sony has another winner in these headphones .
the construction is on the frail side but the sound reproduction is superb
it is lightweight and comfortable for long hours .
pros : good sound for the price , and nice long cord , and they look nice
cons : they fit too tight , and i couldn not adjust it .
i have had these headphones for about <NUM> years and are great for the average casual music listener
comfort : i primarily use them at work , and finally found these that are comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time
they are a nice , not too big not too small , ear cup
they are not over ear cups , the padding will rest on your ears
but they are good enough to not be uncomfortable after hours of listening
the band is sturdy and the size does not squeeze on my head
style : nice and not overly bulky like the headphones
the ear cups swing in and up for portability , but they dont fold flat
the cord is very long
i usually keep mine bundled up with a rubber band so it is not all over my workspace
sound : these are no bose , but given that and the low cost
the sound is actually very good
bass is respectable but not
mids and highs are clear and seem to sound pretty good from my novice perspective
i listen to all sorts of music and haven not noticed any distortion at any range and only sometimes wished for a little more bass .
i am wearing my headphones now listening to music on my laptop , which is good
the bad news is that my right earpiece is attached with because it broke and there was not enough surface area to just glue the stem piece
that is to say , the whole earpiece is glued solid to its bracket so it doesn not move
the thing is taped together with packaging tap because it , too , broke when i put the things on my rather large head
they sound fine and all , but i could make a more durable headphone set out of balsa wood
do not consider these things portable unless your bodyguard is willing to carry them in a padded suitcase
maybe i should just glue to the earpieces to my head .
use withipod - mac g4 pb - powermac g5 - creative gigaworks s750 - recording setupit sounds brillant for so a cheap setup
highly recommend it ! the only issue i have it is not compact and sometimes the wire gets in the way
besides that it rules .
as i was finding myself getting ready for a long couple of weeks of temporary duty in guatemala and in need of a good set of headphones for a portable dvd player to watch movies while sitting in a tent , i went to the trusted brand name of sony
the sony traditional collapsible dj style headphones fulfilled this requirement in the usual wonderful manner that sony products so often do
as i lay in the tent watching movies with these outstanding headphones on , the audio tracks on the dvd is were played wonderfully , enhancing the movie watching experience to perfection , giving a theater style performance
while these headphones do not drown out ambient noises completely as they are not advertised to do so , they do keep a majority of the ambient noises to a minimum making the experience that much better
for price and quality , one can hardly do better than to make the decision to purchase these outstanding headphones and i highly recommend them to any and all who find themselves in need of a good pair of headphones
i expect to get several years of good use out of these headphones and have high confidence in the quality and high standard of performance in this , another outstanding sony product ! {ssintrepid}
i purchased these for my father several years ago as a christmas gift for use in his home studio
he plays steel guitar , telecaster and records through professional equipment + pro tools
these deliver an exceptional , above average sound quality that is markedly different than the lower model v150 is ( which we also have several of )
over the years , my dad wore these to bits
the foam on the earpads was coming off completely and it was time for a replacement
unfortunately , the replacement model that is now available in the stores doesn not compare at all to these
thank goodness i was able to get them from amazon marketplace
i will probably buy yet another pair and put them away
a great quality product at a great price !
looking for good headphones for my ipod i came across these
sound quality ( to my ears ) is rather good and clean , with deep bass ( very good for synthesized dance/electronic music or neo soul music which are usually bass heavy , but my jazz and rock sounds great too )
lightweight , it fits snugly over my head and onto my ears and in an office or home environment , blocks out most of the surrounding sound , leaving you to hear just your music
it doesn not block out much subway or airplane noise though
on the downside , the much touted foldability doesn not fold it down to miniscule proportions as i'd hoped , and i find i have to wind up and tie up the 3m long cord
other than these minor gripes , i am a happy camper !
real clean highs , and good clean lows
deep deep bass doesn not penetrate that loudly with these phones , they still are better than everything else in their price and size range
most suited for portable digital music devices
some of the other &quot ; studio&quot ; headphones suck up all your portable player is amperage , this one needs less juice to give you louder sound
i use them with a mp3/fm player , and have found that the mdr is long cord makes for great fm reception , ( even when most of its length is folded up somwehere )
these headphones have a weak spot on the headband where two peices of plastic meet
i broke it on one side , it fixed , and then broke it on the other side as well , ( just for stuffing it in to a jacket pocket )
so don not test the plastic
it can not take pressure
before you get these ones , look at the sony headphones listed in isimilar products'
they look like great sounding headphones .
these provide excellent sound , comfort and they are fairly durable
a very good sound experience for the price .
this is the best headphone i have found for watching tv or listening to voice
however , for music it is sibilant , harsh has too much treble
bass is weak
extremely fatiguing
i own or have owned just about every high end headphone on the market
overall these are better than most $ headphones , but both the koss porta pro and sennheiser px100 in the same price range are vastly more musical , lighter weight and more portable
however , the reason i keep these around is because i have never found a better headphone for tv watching or listening to spoken recordings
i can make out very clearly with little strain , exactly what is being said
they are quite comfortable and the long cord is nice .
i was super happy when i first received these headphones
the quality of the construction is great ! for the price of the headphones , you are getting a steal ! it comes with a 1/8&quot ; to 1/4&quot ; adapter , and all contacts are
the headphones can fold in for easier storage , and the cable is super long , just in case you use it to listen on a sofa ( away from your stereo system )
i am happy on making this purchase for this headphones , and i am very sure it will satisfy just about anyone in terms of sound quality .
i have been using these at work for <NUM> years now
they are sturdy , the sound quality is fine for the price , and they come with a really long cord in case you happen to be running them under a desk into a pc
these are a great value if you are not looking for high quality sound .
these headphones have nothing but boomy bass
highly imbalanced sound
i am sort of an audiophile , but when i bought a $35 headphones , i did not expect the moon and the stars
sad to say i was let down
the basic headphones that came with my discman sound clearer than these
tried them out with my dell laptop , sony discman and harman kardon amp
bad performance in every case
allowed <NUM> hours of break in , still only slight difference
they sound as if the music is lost somewhere within and all you hear are muffled thuds
this is not at all expected from a respected brand like sony
i would give a total thumbs down to this product
if all you want to hear is boom and dont care about clarity or balance in sound then maybe this is for you , else stay away
i am returning mine .
let me begin by saying that these headphones are advertised as &quot ; for djs/for studio use
&quot ; given this , one would expect sony to be targeting their dj audience with these headphones
which they most certainly did not ! while the audio quality of these headphones is quite impressive for the price ( surpassing the similarly priced v600s , if you ask me ) , the fact that these are designed for dj use bothers me because they lack in volume
even with both headphone &amp ; master volume maxed on my mixer ( ) , i find myself struggling to hear what is happening on the channel b while channel a is playing over the speakers
kick in the extra cash and get the v700s , which outperform these in every way possible and are much better suited for live performance use
if , on the other hand , you are looking for a set of headphones for home use , these are a reasonable consideration .
1/2 the price of my neighborhood electronics store bestbuy
that sums it up , it would have been even better with a bag !
i love it ! nice sound and noise reduction capability
and my friend says the girls them love it too
it got caught in a taxi door and it still keeps on kicking too so that is a plus .
i am going to start with the good : the sound is ok
highs and mids are decent while bass lacks a bit
construction is really durable , i like how there is no exposed cable other than where it runs to the player
if you fall asleep with headphones on like the panasonic that have an exposed cable above the earcup you will likely form a break in the cable from sleeping on it
not so with these cans
also the cable is nice , thick , and it is coiled
the bad : it is almost impossible to listen at an enjoyable volume and be polite
even at just <PERCENT> volume on my zune people across the room can hear what i am listening to
this is a big reason i don not like these
if you don not care if you annoy people i guess it is ok
they can get uncomfortable in long listening sessions ( like after <NUM> min or so ) , sometimes near the end of an album i have to take a break
the headband or whatever that holds the cups to your ears is just too strong/tight for an adult head
it is fine for short sessions
i actually had a pair of panasonic before these
i fell asleep in them too often and the problem i described earlier with the cable happened so i got these to replace them
i liked the panasonic better than these even though they have that bit of exposed cable by the earcups making them vulnerable to break if you fall asleep in them
they were about the same price , but they were much more comfortable and sound was better .
after talking to my brother about how much i love my sony mdr 7506s and even letting him try them on he told me he wanted a pair just like them but i didn not have the money to order them for him for christmas my dad went to best buy and bought him these dj v500s
while half the price of the 7506s the v500s are probably the best headphones that you can get for 50$
i won not tell them this but i think that the 7506s , v6s and even the sony v600s sound better than these and are more durable
however since he loves them and they are cheap it seems like a good deal for him but after reading how easily these dj headphones break i really don not think these are worth replacing with the same model once every year especially when the 7506s sound at least twice as good and can last several years longer
if the v500s break every year i may just have to convince my parents to buy him the same model of headphones i own ( which i saved up for and bought with my own money ) .
average at best , if you are using for djing , you might want to consider another headphone unless the mixer have a
i am having to put both left and right sides of headphone on to hear the cue track
hope that helps .
sony dj version of the headset and up has been great quality in terms of strong cabling material and durable ear piece
my first headset last me more than <NUM> years
that is with normal wear and tear
its worth it
the price is not expensive and generally can not be compared with expensive bose headphones or the higher headset from sony
it perfectly price for it purpose , not expensive and works better than the ear bugs piece .
you will be very pleased with the quality of the sound from these headphones
good cord length to
priced right .
well , i embarked on finding a new set of travel headphones after my last long plane ride
the earbuds just weren not hacking it , even though the pair i have are quite good
the jet engine noise finally got to me
i have an old pair of sony headphones which are quite good , but i wanted something new
so , i studied what was available and settled on the headphones
after purchasing a pair , i regret my choice and i am returning them
when i got these headphones , i immediately plugged them into my ipod and picked a favorite cut from xtc ( mayor of simpleton )
as i listened to the song , i kept wondering what was wrong , then , it dawned on me , the treble was entirely muffled
i grabbed the and did a test with several tracks
same result
the has little or no
just as a sanity check , i grabbed my sony phones and did the same test
i consider the one of the best headphones ever made by the way
yeah , the bass was definitely richer than the , which seem bright in comparison , but both were much closer to what i expected than the
i thought it might be the ipod , so picked a coupled of cds ( mfsl dark side of the moon & bernstein in symphony no
9 ) to try in my portable cd player
same result
while the was the brighest of the three , the lack of high end on the made neither cd sound good
once again , the was the best and most balanced of the three
still seeking the perfect lightweight headphones , i went to a local magnolia to try a better comparison
i tried both noise cancelling models from sony , several sennheiser models , the , , and
first of all , forget the noise cancelling models
none of them sounded as good as
the was the best of them all and reminded me of the ( which i understand they replaced )
the is definitely better than the by a long shot , and i would say the is comparable to sennheiser
i am going to try them at home soon
although many of the sennheiser phones sounded good , they seemed compared to the
the only one that was close in price and quality was the
by the way , the was uncomfortable and put a lot of pressure on my head
unless you like listening to bass only , do not buy the headphones .
i have been beating these around for <NUM> years now and they are just as great as the day i bought them
still intact no sign of wear and tear
love the fold up design
glad to see they are still making these .
these sound awesome , and i am not a dj
i was just looking for some old fashioned , ear thumping headphones
i love the way that they fold up and i love the strength in the cord
the only negative thing that i have to say is the ear sweat you will suffer from having these on your head as you rock out .
if it is music , gaming , movies , or whatever , these headphones are great
comfortable to wear with high quality music
the swival ears are great if you need to keep one ear semi open to hear events around you
only negative would be the ear pieces tend to fit on the ear as opposed to around them .
anyone looking to purchase these headphones should note : they were designed and advertised for dj use specifically
and by dj , i mean the variety , not the variety
and , for djs , these headphones are excellent
the actual physical configuration of the headphones is clearly designed for dj use , with easily folding , individually rotating cups for monitoring
they are also designed to rest close to the ear which , although it may make your ears hot and uncomfortable if you use them for prolonged home listening , is ideal for djs because they effectively cancel noise up to extremely high volumes ( i have used these in both a small party and club setting , and have found the cancellation to be more than adequate for both )
the actual sound styling is typical of sony , with the quality generally reflecting the price
i listen to a variety of music through these : in addition to hip hop &amp ; house for club use , i listen to various other electronica , various rock , lots of acoustic music and a ton of a capella
the headphones perform admirably in all cases
the bass is strong without being overbearing , the mids are balanced and the highs are clear without being ringy or piercing
please note my initial admonition again , however : these headphones are designed for djs
for your money , you can probably find a better set for home use by sennheiser , or similar , which aren not geared torward performance/studio use
in addition , other reviewers are right : the headphones get uncomfortable after prolonged use ( i found that after about <NUM> minutes to an hour of home use , i felt the need to take them off and massage my ears for a bit , as these fit tight and are a bit heavy )
the only reason i would ever recommend against these for djs is if you plan on spinning for an extraordinarily extended period of time , because they are slightly heavier than the v600s and the extra weight , while usually unnoticable , can become an issue if you are spinning upwards of five or six hours .
i am an international dj doing trance , rave , d&b , ambient , and dubstep
i have owned these headphones for <NUM> years and they truly never fail me
no matter how hard the bass drop , no matter how long a trance chorus , they have never popped a speaker and never quit
if you are a real dj and you need a headphone that will last you past a decade then get a pair of these
armin van buuren doesn not use them for no reason , and other professional dj is know where its at ; sony is .
this is a professional dj headphone that is seen on numerous djs , even after having been taken out of commission from sony ( update model is the sony /br )
the ear cups can be comfortably moved around on your ears as well as worn in a way that lets you listen in on one piece while hearing the output on external speakers
they can also be folded in for easy traveling and are light for their size
as for the sound , and house music sounds great although i wouldn not use these for jazz or classical
and although these cans were not introduced as headphones , they do a very good job at it anyway
i have used them while traveling on flights as well as on subways and almost never hear outside noise
plus , they achieve this without making your ears feel uncomfortable
overall , great product for recording/mixing or general listening purposes .
this headsets retails from sony for $149
99 which is not bad at all
the fact you can get em cheaper here is simply a plus
the cord is a <NUM> foot coiled cord that does carry some weight but is not to much to handle
the ear cup design is great , most sound becomes blocked out even before the music starts
the leakage isn not bad when the cups are over your ears but it does leak if a cup is exposed
the overall construction is pretty solid
they are plastic but seem to be pretty heavy duty
they flip up out and in nicely making a perfect fit for one under the chin or on the back of the head if you are trying to que up
you will hear sounds that you didn not know exsisted before
i am not making that up either
these headphones are designed for dj is to use while playing , that means they have to hear every line in the song
i have seen some people say that they aren not good for portability but i say their wrong
yeah they are big headphones but no less portable than the beats by dre that take up just as much space
i highly recommend these head phones to any one willing to get rid of their ear buds .
i am a professional dj , and i have been using my mdr
4700dj for almost ten years
they are the best dj monitor headphones i have owned
i know many new products ( such as the popular pioneers ) have come out since ; and to be honest , i haven not tried many of them ; but these sure beat all the cans i used in the past
when you first get them , you might get confused about how to fold them back up
i think i was confused for a little , but maybe i am just not that bright
the sound is great , and the construction is definitely solid .
and still going strong
i love these headphones
i have traveled with them a lot
i put them on and i am transferred to a different world , a tranquil world
i will buy another pair when these expire
: )
i bought these in a local store probably in <NUM> or 3
they have made it to/from many lans and halfway across the country
they are used on a daily basis and abused from time to time
never once have i had a complaint about these
great sound and great build , don not hesitate to purchase .
the design is by far the best part of these headphones
they are very clean and appealing to the eye - and they fit on your skull like a glove
they seem fairly durable but who knows - they may break tomorrow
that would be a con
the sound is pretty clean and detailed at high volumes , but definitely distorts at very high volumes
especially with the bass up
bass is not as impressive as you would hope for this price , but bass isn not everything
the acoustics are nothing short of a amazing in comparison to other the cheap sets i have owned
pros - style , fit , storage , crisp full soundcons - , poor bass , tight fit on head , distortion at high volumes* update * ( december 24 , 2012 ) these haven not broken yet - guess they aren not as fragile as i though
they still work great and have gone through mild abuse .
i bought these headphones for there great specs which they live up to
i listen primarily to classical music , but these are good for rock and pop as well
the bass is big , deep , and roomy
your amplifier doesn not need much power to drive these and you can drive them to deafening loudness levels with no distortion
even with the remarkable bass there is excellent imaging in the midrange and treble
the bass doesn not overpower the rest of the frequency range
right now i am on the fence as which i would recommend : these sony 700 is or the sony 7506 is
the 7506 is just seem a tad more accurate
if you are into rock or pop more and like beefier bass then i would opt for the 700 is
i have no long term use with either
so i will defer to others as far as long term durability .
bought this phone just for casual usage , to listen music and movies at home
on the plus side , the quality is awesome , excellent bass and good isolation from external noises
on the minuses , this thing is bulky and super heavy
it causes too much pressure on your head and hurts just a few minutes after putting them on
also the cups make way too much heat , and you can barely stay with them on after an hour or so
it may be a good headphone for djs ( that are constantly putting them on and off ) , but for continuous usage there may be better options .
i bought this item nearly <NUM> years ago in a supermarket for <NUM> eur ( ~$450 ) when it was brand new ! they are awesome headphones , about <NUM> years down the road the rubber starts peeling off , revealing the fabric to cover the ears
these headphones are quite loud , but 24ohms , so they are not as loud as a <NUM> ohms headphones , but make up for their sound quality
they are very neutral phones , sounding quite even in the whole register
if you are mainly doing techno and house stuff , you might as well go with the much cheaper sennheiser hd505 , not for sale anymore
they have the sennheiser <NUM> which are very close to the 505 is
soundwise they sound about just as good , little less mids , just as loud ( if not louder ) , just as good lowend , crisper brights
i find the senheisers better sounding than these sony is , although these sony is sound more linear , less crisp , more evened out in sound
these sony is are better for overall listening , like a variety of styles ranging from classic , to jazz , to pop etc
the senheisers are better for techno , house , pop , dance , r&b ; , hiphop etc
if i can compare these <NUM> headphones ( as they are all i have to compare eachother with ) , i'd go for the senheisers , because they are less than a quarter the price of these sony is and overall just as good
if you are an audiophile , wanting to get the best , obviously these sony is are better , but not by much
in fact , most people might not even hear the difference even if they had to a/b them .
i bought these because they were one of a few sony models that have 50mm drivers
my set has been flying colors all the way , so sony may as well have already had my money for these
in hindsight , i should have shopped more or been willing to spend more money
i am not a dj but i selected these based on the specs for sound quality
great sound they have in abundance , comfort they do not
my ears got quite uncomfortable and did so quite quickly
i had some foam padding handy , so i cut some foam rings and inserted them under the covers and now i can wear them longer
they still get uncomfy after a while but it is not as bad
my only other con is the cord
it would have been nice if it were removable and it would be more functional to me if it were not coiled
i'd rather have the slack than the tension
since i have not owned these for a long time , i can not speak for the structural integrity issues that i have read about , but i don not really travel with them
with any luck i will get more than a few years out of them
if you don not plan to use them for long periods of time , or if you have some spare foam padding lying around , you might have trouble finding better sounding headphones for the price
the 50mm drivers make a noticeable difference .
these headphones are a must buy
they are very comfortable and have really good sound
i use them for music , games , movies , and tv shows that i play on my computer and the sound is terrific
they have just the right amount of bass , and are really good for games especially
i would recommend these headphones to anyone
in order for these headphones to last they have to be taken care of really carefully because the plastic that holds the cups on will crack if you are careless
overall , these headphones are a great purchase and i will buy these again .
i bought these back in <NUM> and never get sick of them ! can crank them up full blast without <NUM> distortion ! they make everything and anything sound so much better ! and actually has a cord long enough so you can stand up , walk around , an dance , which they will make you want to do , when you are wearing them ! the fact that they are that good and there must not be anything comparable being made probably explains why the price has skyrocketed since i bought mine .
i have a set of the sony mdrv700dj studio monitor headphones that i use for sound while playing my bass guitar
they are incredable and simply can not be beat
i have used other " units" from other manufacturers and nothing comes close ! i would recommend these headphones for fellow musicians , for audiophiles , for basic music listening
they simply can not be beat for the sound quality , bass reproduction .
first off these headphones have the same sound technology as the sony professional headphones ! the only difference is that these have a dj style
i also enjoy the slinky/coil type of cord
i enjoy the headphones very much !
i was looking for an upgrade from my tinny sounding jvcs
the sound quality is far superior to the jvc and the music doesn not sound like its coming from a tin can
my only complaint is as one other reviewer mentioned , the comfort
after a little while the phones become painful around the ears
this may be due to the weight or the design
still , i will use these headphones as long as they last or i cant stand the discomfort any longer
as far as the cost , i bought mine for $36
00 direct from china via ebay
not bad .
it is unfortunate that these are being discontinued ( if they haven not been already ) because these are awesome
i have long since let mine go , but i regret it everyday
i recently got some skullcrushers and i think they are okay , for the price , but man
i really wish i still had these
i have to say though , some of these prices are kinda outrageous , but they hold up really well , so a gently used one is a very good option
good luck , and keep on the beat !
these are fantastic
i am a dj , but now find myself toting these around everywhere because i just don not want to listen to my music without them
my fiance is not a dj , but steals these from me all the time
- they can take way more volume than you can likely handle without distortion
- they are sturdy , have a coily cord that is only connected at the left ear , and fold neatly into a little bad ( included )
- they totally block out outside noise
at a gig , you can not hear what you are pumping over the speakers if you don not want to
at a coffee shop , no one can tell your music is outrageously loud
- intense rich bass
even when you really crank the volume , it is like the bass vibrates your head , instead of blasting your eardrums
a really neat little trick with these is to put them on full volume , and hold the ear cups together
you can barely hear a thing , but you can feel the bass thumping in your hands
when you open them , you will be shocked at how much volume they are putting out
one last note , i bought the 1000 is , was disappointed , and bought these
definitely the way to go .
these are the most bass heavy headphones i have ever used , and i have used and owned a lot of high end headphones , including grado up to , sennheiser , , , , , , and a high end denon of which i can not remember the model number
for a bass enthusiast this set is what i'd recommend - sony aren not as clear at the higher end sennheisers i have owned , but they are at least in the same ball park of quality ( they aren not destroyed by the sennheisers as far as clarity , but they do have much more bass than the sennheisers
sennheiser prides itself on making a flat eq ( meaning , typically not much bass
) if you are a bass hound just sick with these sonys
i had a high end pair of denon is too and they weren not as all around good as the sony is in my opinon
with the 50mm drivers you can actually feel them vibrating on your head with a good bass lick --- i have never felt that with any pair of headphones
they are quite comfortable too ! use caution when buying these headphones used or on ebay
there are a lot of imitation chineese ripoff brands that are exceptionally cheap in build quality in comparison , but look like a very good counterfeit
most negative reviews on these headphones have got to be from the chineese knockoff imitations sold new and used on ebay , because my set is over a year old now and work perfectly after being dropped a couple times even
they are durable , and imo of very high quality .
i got this for a friend over a year ago & barely now they are showing signs of use
sony deff made a good job on this one
the bass lines are so neat & clear
and no matter how high you put the volume , still sounds clean .
like other reviews , the swivel points for the ear cups are plastic and will eventually break
mine did
buyer is remorse scale : 9
5 ( 10 being worst ) don not waste your money !
these headphones are very clean
highs are crisp and lows offer no distortion
however , the low end response is not so good
at normal listening levels , i would like a lot more bass response and it is not there
if you crank up the volume , then the bass starts coming in
but i don not listen to music that way
hope this helps in making a decision
if i had it to do over , i would have bought something different .
i have tried a lot of headphones and earbuds over the years
i returned four different pairs of various brands before i bought these sonys
they blow the competition at this price away , and lots of more expensive models as well
i have had mine for over two years and they are in pristine condition
i use them almost every day and drag them around everywhere with me and they have held up admirably
the balance and sound quality are exquisite , and i don not hand out compliments that easily .
the bass is really heavy on these
the build quality is not that great
i think they look really cool
i had to adjust the bass on my stereo because my ears were getting fatigued and gave me a headache , after i did that i didn not have the problem again
these are designed for dj is
if you want something to listen to at home and you aren not worried about sound leakage get some open air cans
the sennheiser hd600 ( $260 ) are some of the best around
if you really want closed headphones in $120 price range get the sony studio monitor series headphones
sony headphones are notorious for the ear pads falling apart
it took me a lot of time and money before i found the sound experience i wanted
always listen before you buy , everyone has different preferences in sound
if you are serious about music check out the sennheiser hd 650 , seriously amazing
you might consider pairing it with a headphone amp ( this is not a portable setup )
i'd check out the schiit asgard , they have a <NUM> day trial or something , but there are many , many other ones out there and you might be happy without out it
i picked up an old stereo receiver for $30 .
sound quality is amazing
noise reduction is pretty good too , can not hear anything once i have these bad boys on .
forget what you have read , these are the best dj headphones in the market ( i should know , i am a dj )
i have had the same pair for two years straight
i am guessing that the people who say they are flimsy doesn not take care of them
now for the review : they are very comfortable , they are loud ( just the way i like it ) because of their design , you don not hear the ambient noise at all ( love that )
if you are a dj , the single cup function is great
now the money maker : the bass , you just don not hear the bass , you feel it , they actually vibrate when the bass kicks in
in my opinion , these are the best headphones ever !
i bought a pair at a box store at least <NUM> years ago
i think there great
i live in an apartment now and i use them a lot more than i did when i had my own place .
i always order these
they seem to last longer for me than they do for other people
maybe it is in the care , i don not know
i keep using these and they never fail me .
for the price , these headphones are very hard to beat in terms of sound and comfort
i highly recommend them .
i have had these headphones for more almost <NUM> years now
i am no audiophile but i can hear my <NUM> kbps mp3 files far better on these headphones as compared to my creative l3800 ( 2
1 ) speakers
and by "light user" i mean at least one hour of use everyday
because these perform better than my desktop speakers i have them plugged in pretty much all the time
the extra long , cord is useful even for home use ( though its really a lot sometimes ! )
and i dont need to set my mp3 player volume greater than <PERCENT> of max ( iaudio x5 ) to get excellent sound
yes i agree they are not built that solid
even though mine are in great condition , you can still feel its mostly plastic
but i have traveled with these headphones and i have also fallen asleep wearing them
i have also experienced no problems whatsoever with the ear cups/padding
maybe i just got lucky !
i have been using this product for about <NUM> years now , i both the first pair in 2005 , and still used it until last year when one of the cups , died on me
i tried a bunch of headphones but after analyzing the price and what they offer overall i decided to buy another pair of sony is
they have not hailed me in in all this years , swivels are great sound is amazing , it is all a matter of taste , and sound and as a professional dj this is my choice , i would recommend it to anybody
at the time i have both this , it came packed in the original package and on time .
great bass
very comfortable even after hours and hours of listening
i use them for my studio work
sound is completely isolated when they are on your head or cupped together , so there is very little bleed
they are a little tight , so if you have a fat head , these might not be for you
they look great , but handle them with a bit of care , since they are plastic and seem a little prone to breaking due to the many moving parts .
i just purchased the sonys and i am excited to share the experience
first , i have owned several different headphones in past , the last being the sony
i thought it would be impossible to improve on them
but sony has done it
comfort : the 700s are comfortable
the earcups fit around your ears , so there is no annoying pressure there
the headband is nicely padded too , so you simply forget you are wearing anything at all
they are 'hefty' and robustly constructed , yet that weight simply disappears once you put them on
they are attractively designed , too
with a professional style
sound quality : like i said earlier , sony has worked magic here
the resolution and detailing these phones provide will have you hearing things "for the first time"
you will hear things in music you never knew existed
i am pulling things out of my collection and literally enjoying them for the first time
the bass extension is phenomenal
a concert bass or pipe organ will have you giggling like a kid ! but they don not stop there
the mids and highs are equally
the phones are fairly sensitive too
my small headphone amp drives them quite nicely to db levels that doctors would tell you " ! " but they sound so good
you wanna keep cranking the volume ! sony thoughtfully provided a nice long cord , too
it is coiled so it doesn not get in the way
oh , my
the kickdrum in led zeppelin is "when the levee breaks" just about blew my eyeglasses off ! yeehaw ! buy them
you will not regret it !
i just bought my second pair
it looks like the build quality is about the same as it was before
i am a dj who loves music , and use these for all my work , and these have awesome sound
there are a few problems with them , however
if you are a dj who monitors loudly , and you forget to turn them down after mixing , the drivers can and will eventually blow ! in addition , the round plastic cylinders with the l and r labels at the top of them break , and that is why i finally had to buy a new pair , but not bad for <NUM> years of use and abuse ! sound quality wise , if you are not a dj there are better headphones out there
if money is no object , get the bose quietcomfort <NUM> headphones , much better , and filters out all the sound around you ! but if you are a dj , these headphones are a must ! i have talked to hundreds of other dj is , and they all have bought the denons , technics , pioneer , and other brands of dj headphones that cost the same or more , and they have all told me that those headphones do not hold up as good as the sony is did
too bad the dj headphone makers don not take note of this and make a better quality product .
i will keep it simple folks ! i bought them , i tried them , i love 'em ! very versatile so far ! i am no sound expert , but i know what i like ! and these sony is are great ! i also plan to try the beyerdynamics 770ts with <NUM> ohms and compare sound quality and comfort ! shipping was fast and my phones were in mint condition upon arrival ! thanks again amazon !
i dj all the time and i needed something that i felt would not steer me wrong
so these are the headphones that were recomended to me from a friend who is a dj also
i can turn and fold in about any direction you think of , and gives you a great quality of sound at the same time
i dont think i'd be able to get the same satifaction with any other headphones
i mean , what else can i ask for ? !
all great
you will pay a little more
but well worth it
i hope they last ! the sound quality , as well as the durability make this product a hit !
i am not exactly a headphone connoisseur but i can tell you that these headphones have impressive sound
i upgraded from the standard issue ipod earbuds
the bass on these things is quite strong ( its actually rather painful at anything too high )
however , if you read the reviews for these things you will find that the common theme is that they break around the swivel thing
i was determined to be the dude who takes good care of his headphones and doesn not break them
not so
although these are some of the sexiest phones around , they are not made to last
the plastic on the hinge/swivel device is completely inadequate for its purpose
mine lasted only about a month
the sound still sounds fine , but the swivels are in shambles
dont buy these if you want them for longer than a couple of months
for the price , the longevity of these is a shame .
i have had my headphones for <NUM> years
i am an amature dj and could only recommend these for dj use
1st of all , the major complaint about these headphones are the cracks that appear on the swiveling brace
face it , it is plastic and it can break
and it is not the best design for durability
but it is not gonna happen to everybody
as a matter of fact , a lot of record stores with turntable sampling stations will have these headphones out for use
a local record shop in hb had about a dozen of these headphones out for years of careless use
i think , most people end up sitting on or packing them in heavy luggage
i can not see how you can just put these on top of your head and break them
2nd , they are not designed for audiophile sound quality at moderate volumes
they are designed to monitor the next song while listening to blaring 15" club speakers
a device with mediocre output voltage will not move these 50mm drivers well enough to get good sound quality
so stay away from ipods
they are just not gonna drive these headphones really well
imagine hooking up two 12" subwoofers to your car and trying to power them with your headunit
it is not gonna happen
like i said , these are specifically designed for dj is
i use a vestax mixer and i get crisp , studio monitor quality sound
very transparent and smooth lows
3rd , as for the 50mm drivers
these headphones are designed for accurate and distortion free playback at loud volumes assuming you have a clear and strong output
there are other headphones out there that have 50mm drivers that are designed for moderate volume levels
a lot of it is going to depend on the sensitivity of the drivers
usually , lower sensitivity will handle louder volume levels better but a higher sensitivity unit will sound more accurate at lower levels
so if you are not using headphones to monitor songs at a concert or at a club , go and spend your money on something else .
update : [ june 2011]after the swivel joints broke back in <NUM> ( around three years of use ) , i was able to easily put them back using super glue
since then , i have purchased and used other headphones but still occasionally use the v700 headphones
it is definitely very worn out--the ( replaceable ) padding is cracked and the fit feels a bit loose--but , they still sound great and the joints have not broken off again
yeah , after it was literally , they prove to stand strong with some glue on the joints--i have dj'd with them , slept with them , and dropped them and i am still using them with joy
it is been with me for over ten years ! i got it a few years after i graduated from college ( dj'd with them ) and now i am almost <NUM> with <NUM> kids and , i still use them ! amazing
now , i will use them with care
{original "review" from 2004]when i first purchased these headphones back in 1998 , i would have given these earphones <NUM> stars
but after around <NUM> years of use , the swivels broke
the swivels are made of plastic , so the first place that falls apart is the swivel joint that connects to the cups
both left and right joints are cracking after approximately three years of moderate use
luckily , it is still functional even with the cracks
the problem is that it is now a bit looser so it falls off from my head even more frequently
and we all know that these earphones ( including the v600 ) are notorious when it comes to the deterioration of the padding on the ear cups
i just wish that it would last just a bit longer
i have been looking to replace these and i found the new pioneer to be a possibility
it sounds just as good , it is definitely lighter and stays on the head steadier ; and even though the construction is similar in that it is plastic , the swivel joints are built differenly from the v700djs which makes me think they knew about this sony is problem and they have found a way to prevent the joints from cracking .
i brought these headphones for my son
he wanted a dj type headphone
i compare it to my denon ahd 1001s
the sony sound presentation was "good" , however i was not engaged with the music and recording like with the denon
the sony does produce an accurate sound presentation
the sound didn not have a heavy colored bass or treble ( neutral )
the sony may not be an audiophile headphone , definitely it is a great studio monitor dj headphone .
i just purchased my second pair after neglecting to maintain my old pair
the old ones still sound great , but unfortunately i didn not bother to maintain the leather part of the headphones well , so they started cracking , and after dropping them , one of the swivels stopped working , so they didn not stay on right
with minimal precautions , you too can make these last for years and years - just apply some leather protector once in a while , and take care not to drop the things carelessly on the floor
these things are the best headphones i have ever owned , and it was well worth another $100 to purchase a second pair
the first pair served me well , and actually sound great still - they are just not comfortable , due in no part to the quality of the headphones themselves
they are solid , and it is nice to have a cord on only one side
it really gets in your way a lot less than the typical headphone design with a cord on each side
highly recommend these even for those of you who aren not djs
these are perfect for drowning out the sound of my coworkers at my desk
i can not hear a thing , and people are always waving their arms at me to get my attention
these have an amazing level of bass , better than any i have heard in any headphones before
it is an experience , these are .
i tested this in sony showroom and even in the noisy atmosphere the sound quality was too good with big noise reduction due to the closed cups
so i ordered one for myself and one for my friend
the products arrived in good condition
i started testing it with many of my audio and video collections both from my laptop and mp3 player and the sound quality was top notch
like many other reviewers i too heard several new sounds from the same old songs ! the bass is excellent and at the same time high end instruments are also heard very clearly
excellent purchase for the pricing ( about $84 from amazon ) with free shipping except for the below issue
but then i found an issue with my head set and my friend is one too has the same problem
it is the clicking noise which i can clearly hear in my ears when the cup moves if i move my jaw or my ears involuntarily
and many times i hear that even when i move my head but not all the times
this is fine during music but too annoying to me during movies
i have a good sized head ( ! ) and there is no play when the headphone sits on my head
it is having a very good fit
haven not seen others writing about this
can anyone share their opinion ? mine are just <NUM> days old and i am worried if this will increase over period of time .
really good set of cans
very good overall
all genres
these things need power to perform at there best , amp hungry
they are not my ultrasone pro <NUM> or pro 750
but they make an awesome set for a family set headphone .
i just want to echo what a lot of reviewers have said
the sound is absolutely first rate ! music no longer feels like it is around you , you are part of it
bass sounds absolutely crisp and clean , not muddled and washed out like some other headphones i have used
highs and midtones are well represented
pretty much perfect for any sort of music , be it electronic , rock , or classical
i used to game with these headphones on my pc as well , which completely spoiled me
but like others have said , wear and tear seem to plague this pair of headphones
i don not dj , but i do use my headphones on a regular basis and my first pair eventually formed cracks near one of the earpiece joints which was the beginning of the end
my second pair is demise was my own fault , having fallen asleep with them on and somehow twisting them in just the appropriate direction to break off a joint
other than the joints , however , i am pretty happy with the ear pads
given the amount of wear , the pads have held up quite well , where other cheaper headphones have eventually fallen apart due to heat and perspiration
, i'd rate them a <NUM> out of 5
they feel pretty much like what they look like
part of the great sound is because they pretty much cup your head pretty snugly and feel pretty comfortable for the first several hours
however , after an extended period , your ears are ready for a break from being mashed to your head
i don not rate them too badly on this , mainly because there are other headphones which are pure orture compared to the sonys
if you are looking for comfort , i would suggest the bose triport headphones which sells in a similar range or the more expensive quiet comfort <NUM> ( which adds noise cancelling )
although i can not speak for wear'n tear , i have tried out the triports at my friends place and i currently own a pair of qc2 ( mainly because i needed noise cancellation for reasons ) , and these two pairs of headphones are unmatched for comfort
however , for pure sound , i preferred the sony is by far
i will probably pick up another pair of these sony is soon , because writing about them make me miss them
so my bottom line ? pros : 1 ) sound - my favorite sounding pair to date by far ! 2 ) portability - they fold up nicely and come with a travel pouch3 ) comfort - reasonably comfortable for extended periods4 ) durable ear pads5 ) sound6 ) sound7 ) sound8 ) sound9 ) sound10 ) soundcons : 1 ) quick wear'n tear on the plastic joints , so careful with twisting the earpieces too much2 ) high price for such fragilityfor such an pricy pair , sony should have constructed these headphones better , but at least for me , the sound is definitely worth it .
this review is to address the issue of these headphones breaking , and only that , because quite frankly i could go on for days about how well these headphones work for djing and everyday listening
stuff breaks , this is a fact of life
cars break , dishes break , and even people break , these headphones are no different
expecting them to last a lifetime because of the pricetag is simply naive
there is also a difference between breaking beyond function and a simple annoying break like the plastic cracking
these headphones will surely enough one day die completely as in loss of function , but up to that point they will begin to fall apart
the swivel housings are the most common thing to break but from reading the reviews here on amazon it is as if people have never heard of duct tape or they are so appalled by the idea of $100+ headphones breaking that they refuse to do anything but complain about it
the pioneer hdj1000s break , the senheisers break , and if you can find me headphones that don not break then i applaud your discovery of solid titanium headsets that don not exist
this all boils down to one thing and one thing only , how well do you treat your possesions ? if you are like me and you don not mangle everything you own then a $80-$150 pair of headphones is a safe investment , because it will last
if you just play wild shows all the time , wear these skating/snowboarding , throw them in your backpack , or whatever then you are a moron to buy them and expect them to not break
nowhere in the description of this product does it say these things are as solid as a tank
it states that they are flexible ( they are ) , have a good bass range ( they do ) , and they are comfortable ( they are for me but that is a personal thing )
don not be deterred by reviews saying these things break , because everything does and every comparable set of headphones is equally flawed
the hdj1000s get loose sliding fixtures really quick , the senheiser 280s sound overall better but they feel like a plastic toy and really aren not much better
if you are a dj your options are the v700s and hdj1000s , there is a reason they are the industry standards
they are time tested and proven
if you aren not willing to buy a few good pairs of headphones then djing is not the hobby for you because you will break your stuff many times , not just your headphones
well there is my rant , these headphones do exactly what they say they do and for that i give them a 5/5 .
these will break on you , very quickly - believe me - i am a dj that is given up and decided to go to the 280 is ! what happens is that in a short period and even after taken care of these , the swivel cups/plastic thing will crack and break and the cups will no longer fit closely to your head
they will then be useless and since this usually happens shortly after a year you will no longer have your mfr is warranty ! countless other dj is will tell you the same thing , save your money and get something better -- the hd 280 is sound better , fit better , and give you more value for your money
they are cheaper and parts are easily available and easily replaceable
unlike sony is 700 is
do the right thing , don not buy these ! you will be happy you listened to my advice !
first off i'd like to say that these headphones are very nice quality
i am not an audiophile but i do have a pair of headphones on during most of the day
playing computer games ( wow , cod , fallout , etc ) and listening to music , watching videos i prob average wearing these headphones for about hours a day
my beef is they are not comfortable wearing beyond a <NUM> hour duration
the combination of having the ear padding too soft/short and the pressure that they put on each ear i have to take them off after because of the pain they produce wearing for long periods of time
i still use them on a daily basis , mostly because they were so expensive to buy in the first place i can not just set them off to the side and use something else
but after using these for a few months i might have to second hand sell them and look for something else that is more comfortable
to your average user these will be a good set of headphones , but to the guy like me who wears headphones for most of the day , i'd suggest looking for a more comfortable set of headphones .
i wanted to refute what i have read on here about these being for dj use
i couldn not disagree more
i hate dance , rap and anyting to do with a club or dj
these phones are excellent for rock or anything i have tested them on
tried out hendrix , floyd , zeppelin , metallica , megadeth , marley , janes addiction , maiden and more and i have absolutely no complaints
i can maybe notice a little about the mids being overpowered in a few spots but the base and highs sound so freakin' good it blows me away
i cannot compare the 7506 is but may have purchased those if i had done more research first
you really can not go wrong with these
i can not speak for the durability but after reading the reviews i will not fold them up and plan on using them at home <PERCENT> of the time
the sound quality of these is astounding
don not believe the negative rants .
i have been buying these for over <NUM> years now
this is my third pair
no , they are not crappy
i traveled to less than favorable places under less than favorable conditions and beat the ever living crap out of them
a product can only make it so far
i don not baby my stuff
having said all that , i have no regrets
i love these , they are so loud you can set them on the table in a room and still hear them on full blast
i will continue to buy this headset even when the next ones break
love these
i love these headphones , as well as the headphones
i believe the oil from your skin over time will cause the coating to slough off of the earphone padding skin
however , since hygiene is of utmost importance , especially if more than one person is using the headphones , i have purchased some sanitary headphone covers
this not only keeps the headphones clean , it also makes the headphone ear pads last forever
just an idea , but try using sanitary headphone covers on all your headphones
i believe you can buy a bag of <NUM> for about $18
it is definitely worth protecting these wonderful headphones
i use them in my home studio , and the frequency response is excellent , and i can hear every note , not to mention the exceptional large drivers ( ) that the headphones contain .
no the sony does not compare to the sony mdr7506 model at all
in fact the v600 model has much more quality sounding bass , much smoother sounding mid range , and a higher high end
in fact the sony mdr7506 headphones are very flat sounding and i suppose they are made only for studio monitoring and recording and mastering
but i am sure the mdr7506 are not good for either purpose
just look at the frequency response specs and they will tell you the real difference between the two of these headphones
one is for music and the other i am not sure what they are good for ? i own the mdr7506 and they sound completely flat and dull , completely lifeless
these headphones are comfortable but can get hot in the summer , its pleather and not real leather
i suppose if you are real handy you can make real leather ear pads for this and sell them too online ? anyone here listening ? you can replace the ear pads when they wear out
but do not buy the ebay replacement ear pads , they do not fit right and easily slip off
not even the same quality as the original sony ear pads
i suggest getting them from sony instead
i use to use these sony headphones for listening to all music , studio mixing , and for recording vocals etc
but now i prefer exclusively the jvc harx700 headphones instead , they are the most accurate and perfect sounding headphones i have ever heard
the jvc harx700 blows away anything sony produces at any price , the quality of the build is excellent , and are more comfortable , and at 1/8 the price of these sony headphones .
i used to have these along time ago
when i first got them , they were better than my other headphones i used to own
these headphones have some serious bass and treble , and dj is still use these headphones
they are great for part <NUM> broadcasting , and hosting holiday parties when queing up a song
they are good for remixing , shuffling music , and running a small fm or am station
also these headphones are good for the shortwave radio listener and ham radio operator
they are the best ! i hope i can get another pair soon .
i have had my pair of v600 is for at least <NUM> years and they still sound great
there is a bit of wear and tear and i take good care of my things
they were with me on many outings including packing them accross europe and they have held up
the thin black stuff has peeled off a bit , but it does not affect sound quality or comfort
so lets see , <NUM> years at $70
at $10 a year , i am very happy with this purchase
edit ( 6/14/11 ) : i still have these though i don not use them very often
too bulky and the cord is very long
they still sound great though after all these , wow 13+ years ! these things are as old as my cat who is now on prescription food for his feline diabetes
in other words , they have held up better than a slightly neglected pet .
incredible headphones
i am not an expert on sound like some of the other reviewers , but i love to listen to music
my office can get a bit noisy at times and these headphones do the trick
after a full <NUM> hours my ears are a little tired from the headphones sitting on them , but i usually don not wear them all day
the ear covers are soft and made from a very comfortable material
the sound is amazing ! i think i can hear more music through these headphones than i do my stereo system at home
cable has two adapters to fit most sized jacks
it is long enough to plug into my pc and still give me room to work comfortably and move around from phone to filing cabinet and back to pc with no troubles
great buy , i am really impressed with these headphones
highly recommended .
wonderful wearing this headphone for long period of time ( i used it for more than two hrs most of the time )
clear and has great bass when turned up volume
highly recommend this item .
although they come nowhere near the calibre of sennheiser headphones , the mdrv600s perform admirably for the amount of money they cost
the highs are crystal clear , the mids unmuddy , and the bass is pretty good ( although i personally found it a bit underpowered , which is why these receive only four stars , and not five )
perhaps more importantly , these headphones are extraordinarily comfortable and fit snugly around your ears , making them ideal for home use and extended listening ( unlike the v700s , which are designed to be used during live dj performances , and therefore be worn mostly over only one ear )
if you are an average home user looking for a great set of headphones to listen to your mp3 collection or your big , booming new dvds with , these are the ones for you .
this is my second pair of headphones
there is absolutely no comparison with the first , because this one has to be approximately 284x better
the bass , like everyone said , is crisp and clear , but not exactly booming with the lows
in other words , it is not the same as car subs
the sound quality , however , is absolutely incredible
i am able to hear certain noises in music and gaming that i haven not ever heard from my speakers
the headphones aren not technically noise cancellation , but i can not hear a single thing anyone is saying when they are standing next to me
i don not even have the noise that loud ! there are a couple complaints i have about this product , but they are minor
first , the design of the headphones are shaped to fit ones ears
because of that , it isn not possible to wear them the other way
luckily , the cord is very long and coils up so it won not tangle up
the second complaint i have is that my ears become extremely hot and uncomfortable after just <NUM> minutes or so
to combat that , i just take them off for a good <NUM> seconds and it is fine again
it does get annoying though
i am no audiophile so i can not judge the quality in comparison to other headphones , but i would most certainly buy this product again .
i first bought the sony mdr v6 over a decade ago and was so taken by their performance , that i invested in the v600 a few months ago
i have not been disappointed
if you are looking to combine your digital music listening experience ( cds , mp3s , etc ) with a top notch pair of headphones or looking to enhance your movie watching experience ( on a laptop for example ) with a state of the art pair of headphones , look no further
the highs and the lows are captured perfectly , adding a hithero unknown dimension to your listening ( and viewing ) pleasure
you certainly cannot go wrong with the price either ! be warned , however , that these headphones are heavy
while , not a problem , should you be sitting in one place and listening to the audio , by no means will you be comfortable walking around in these headphones
( hence the four and not five stars
i have been in the entertainment industry for thirty five plus years
watching to pros around me use these headphones must have stuck in my head
i just started a new business , needed headphones and the mdrv600s became the obvious choice
they are comfortable to wear - have a long cable and seem to reproduce a fine spectrum of natural sound
i love these things
i just wonder why i waited this long
i should have had these to listen to my music a long while ago - there great !
after owning these headphones for over <NUM> months i can tell you that they just don not compare at all to the sony model
the overall sound quality is muddy , flat , and lifeless
the bass tone these cans produce is more of an upper rather than a smooth , tight , and deep bass
the sounds are muddy and offer very little ambient presence to the sound
highs are more harsh sounding rather than clean and precise
if you are buying these mainly to listen to music i'd suggest you look elsewhere as these sound pretty bad
i currently use the sony v6s ( not the v600s ) for listening to music and some studio work and the difference between them is quite dramatic
the build quality and comfort of the sony is about all that is good about them
but , if you want something that sounds accurate for studio monitoring than get the classic sony model ( many studios and radio stations use the sony or the sony headphones for monitoring sound )
they fold up just like the and are just as comfortable
if sound quality is important to you then avoid the sony headphones like the plague
they are horrible .
while shopping for new headphones i just realized i bought this item as a kid--13 years ago ( thanks amazon for reminding me when i have bought something ) ! i am not an audiophile so i wouldn not be able to elaborate on the specifics of sound acoustics but i can tell you this : i have had loud neighbors in the past and these headphones were able to block them out
i have never had any complaints about the quality of the music playing through this
listening to music with this is quite superb ; the bass , and highs are all equally there
as for the build quality , these have definitely stood the test of time
the original material that was surrounding the earpieces and headband have cracked and worn away--this does not affect sound quality
in fact , i think the extra material is on there to make it easy to clean when the headphones get dirty
the cord looks like the day i got it , the printing on the plastic has not worn away
the only minor issue ( and this is mainly because i have read about it from others ) , is creaking sound when turning your head
the cause of this is the plastic twisting and bending
again , i never really noticed it until others pointed it out
i haven not had to replace these for <NUM> years so gather what you will from that statement
i do not *need* new headphones , but i am window shopping should these ever break ( and i hope they don not ! )
i originally bought these for $90 so i am not sure why it is now $200+
if you can get them at a good rate i do recommend these fantastic headphones !
these ear phones are very comfortable and the sound quality is really good too .
i have had these for a long time
excellent product
recently my wife was telling me that i had black dandruff and would knock a few very small pieces of some kind of black material from the side of my face
it took <NUM> months to realize that the specs were coming from the headphone covers
they were slowly deteriorating
the good news is that there are replacement covers for just a few bucks
should be here tomorrow
update : received the new covers and while it was a job putting them on i prevailed
the headphones look brand new
still rate them as a 5
billcape cod
based on people is descriptions , i would guess that about half of these reviews were meant for the
the is the one that is comparable to the , not the v600
if you are not familiar with the mdr line , i can understand how easy it is to confuse the model numbers
i own the v6 and my brother owns the and i have directly compared these and found that are identical physically from what i can tell aesthetically and both have near identical sound
the can be described as the black sheep in the family , since it looks , feels , and sounds very different than its more accomplished siblings
the is much bigger and bulkier than both the v6 and the
while it uses similar drivers , it has a huge earcup and large foam paddings that color the sound
most noticeable is overbearing amount of bass this thing gives out , which drowns out the mids
this would account for some of muddiness that other reviewers have described
so how this headphone got to be called studio monitors is beyond me
this headphone is more like a pair of v6 that was modified to meet the mainstream demands of bassheads
whereas v6 was half metal/half plastic , the v600 is all plastic
on the plus side , the huge earcups do help isolate sound a little better than the v6/7502
if you want accurate sound that you can actually use as monitors , stick with the tried and true sony models such as the v6 or 7502
since the late 80 is , these were among the most widely used monitor headphones in the tv and radio industry .
my first pair lasted <NUM> years
somewhere along the line , sony decided to make the plastic film covering the ear pads thinner , that they would wear out after a year or so and need replacing
most of their headphones are designed this way
after a few months , the ear pads come apart at the seams
within a year , bits of black plastic will begin to tear off and stick to your face
within two years , the ear pads will be completely shredded
these are , overpriced headphones
you will do better with other brands .
i have had <NUM> pairs of these and they are the best
awesome sound reproduction
very "true" reproduction for those of us who scoff at the bass boost buttons
i used both primarily for live sound mixing
but after these it is hard to use anything else in you mp3 player
the size adjustment keeps them comfortable
the flip earphone allows you to hold it up to your ear for a quick listen
the first pair was a travel pair and went on plane flights , car rides , remote shows
after excessive abuse , one of the ear phone joints broke
i repaired it once and that lasted about <NUM> year
the second pair sits on the board at our church
they have been there for years
the ear phone foam is starting to flake off onto those of us with facial hair .
i have had these headphones for a couple of years now
they sound great and are very comfortable , with a earcup lining that means you can wear them for hours
unfortunately , that same , comfortable lining soon began to crack , and is now flaking off in pieces about the size of a dime
the headphones still sound good , are still comfortable , but quite a bit of thin , black plastic came off before i noticed the problem
walking around with stuff like that stuck to the side of your head is not a fashion statement
is is not , as i use them only indoors
i think it may be some kind of fatigue from putting them on and taking them off
so far , it is only happened to the right earcup
the left remains intact
maybe i just have very caustic skin oils , on one side of my head ? i think not
i really liked these headphones soon after i bought them , but now that this has happened i just can not recommend them .
my headphones are a bit worse for wear ( my fault ) but these are my headphones when i really want to enjoy a piece
good frequency response high and low
very comfortable even with use .
i just use this for my amplifier on guitars and ukuleles
guess what
it is ideal
comfortable , quiet for others , true sounds reproduction
i have worn it for , oh , maybe an hour straight , and it is big enough to be comfortable on my ears
it has no funny hissing or such
i am not a earphone guru like some of these reviewers
sometimes too much tech knowledge can be a hindrance to good judgement i , personalty , just wanted a middle priced quality headphone specifically for my amplifier for my high end guitars and ukuleles
this is wonderful
love it
wish i could kiss it
i think i will .
every night , i listen to a cd ( holosync by centerpointe ) while going to sleep
the cd has a range of frequencies , from deep bass ( down to as low as <NUM> hz ) to
also , since i travel frequently , the headphones need to be sturdy
when my previous headphones ( by sennheiser ) died , i purchased these to use for the cd instead
from an audio quality standpoint , with my old sennheiser headphones , i could hear some subtle nuances in the audio , at slightly lower volume , than i can with these headphones
then again , the sennheiser headphones cost $250 , while these cost $70
however , my sony headphones serve me very well
they produce good ( but not great ) sound , so i can clearly hear the bass and without turning up the volume
because the ear cups are soft and comfortable , the top is padded , and the headphones themselves are lightweight , i can easily fall sleep with the headphones on
the coiled cord is extremely handy , keeping the headphones from becoming too tangled
beyond that , the headphones themselves are sturdy , standing up to a year of being put in a squished suitcase without a scratch
also , they are very affordable ( about $70 from amazon
com )
the only issue is , if i wanted headphones to use while working out , these headphones wouldn not do because the padding would likely absorb my sweat
however , for my needs , these are excellent
although the audio isn not quite professional quality , these are an excellent set of headphones for the money .
i use these at work when i am busy and need to concentrate
i work in a cubicle with people who like to laugh and joke loudly
that is great , except when i have a deadline
i put these on and listen to a cd or the radio , and it shuts out the noise to the point where i can actually get some work done
i think the sound quality is great
the coiled cord is about <NUM> feet long or so and stretches out nicely
sony is page says the cord is 9
8 feet long , extended
it allows me to move about a small area in my cubicle without it getting tangled
they are the only headphones i have been able to wear all day long without hurting my head
i'd buy them again , especially at this price .
i used to think these are good but as i realized it was more a placebo thing because 1 ) i used to think sony makes the best electronics so it would naturally include headphones 2 ) i was ignorant in the world of headphones
do your research , sony is not even close to being in par with the best headphones manufacturers like sennheiser , grado , and akg
these brands are , in my opinion , the best in the business
after listening to jazz with my akg <NUM> and switching over to the sony , i feel like just throwing this piece of garbage on the wall like really hard
the sound coming from it sucks so bad in comparison with my akg
don not believe me ? read all the bad reviews in any review web site , not just this site , and you will hear the same thing : muddy
sony headphones sound muddy
i own <NUM> sony headphones and they all have the same characteristics : loud , muddy , and bassy
now <NUM> and <NUM> are not bad qualities , but <NUM> is just unacceptable for anyone looking for good sound
now these will for sure sound better than really cheap portable headphones or your ipod buds , but that doesn not necessarily mean they are any good .
i think these are great headphones
i have tried the sony ( bought a pair and gave them away
couldn not stand them ) , some expensive shure headphones ( i felt like my ears were going to bleed after wearing them ) , and some sony
in the end , the v600s work the best for me ( so far )
they have great sound reproduction , i can wear them for hours at a time ( and i am super sensitive
i could wear the v6s for about <NUM> hour a day before i had to take them off ) , and they are a great value
the plastics used in their construction seem to be good quality , and they are aesthetically pleasing ( not incredibly so , but they are certainly not ugly ) .
i asked an engineer that has done a ton of work w/ dj premier & w/ a ton of famous artists in rap & hiphop for a decently priced but still quality headphone back in 2010
he hit me back w/ a link to the for $83
99 so i bought them
now i see the price is over double that
i can definitely undertand why
they have a really great sound quality even at the <NUM> dollar price tag
the highs are crisp and the bass hits deep
i have used them soley for the past <NUM> years and wear them sometimes for up to <NUM> hours w/ very little discomfort & obviously taking breaks throughout
they are also extremely durable and made w/ heavy duty plastic , cordage & parts and can definitely take some hits and drops
the cord is also long enough to provided a great distance to move around and access other equipment around the studio
considering how much i paid for them they were definitely a steal , but regardless they are some headphones i will probably use for atleast <NUM> or <NUM> more years
i can certainly say these are some of the best headphones i have ever owned
overall comfort , durability & superb sound quality made these the perfect pair for me .
the headphone cup that goes around your ear is nice for the plane because it eliminates much of the ambient noise that causes lethargy , but if you want a better audio experience buy the sony mdr v700 headphones
they are a little less cuppy on your ear , but the sound is far superior .
these headphones are terrific
i use them all the time for listening to music and watching movies
i have had them for a few years now , and they still work just as good as the day i bought them
they have a nice long cord , so you don not have to sit close to your receiver or dvd player
if you are looking for a set of headphones , these are one of the best for its price range .
i bought the sony headphones about <NUM> seasons ago , and have loved them ever since
i bought them refurbished from amazon
com at the time , and paid $70 for them ( including shipping )
mind you , those were used , refurbished headphones , but they and their packaging looked like new and performed ( and still perform ) like new
i am baffled to see them being sold for $200 on amazon now , even though their traditionally more expensive and higher quality siblings ( the and mdr7506 ) are offered for $130 and $100 less , respectively
if you were planning to spend the stated $200 on the sony headphones , do yourself a favor and try the or mdr7506 instead
with that said , i love my v600s and have never regretted the purchase
the bass is subtle but still obviously present , while the highs can get painfully high when paired with my macbook pro ( 2012 model , which has a good dac in it )
this is reflected in the advertised frequency range of , 000 hz , and it surprised me since in my experience , sony headphones traditionally sound a bit heavy on the bass , and muffled
in comparison , these headphones produce super clear sound
best of all , the v600s are *comfortable* ! so much so that i can wear them for hours on end during study sessions and never get tired of wearing them
they work well with my old ipod video ( generation 5
5 , 30gb ) and different computers , which means the headphones don not use a lot of power
verdict : if you can find these headphones for $ , it is a deal you should never pass up
i thought they sounded better and more accurate than a friend is akg <NUM> ( which was admittedly more comfortable and durable , but still )
those looking to spend $200 on headphones and are interested in the should save themselves $100 and get the v6 or mdr7506 instead .
these are good headphones for the price
they deliver brilliant fidelity across the audio spectrum
i was really impressed by both the bass and treble reproduction and response and their ability to envelop my ears diminishing outside sounds
i use these with a yamaha receiver
they deliver very good sound with this receiver
the receiver can play a factor on how sound and music is reproduced through these headphones
that is something you should consider when choosing any headphones .
these are the official headphones for the holosync user
i have used them with some of the new audio sound that the higher levels of holosync use and they were amazing
the "knock" at the door and the "whisper" in one ear , on the demo cd , for the sound technology , i think it is called "audiophonics" made me jump thru the roof - the sound was so real ! i think these headphones are very comfortable - they have the adapters - both small and large - that come with them , you don not have to buy separate ones , and the cord is long , flexible and coiled
i thought amazon had a very decent price for them , i have seen them at 2x or 3x the price
no complaints at all - i really like them a lot .
comfy to wear , sound great , sturdy enough
wrap around the ears nicely to keep ambient noise at a minimum , keep the good smooth highs and round bass in
about the same as the v6s i had for <NUM> years , but more comfortable .
i purchased these three years and four months ago , they still sound as good as day one
all sound is crisp and clear
they are comfortable for many hours
i got them for sixty -six bucks
the ear foam has started to wear out and flake off so i bought replacements , for eight bucks
hope to get many more years service out of them .
i am pretty sure that i have had these headphones since 1992
i can not believe they still make the same model ( mine look exactly like the model pictured )
after fourteen years , the material covering the foam padding is starting to crack , but they still sound great .
i paid like $70 for these
i should have bought a few but i didn not know they price would jump so high
i paid less than half of what they are currently going for on amazon
they just happen to have a frequency response that my meditation cds require
so , i bought them for that purpose
they do a great job and they are also high quality headphones
what more could i ask for ?
i had this head phone for <NUM> years now i bought in <NUM> when i was single and had cash and was looking for best head phone i could buy
i got in <NUM> for $100 bucks thought was alot but has last for <NUM> years now and still sound as good as any head phone i have had
my kids have used them too now days , i see these dre beat and other head phones and see people go through them head phone and wonder what they do to them , you pay for head phone that cost that much you would expect them to last ! i went through whole decade with these , i saw headphone get smaller and smaller , now getting bigger and bigger
which is funny but i have had this pair and nothing go wrong with them , can wear all day without problem
i would highly recommend them to anyone looking for great sounding head phones that will last
i see the price has double since i bought them last , but will being another pair whenever these go out if they ever do !
i remember back in the summer of <NUM> i was in the muskegon , michigan best buy and saw these headphones i bought them after hearing other headphones that were more expensive but went ahead and bought these because they looked durable and i have been satisfied with sony is bookshelf speakers and figured that their headphones would sound even better
they were the first pair of v600s i have had
i thought the bass and vocals sounded really good but the treble was a little too thin and inaccurate in my opinion
they were still great headphones and i thought i couldn not find anything much better for the price or so it seemed back then
then a couple of months later i was on vacation in new york and accidently left these at a hotel and was disappointed that i lost these headphones
i went until january without decent headphones and then bought another pair of sony v600s in holland , michigan but when i opened them at home i was disappointed that they weren not really the same
the cord was too thin compared to my original pair that was heavy duty and thicker
i had them for about <NUM> years until i got a cat and she chewed the wire right apart
i was pretty ticked off and gave up on this particular model of headphone and decided to save my money for the professional sony mdr <NUM> which i reasearced on different sites that said were very durable and rugged headphones so i went ahead and bought those
i am a lot happier with the <NUM> not just for their durability and thick cord but i also thought and still think they sound twice as good as the v600s ( the treble sounds a lot better on the 7506s ) for about <NUM> to <NUM> $ more and are a better pair
i keep a better eye on my cat and she hasn not even messed with my cords anymore
the v600s are decent headphones but the thin cord makes it so i just can not recommend them to anyone who owns a pet or little kids .
i had to return these after one day because they were huge on the ears
there was no way to adjust the headband , so it kept falling off my head
i got irritated so i just returned it
sound quality was pretty good , but i didnt have them long enough to say anything else about this .
these are the best headphones u can buy
i got them , put them on on the way home and couldnt believe how amazing the sound is ! i have had nearly every headphone , been searching for the "perfect" headphone and i just found it ! they look really cool , use only a trickle of power for mp3 players , and give u great sound that covers youre ear unlike earbud or anything like that
with these you get very very clear distinguishable sound from headphones that are light as a penny
they are as comfortable as wearing a hat , and you bearly feel they r even on
it is definitely worth the [price] compared to [price] headphones that break in a week
and i get [price] a week so i value money alot ! buy these headphones ! they dont distort music , they just give it to you with awesome clarity and precision
they sound so much better than even my awesome sony speakers ! edit : i wrote this review many many years ago , and apologize for the awful grammar and spelling
i still own these headphones , and they still sound great , but after becoming somewhat of an audiophile , i have noticed that these emphasize treble and bass
they sound very punchy and clear because of this , so <PERCENT> of people will love them , however if you want to hear music without any extra bass or treble , you will have to get some more professional oriented headphones from sennheiser or the very well known sony models
the headphones are well made , but as with most headphones , the first thing to break down is the ear pads and head pad covering
after so many years of use , the pleather material has seperated from the inside of the ear cups and head band
this does not interfere with comfort at all , but they don not look as nice as they did when they were new
that said , the drivers still work great , and sound quality is what it always was
i lent these headphones to a friend who was a fan of rap and other music ( that i don not listen to ) and he refused to give them back for <NUM> weeks , since he liked them so much
if you don not mind getting headphones that are many many years old but still sound great for most ears , these are a great choice
please disregard my previous review , i was just happy to find headphones that sounded decent .
these are good , blocks off all sound so you stay focused , so when i am in grind mode in the studio i am in grind mode
only thing is , if listening on high volume in a tight place , like the car , everyone will hear what your listening to
just wish somehow it would stay within the headphones , and you .
i"m just an average guy who likes listening to music
i also use them for privacy when watching tv in a "full house"
i will let the audiophiles give the specs/high & lows/bass & treble reviews
i bought these to replace my is ( see my review of those )
yes i understand those were bluetooth and these are not
i really didn not care that they were "wire only"
these headphones are very comfortable
the giant earpads engulf your ears
the leather ( or what i am guessing is leather ) is very smooth
i am hoping for some durability there but i can not attest to it so early after purchase
they are big enough that i don not have to extend the ear pads at all
the headpiece is soft but solid
no worries there
i use mine at the desk so the cord is plenty long enough for me
i haven not had them on a plane so i can not say how they will do on blocking out noise but i am hopeful
i will update on that as it happens
one last common man observation , and maybe i missed it in amazon is description , the plug is a standard stereo sized plug but you can unscrew is and underneath is a 3
5mm plug
anyway really like them and for the price , you can not go wrong .
these headphones are almost indistinguishable from the sony <NUM> model , which may well be the most popular headphones in american recording studios
i have both
i think the v600s are lighter weight , so a little more comfy for long sessions , or wearing all day in an office or something
the cord attached to only one side is great
the phones &quot ; seal up&quot ; really well , with a true design
if you squeeze the cups shut together , you can just barely hear them , even if it is cranked up to bust your eardrums
this , in spite of the fact that they are plastic
you cannot hear the outside world when these phones are at normal levels
when they are cranked up , somebody could be shouting in your face , and you'd think they were
besides being , and loud , these phones give a big , smooth sound that won not give you a headache or have you wondering what you are missing
as another reviewer mentioned , they are very efficient , producing a ton of volume with very little power - and it is volume you can stand , unlike lesser models that will hurt your ears at similar decibel levels
if you are looking for the pro version - it is the 7506 , and only available at musical/recording outlets
here , all you have to do is click that button , and soon you will be listening to headphones that i'd buy again and again if i lost or destroyed them .
i ordered these after buying several ( supposedly decent ) pairs ( and returning them )
i love these
the sound is so clear - they sound great even turned up very loud ( they have the capability to go much louder than i could ever stand ) vocals are super clear , while the subtlety of the other instruments and little bell sounds and stuff on the tracks can be heard very well
nice bass also
i am like "the princess and the pea" when it comes to comfort , and these things are super comfortable ! i can hardly feel them
i wear glasses , and other headphones pressed my glasses against my head which hurts , these don not
i don not think they mention it in the product description , but they do cancel alot of ambient noise -- my phone just rang , and i totally did not hear it with these on my head
i highly recommend these .
i have been using these headphones for nearly eight years , and they still sound incredible
they catch the highest highs and lowest lows , and the construction is built to last
i use these for djing and i have hauled these headphones to countless clubs and gigs with nary a problem in all the years i have used them
i also have a pair at home that sound great no matter what you are plugging them into , be it a stereo , an ipod , or a television set
for the price , you simply cannot get a better pair of headphones for the price
buy with confidence !
i am not much of an audiophile , and i admit that i initially shuddered at the thought of dropping so much cash on a set of headphones
but then a friend of mine recommended these , said i wouldn not regret it
i am happy to say that he was right
watching movies and listening to music became an entirely different experience
brought out the best in my cds and dvds and the worst out of my mp3s
every little click and hiss became clear as day
found myself a bunch of my old stuff at higher bitrates , but it was worth it
best of all , they block quite a bit of outside noise
great for getting some peace and quiet in even the most chaotic of environments
and that is not all
they pack neatly--they fold and fit snugly in the included vinyl pouch , which is surprisingly durable
the headphones themselves have held up pretty well , but then i am pretty gentle with them
the cord is plenty long and doesn not tangle easily
these little touches make all the difference
if you have more discerning tastes , you may be better served by something else more refined ( and likely more expensive )
but if you are looking to move up from cheapo $10 headsets , this is as good a place as any to start .
sony headphones deliver great sound no matter if you plug it in a stereo or portable device
i love the crisp sound .
i have used a pair of headphones to critical mixes and do any and all other client audio work for ( i think ) over a decade
i have replaced the ear cushions once , which was surprisingly easy to do
i cannot imagine what reviewers are thinking of when they describe the sound as muddy -- these have served me well as a reference standard for all the work i do
i have tried several other pairs of cans and i keep coming back to these
i think i paid twice what you can find them for now , back in the day ( i seem to remember a $125 price tag ) , and seriously contemplate , every few months , shelving a second pair for safekeeping .
good "overall" headphones for the ( cost sold here ) and for first foray into a better sound from the standard issue
for the price they have a better than usual articulation in the sound but
i bought them at a mall ( $100 ) to get me through a "quick need" situation and i expected a little more from sony
i have had many other cheap & high end "cans" as well thus seeing both sides of the spectrum , for my money
price wise these sony mdr v600 is are pretty decent for someone wanting a quiet ( ) headphone for not too much money ( $80 or so )
like all "cans" they will sound better after you break them in about 30hrs
or so
i have used/tried these on both my desk/top computer ( taking out the speaker jack & plugging these in after unscrewing the 1/4" jack supplied ) & on my "high end" stereo system
pros : fit snuggly , adjust well , not too heavy ; they work well ( for large cans ) and loud on a fair/low amount of energy ; decent amount of "presence" and spacial deffiniton ; they have clear sound that won not show the immperfections of some recordings ; a nice touch , one cord feeds both ears/speakers on the left side ; design style folds up small for it is overall size
nice length/design to the cord
cons : a weak bass response that becomes muddled if pushed ( loud ) at all
mid range response is loud yet sounds "flat"
and highs that sound "clipped" and not really distinct
( these comments may be a little harsh for the price range but i am trying to steer you towards somthing better if you are willing to spend a little more ) anyone really wanting to dramatically improve their lisenting experience , and using/needing headphones on a regualr basis should spend a little more money and buy any sennheiser or a grado product
for the money , these are excellent headphone alternatives for whatever additional amount ( more than this ) your willing to pay
all in all , not a bad product solid good plastic construction in design , not a stand out ( in sound ) either
and for the money seemingly average
my advice is to spend a bit more and get somthing that you will really notice the difference in and say wow ! than you will have somthing that will last you for years to come .
i have been in the broadcasting business for over <NUM> years and these are the best headphones i have ever used
it took some convincing to invest in them , since i usually bought cheaper headphones
but the cheap ones last a few months , and the sony last years
you won not be sorry with this headphones !
i am an audio newbie and for me , these sound great
i know that one can always spend more money , but these worked just fine for me , but only for about four years
the side of the headphones just fell apart
one day , they were working fine , the next they break on me and become unusable , hanging by a single cord
i didn not use these every day , but only on occasion
i would have thought that they'd have lasted me years , but i was way off .
from the start had to fiddle with plug to get good sound
at first , i thought it was the computer jack , but as timewent on it got worse and worse
did some experimentingand determined it was definitely loose wiring in the plug
you spend this kind of money you at least expect it to bemanufactured well
i am done with sony
i have had other badexperiences recently , they just aren not what they used to be .
i have owned the v600 , the <NUM> and the v6 is
i have been happy with all three , though if i had to pick , i'd take the v6s
and i am fairly critical when it comes to headphones
anyone trying to divine perfection among these three really needs to go audition all of them to see which they prefer
they differ , but are comfortable , yield sound , and are
i wouldn not have a problem recommending any of them
the differentiators are these : the v6 and <NUM> are almost identical ( though the 7506s are more expensive ) , are flatter in response and more suited to studio use
the v600 is a headphone to general listening use with a sound that tends toward warmer and bassier
my current set of v600 is is getting pretty tired , and i will probably audition all three again myself
to anyone reading reviews to figure out which to buy , my advice is to not it - unless you already have a preference , buy whichever is the best deal at the time
chances are , you will be more than happy
sony makes superb headphones .
these are not the real deal
they are fakes
the so called 40mm diaphragm don not sound good at all
i have had a real pair of v600s , and they sound <PERCENT> better than these
do not waste your time or money on this product .
i have always gone the cheap route , and purchased $30 headsets that would last for a couple years and develop crackly sounds along the way
tiring of that in my middle age , i decided to spring for something a bit better , but first checked with amazon is reviews
this led me to the headset , which was about $80
should have done it a long time ago
money well spent ! excellent volume range , comfortable , covers my ears so well that it excludes all outside noise even at moderate output
i used them mostly for listening to itunes on my computer while i do other things
occasionally to practice piano/keyboard
like i said , money well spent , although i have only had them a couple months
other reviewers give high marks for longevity , so i expect they will be satisfying for me as well .
i use these for dj'ing , and have run them for several years
the only thing that i had happen , is the thin covering over the earphones , and also on the headband will deteriorate and come off in little pieces
i finally took some duct tape and used it like a lint roller to pull the remaining covering off because i would come home with little black pieces of material all over my head and clothes
since i use them in loud environments , i can not really comment on sound quality
they do block some sound ( a little less now that the covering came off ) , which helps in loud areas
the cord is coiled , and long , it has stretched out over time , so it is really long now , just make sure you don not wrap the cord around the phones tightly .
let me just preface this by stating that i am not an audiophile , so in terms of these headphones on a technical level , i can not say much
i can say , however , that i had decided about two years ago that i needed headphones for my computer , and so i went to j&r ; music and computer world to try ones on
i tried these , and they sounded great to me , again , being a , and they were extremely comfy
here it is , two years later , and the headphones still work fantastically , are still comfortable , and still sound great
they are not noise cancelling , however if you have loud music playing , odds are you won not be able to hear your roommate shouting at you from behind
in addition , since i can tell the difference between say , a 256kbps mp3 and a lossless version of the same song , i can still notice the same difference on these headphones
yes , this is a matter of audio compression , but the point i am trying to infer there is that even the small details of audio compression don not go unnoticed with these headphones
very highly recommended .
 , , , : i own all of these headphones , and i have to say that my <NUM> year old pair of sony is , and especially my newer is , blow these is out of the water
while arguably a bit more comfortable for long sessions , the is sound thin and cold compared to the is
i gave my is away because i was even more disappointed with them once i bought the is
kids , save your milk money for another week or two and buy some cans that are audiophile quality - the is
i have had mine for <NUM> years or so , and just recently replaced the with beyerdynamic velour pads and man oh man - the sound gets even better and the cans just got waaay more comfortable
buyer take note - do some reading on the "can" web sites and steer yourself towards a better sony product than the mediocre is
your ears will thank you , and you will thank amazon
com for getting the is to you in record time
( note : if you need something lighter and portable and it has to be sony , try the is - they sound decent , but they have had cord quality issues
i have been reading reviews where people talk about wearing out these phones and buying a second pair
i bought a new pair of ear pads from sony on line for less than $30 including s&h and tax
just as good as new !
headphones are highly personal devices , so don not be surprised to see wide variances of opinion
in fact , i have yet to discover an &quot ; &quot ; pair
imagine an equalizer board with slider switches adjustable in any number of configurations
boost the treble and upper while cutting back on the bass and you have the panasonic 850 is , which are perfect for concentrating on ella is voice or tony williams' ride cymbal but not on nelson riddle is orchestral arrangements or ray brown is bass
the sony is may be as close to a &quot ; universal , &quot ; accurate set of headphones as you can get for under a hundred and fifty
compared to my is , which my son &quot ; borrowed , &quot ; they are more comfortable and the sound is more &quot ; flat&quot ; ( i
accurate , faithful , undoctored )
if your tastes extend beyond contemporary pop and you are serious about sound &quot ; fidelity , &quot ; beware of those &quot ; dj&quot ; models , with the bass boost , and features
and as a previous reviewer has pointed out , this model is identical with the &quot ; professional&quot ; phones sony is listing as model 7506
perhaps sony plans to make the 700 is the only available models ( call it &quot ; marketing ) , because there are currently some great deals on the is
my only &quot ; complaint&quot ; is the extreme degree to which the v600 is seal off all outside sound , making me feel like i am trapped in a cocoon ( they are ideal for or solipsist personalities )
these phones are a pleasure now and then , but i am still happy with my sennheiser is for <PERCENT> of my listening .
i am a freelance camera operator and sometimes i end up having to edit projects
since i don not edit often i did not want to spend lots of money on studio headphones but at least wanted something that would cancel out the outside world when i edited and this does just that
i was so impressed i took it out in the field with me on sets and it is great
i can not hear anything unless someone talks into the microphone going to the camera which is great
i love these headphones .
the quality of sound on these things is amazing
good bass and amazing clarity
i am hearing things in my music i have never heard before !
i used a pair of sony v300 studio monitor headphones for about <NUM> years until they became unrepairable
i didn not realize that this was a blessing in disguise
i purchased the v600 headphones as a replacement since they addressed my greatest complaint with the v300s : ear compression
i use my headphones daily to listen to music while working in my cubicle
this amounts to at least <NUM> hours of use , <NUM> days a week , <NUM> weeks a year
that is at least <NUM> hours of use per year
i don not need my ears pressed up against my head by headphones
the v600s have a design that encloses all but the largest of ears
they are comfy and sound
i love these headphones !
best sony product i have purchased lately
my <NUM> year old has autism and we bought this for one of his cd sessions
it was recommended by the therapist group and they are very responsive with sound and fit my son just fine , drowning out distracting sounds around him while he is listening to his cds
i want to get a pair myself !
i first discovered these headphones by using the industrial version , the , for more than <NUM> years as a professional field video producer
i bought the is for home use , and they look and sound new after <NUM> years of occasional use at home
these are an headphone , meaning that they fit around the ears without touching them - they sit on your head but not on the ears , which means that your ears don not get sore
this also acoustically isolates you from your environment
however , if you sweat heavily , they also tend to trap moisture
sound reproduction is excellent and , and due to the acoustic isolation of the phones , you will hear well and you won not hear much of what is going on around you outside the phones
they do slightly emphasize bass in comparison to other frequencies , but that is something that most people don not mind
the 1/4" tip screws off to reveal a 1/8" stereo plug , so the phones work with most playback devices
i highly recommend them as durable , acoustically excellent workhorses that you will use for many years .
i have had these headphones for at least <NUM> years
they have been stepped on constantly , thrown around , used for countless gaming/music listening hours , and even had my dog chew on them for a bit
they still work fine
great sound quality , reliable , durable , and so comfortable you don not know they are on sometimes
<NUM> stars .
my wife and i have been using a meditation program for over a year ( holosync ) and these headphones are recommended by the company to use if you want to enhance the listening experience
we had good results using just earbuds and more advanced listening devices aren not necessary until you get to advanced levels of the program , but we decided we'd give them a try
they were also much cheaper from amazon than buying from centerpointe
they really have improved the listening experience
i have some slight hearing loss and these headphones allow me to hear a greater range of sound without having to turn the volume up too high
the headset is very lightweight and comfortable for the bulk of it
the cord is long and dangling and is really too much for an ipod ( which of course they are not really made for anyway ) , but it is easy to reign in when necessary
if you get them , keep in mind that the bigger connector plug can be unscrewed to reveal the more common mini plug
over all we give them two thumbs up !
there is so much personal taste involved when assessing headphones
there is always a tradeoff to be made in terms of what headphones have what strengths--but even at that , these headphones are pretty disappointing
these headphones have great depth ( boomy ) but in midranges they lack a lot of detail
the sound is full but very flat
crispness is really lacking
if you have heard some headphones , or are the sort of person that appreciates satellites and tweeters when listening to a conventional speaker setup , you likely will be profoundly disappointed with these headphones
on the plus side , they are very comfortable to wear
they also do a very good job of sealing the sound in , so people nearby won not hear your music if you are wearing these
so they are a very good choice for work if you can put up with the sound quality
worth serious consideration instead ( for a closed/isolating headphone w/dj functionality ) would be the sony --which are similar in construction but beat the v600 in every way , or the akg k81dj , which also produces far superior sound for the same money
those are not quite as comfortable as the sony is--but sure sound better .
i purchased this headphone last december 2007
i went through a number of headphones before getting this headphone
i have used koss headphones and sennheisser headphones
the cheaper $ earphones i bought would always break down on me
headband would snap or the quality was just getting very poor
i went to a local music store and decided to take a dive into more expensive headphones
i purchased these headphones without even listening to them
i asked the clerk to recommend a good affordable headphone and he handed me these
i bought them and had my mp3 player in hand to test these out
immediately when i tried these headphones on it was a world of difference
they feel extremely comfortable and lightweight
the sound is real crisp and clean
these headphones sound beautiful with almost any sort of music
the only thing this headphone lack would be stronger bass
everything else from mids to highs , it is very nice
i can wear these headphones for 6hrs straight before my ears start hurting
this headphone even comes with a cool leather carrying case .
i gave these headphones a five star rating because the sound is very clear
you get good separation and a feeling of spatial separation and distance
they work great
they are comfortable
it is just too bad i can not use them
i bought these because other reviewers extolled the virtues of these headphones for sealing out the noise of their busy offices
any headphone can drown out surrounding noise
be warned
these are not well sealed
the sony product manual packed with the headphones cautions customers not to disturb those close by
if you also got the impression that these "closed" headphones would allow you to listen privately you will be disappointed
i work in an office doing data entry
i like to listen to wild profane and controversial stuff and i don not want people listening in
these headphones would disturb my colleagues if i used them at work
you can hear them clear and loud even when pressed firmly together
nobody i work with wants to hear the sex pistols sing the good ship venus
so as good as the is are the little headphones that came with my player are better because i can crank them up and only i can hear them
too bad because these are so much more comfortable
also i should mention i got "refurbished" headphones
the screws that hold them together do not all match some are silver and some are black
then it probably goes without saying that they are made in china not japan .
my oldest son had this model for several years and my other son or his dog or some imaginary elf hadapparently ruined these beyond repair
and &<HASHTAG> ; never to be found again&<HASHTAG> ; according to the oldest son
to savebloodshed i hopped on amazon and found the exact model available and shipped home in a few days ! amazon &<HASHTAG> ; is&<HASHTAG> ; the place !
these are the best headphones i have ever owned
i recently purchased a replacement pair , as my original set died after <NUM> years of intensive use
they were repeatedly abused , shoved in and out of my bag and under seats on airplanes and generally not treated very well
they have stood the test of time and really performed well
i am a designer and i wear headphones all day long at work so comfort is imperative
while these headphones are large , they are extremely comfortable and block out my obnoxious coworkers
while the earpads will wear away in time as they did with my old set , the comfort and quality is not compromised
i have purchased these as gifts for fellow music lovers and twice now for myself
i couldn not recommend them enough .
ok for the price and i like the design and fit so i keep buying them , but they break down quickly
i have been through several .
in the last 15+ years , i tried a number of phone headsets by different manufacturers
this one was the best --- lightweight , adjustable metal headband ( not plastic ) , extremely comfortable , small unbreakable mic &<HASHTAG> ; wand&<HASHTAG> ; , easily accessible earpiece volume and mute control , and mic volume control , which is not common for headsets in this price range
i used the previous headset for years until i moved overseas
now i am back , i am delighted to have another one .
quality of headset is good
does not have standard 3
5 jack plug as adverstised
would suggest only as replacement for other plantronic product and not cross usage .
i ordered two different headsets from amazon so we can have one upstairs in my office and one downstairs where my other half works when he works from home
i just took this one out of the box and so far is working as it should .
it broke before <NUM> months of light use , however plantronics replaced it for just the cost of postage to return the broken unit after receiving the prompt replacement
just google "plantronics quick web service form" ( without the quotes ) and fill out the form .
i have been a telecommuter since november 2005 , so i am on headset most of the workday , all week long
if you don not need background noise cancellation , and you prefer with boom microphone to buds : - ) then this is a very good , reliable bet
a quick and easy mute switch / volume control is essential for conference calls , and this design is perfect for that
in november <NUM> amazon said this model was currently unavailable , so you might have to find the new model number .
this is the most comfortable headset i have had & really love it
it has volume & mute controls & i can wear it for long periods without any discomfort
the only reason it doesn not get <NUM> stars is , it just doesn not last long
i think it is in part that the cord gets yanked a bit here & there , catching on something as i move about , perhaps pulling connecting wires
i have tried other headsets that are not anywhere as good and don not last either
i just pay for this as i need it & accept it as the way it is .
i work from home and use my home phone at least <NUM> to <NUM> hours a day
i have panasonic and have used panasonic headsets previously
after i cycled through two of them , i decided to give this one a try
i just got it in the mail and it has 3
5 mm jack
my home phone takes 2
5mm jack
there is no information in the product description about the headset jack size so i relied on some of the reviews where people used it successfully for home phone
i also had someone comment that they also received a jack adapter 3
5 to 2
5 mm
i did not get that so this is useless for me
i will be contacting the vendor for a return
disappointing !
i have been using for daily for one week , with a 900mhz cordless home / office phone
when my old headset died , i actually tried a cheap $20 replacement headset
returned it , and decided to try the mythic plantronics name
pro : - excellent sound quality sending and receiving- all day comfort in headset mode
have actually forgotten to remove it a couple times already
- useful control features ( mute , receiving volume , and sending output volume ) - good industrial design ( i
cool looking + mike boom is not too long ) con : - concerns about durability
the cable thickness and lack of robust strain relief looks like a potential for sudden failure
considering this the top of the line , i would have expected better from plantronics
- value ( paid $45 locally )
cost more than the phone itself
if it lasts awhile , i expect to be a happy customer
for $30 on amazon , i see little downside , and probably no better product for the intended use .
i had a plantronics headset before , and they have definitely improved on what i already liked : great sound quality--most people say they can not tell i have any background noise even when i am in the car , and comfortable headset
i use the version of it so i can hear best , and they have added a mute button on the headset cord , as well as the volume control
a great value for the money , and hard to improve on for any price .
the sound quality is the best of any home headset i have ever used
i bought another brand at a radioshack and it sounded horrible
but the manufacturing quality is bad
it only lasted for a year before it broke and i had to buy a new one ( i guess that is how plantronics makes extra profits ) .
this purchase was for a backup of one i had bought previously that has worked very well
after reading other reviews where people had stated that it only lasted months before breaking i bought another one for back up
i have found it to be very comfortable and have used it several times for hour conversations
i have put my phone in my shirt pocket and roamed the house while talking with no loss of clarity
i may have to buy another one as my wife is thinking of using the backup
i don not think the unit is that fragile , but some people are hard on things
i don not know if i would recommend it for continuous all day use , but if handled with reasonable care it seems it should last a lot longer then <NUM> months .
product arrived in time and worked successfully
it came with no documentation , although it was fairly easy to figure out .
there seems to be some conflicting information about using this headset with the iphone among the existing reviews
for the record , the jack on this headset is not the right size for use with the iphone 4 .
finally , i have found a headset with a 2
5mm plug which actually works and with which the folks on the other end of the phone can hear me
i bought this for my corded office phone , not a mobile or cordless phone , and it works great
i really wanted a headset with the 2
5mm plug , and this is the only one i have found which works well enough for me and has adjustable mic input
not sure about durability yet
quality seems okay , cord does seem somewhat thin .
i have used this very model headset for many years and yes after several years they do wear out as do many things but when i had to replace the one i had i found it here at amazon
com and not only were they new but they were the least expensive i could find anywhere
some site were asking as much as <NUM> times what i paid here
thanks once again amazon
i have had this model for years
i am happy to keep buying them when they wear out because the sound quality is good and the mute button on the cord is a lifesaver when office interruptions happen in the middle of a phone call
i have used this model for over <NUM> years with a radio shack headset amplifier and the nortel and polycom phone systems
love it .
it is nice that it gives the option to use either over the head or over the ear
the padded speaker cover is comfortable and will not wear out like the foam kind
i used the switch to turn the the mic on and off a lot and has made it much more useful to me .
this is the third time i have ordered a plantronics product
i had to return two of them
ist set of earhones just didn not work and the latest was the plantronics /ear headset , m175c
out of the box the headset had a loose connection
the slightest movement caused it to cut out
returned the product to the seller .
after trying dozens of headsets for my phone i was a little hesitant to try another one , but i have heard good things about the plantronics brand so i thought i'd give this a try
most of the headsets i have used suffered from poor reception or poor design ( or both )
i was both pleased and surprised that the m175c excels in looks and function
calls received were crisp and clear with no static or noise of any kind
the headset can be used over the head or folded to place behind the ear
it comes with a nice cushy ear piece if you decide to use it over your head , which i did
the volume control on the cord has a clip above it so you can attach it to your shirt or pocket and easily adjust the sound with the small thumb wheel
this works remarkably well and i find myself using it more than the volume control switch that is on my phone
because the headset is so light even after wearing it for a couple hours i can hardly tell i have it on
it is so nice to finally be able to move around , make a cup of coffee , wave my hands in the air , or whatever
i highly recommend the m175c to anyone who wants a decent headset for their phone .
this headset is my favorite
i have used them for years and they wear out from use , which is to be expected
i hope they keep producing it
if the headband is too tight for you , just bend it a little
it also comes with an ear loop
great incoming and outgoing volume controls .
for the price , you can not beat this little headset
the mute switch sets it apart from other headsets , which is a feature for conference calls
it is also comfortable , and in my expererience , fairly durable
i have used this headset for <NUM> years with no complaints
in fact , i am listening to a conference call on it right now
: - )
i find these headsets perfect for use on my home telephone
it allows me to make phone calls while i am doing other things , whether it is doing dishes , or typing on the computer
the party on the other side never knows i am using a headset , as the voice quality is perfect .
my only hesitation about buying this product was that , while the bluetooth and other wired devices keep getting smaller and sleeker , this one looks like something from <NUM> years ago
nonetheless , i recommend it and would buy it again because it gives the best sound quality of the devices i have tried , it is very comfortable ( i don not like ear pieces that hang onto my ear for support ) , and it has volume and mute controls at a decent price
when you find a good price , i recommend buying several so you can keep one in each car , one by each indoor phone ( i use it more for indoors than with my cell phone in the car ) , and because they will eventually break .
i paid a little more for these than another pair , thinking the plantronics brand and the boom would enhance sound quality for those i talk to
actually , i have been told the sound of my voice is slightly less clear than the piece i had been using at half the price
so would not recommend .
this headset is worth every extra penny
i have used this model and its siblings for <NUM> years and attest to the quality and value of plantronics equiptment
i have bought three of their phones ( 2 as gifts ) and have never had a problem
when one of their products eventually wore down from high use , they replaced it promptly with no hassle
they make most of the call center equiptment in the world and it shows
this is a great product made by a great company .
i have had this gadget for a while now
it was well thought out and it works well
i am completely pleased
i made my decision based on the comments by amazon reviewers
thanks for the good advice , people !
the headset fits the standard 2
5mm jack found on many cordless phones
the fit is comfortable and the sound is fine , both incoming and outgoing
however , mine broke just shy of two months after i bought it .
i enjoy this headset
i have tried and earbud units , but this is by far the most secure and comfortable style
the volume control is easy to use and it has handy mute on/off switch
no more finding the mute button and adjusting the volume on my treo <NUM> anymore ( pretty dangerous while driving )
my only complaint is the volume is a little low if you are talking to a person
but it is tough anyway to listen to him/her without the headset , plus you can detach the cushion on the earpiece so the receiver is a little closer to your ear .
i have hearing aids so i needed one that just laid on the ear
this works fine even with my ipad .
i was a bit wary about buying this headset in used condition , but was lured by the price tag when compared to a new headset
i envisioned all sorts of shortcomings , but when it arrived i was astounded at the excellent condition of the headset
it is clean
no scratches
no faded labeling
it looked to be brand new
oh yeah
it works great , too
&<HASHTAG> ;
now that i have used it for sometime now i can say that it holds up to what i put it through so i would recommend it to my friends and the time it took to get was right on time and now i just put my headset on instead of having to hold the phone up to my ear so i can have more of the long conversations
this is a great product
i was able to purchase it from amazon for only $25
00 , and definitely got my money is worth
i like this model because it has volume controls for both your voice output , and your hearing input
i use it as a headset , and the only complaint i have is that the speaker has a lot of bass
there are not any highs in the voice you hear , so your friend is voice always sounds emotionless and flat
i guess it is this way to protect your hearing
the sound is quite clear , just a limited frequency response .
i am in a job that requires me to be on the phone all the time
i have been using this same exact brand of plantronics headset for years
it lasts about years , but that seems about the norm with all the headsets i have had , or have heard about from others
i like that there is a mute option on the wire and it is very comfortable .
i have had this product for about a year and half
i have had no problems at all
people can hear clearly on the other end , the mute switch doesn not make any noise , volume control seems adequate
it is been very durable too , i have dropped it on the floor a bunch of times and it has been unaffected
most importantly , the sound reproduction quality is excellent
other headsets i have used in the past have degraded the sound quality noticably .
this is a great unit
i have had it about <NUM> weeks now
i use it with my ge 5
8 ghz cordless home phone and it works fine
i work from home days a week and attend or host conference calls about times a day
my coworkers tell me i sound loud and clear
the set is comfortable ; lightweight but not flimsy or fragile ; with padded ear piece
i especially like the mute switch/volume control on the cord
the cord is long enough to give me plenty of slack with the phone clipped to my waist band and i am 6'3" so that is important
i would highly recommend this unit .
made it to the junk tech drawer
not worth the cost of return
not really the worth of completing the minimum word number for the review
generally i don not pan a product but tested this on two phones
keep looking .
my biggest problem is the so keeps borrowing this when she takes conference calls at home
ok - second problem
now i have a usb headset for skype/etc , and a wired headset for cell phones and when traveling ( i usually don not bring the usb headset - too fragile )
so now my nest of wires has gotten a little worse
generally i don not like the quality/reliability of bluetooth , but i may try again in the next few months .
i replaced <NUM> of these and then finally bought a dect <NUM> phone system and a dedicated all in one vs a cord like this
cord and connection is a weak spot .
i love that this headset stays firmly on the head with the band and firmly on the ear with just the ear piece
the sound quality is great , and the ability to mute the mic is the main reason i bought this
the mute switch is in a convenient place and has a nice clip to attach to your shirt
the only reason i give this <NUM> stars instead of <NUM> is because i have had a lot of people tell me i sound somewhat distorted when talking on it
usually i can make it better by adjusting the mic volume ( another nice feature ) or by moving the mic away from my mouth
overall good purchase for the money .
i bought this headset to use with my cordless phone system which i use with skype
i have a bluetooth headset on my left ear , and i keep this one on my right so i can answer my cell phone and the regular phone simultaneously while i am working on my computer
i use only motorola cell phones and bluetooth units , and previous cordless phone headsets left a lot to be desired
the plantronics unit is wondeful ; it is light enough that i forget it is there , and even me can hear it well
the adjustable hearing is great , as is the adjustable volume on the microphone
i heartily recommend it .
works fine , we have bought multiple models of plantronics headsets and due to rough duty in my wife is purse , they all eventually fall apart
but while they survive they work great
have tried ear buds , ear canal , blue tooth etc , but keep coming back to this style plantronics for overall functionality .
i purchased this headset for use when on the cell phone
the sound quality and way it fits is excellent
the headband could be a bit sturdier but i am careful when expanding or shortening it so i think it is fine .
i have been using one of these for years ! i replace it with a new one when the old one wears out
the mic is always strong enough to pick up my voice , and i never have complaints about people not being able to hear me
the is comfy , and i occasionally forget i have this on
the best part is the adjustable amplifier - if i have distortion from the sound out of my cell phone , i can increase or decrease both the output from the cell phone itself and the amplifier on the headset , and i usually can maximize the sound and minimize distortion
i don not have to hold anything with my hand to get the conversation through .
love this type of headset
i use one at work every day , so i got one for home too
i hate things &<HASHTAG> ; in&<HASHTAG> ; my ear , so this quality type keeps everything where it belongs and i can wear it for hours with no pain or irritation
comfortable and lightweight
doesn not even mess up hair
it includes a leatherette &<HASHTAG> ; cup&<HASHTAG> ; for the ear speaker , but i usually don not even use it , finding it comfortable even without it
it converts to an &<HASHTAG> ; ear hook&<HASHTAG> ; type also , but i don not find that very useful
the inline volume control and mute is nice , although a bit large and heavy
great sound quality
this headset works great ! i have been using it for several weeks now and the sound is clear and the fit is comfortable
i spend several hours a day on the phone , so comfort was a biggie for me .
convenient and easy to use - allows you to carry on a conversation and still listen in on conference calls .
very good headset
the first one was damage due to improper use
but this is a headset that we use everyday for work
<NUM> hours per day on average
not perfect but very good and excellent range .
i bought this headset to plug into myphilips voip841 dect 6
0 wireless ip phoneandphilips voip <NUM> skype dual phone single handset ( voip3211g/37 ) to let me call into teleconferences whilst still having my hands free to type
pros : - compatibility : worked without issues with both my cordless phones
- features : the headset allows adjustment of earpiece and microphone volumes which allows the headset to be tweaked to work optimally for the phone and user
also , having a mute switch on the cable control module is very useful
- audio quality : incoming voices come in loud and clear and i have never had any complaints about my voice being unclear
- comfort : i wear this for at least an hour at a time and have never felt uncomfortable wearing it
there is the usual adjustable headband , the microphone boom can be moved and the earpiece can be worn on either ear
cons : - a version with two earpieces rather than just one would have been preferable .
this headset works fine , but i expected somewhat better sound quality for the price
also have not been able to get it to work with my samsung galaxy , i am guess that was an issue with the 2
5 to 3
5 mm plug adapter i got since it works fine with my panasonic cordless phone
not sure if this would allow you to initiate a call on the cell phone , however , which is what i am really looking for from a headset since bluetooth headset sound quality is so poor .
bottom line , plantronics makes the best headsets
i have been very happy with this one
people say they can hear me very clearly , and it is very comfortable to wear on long conference calls
if it breaks in the future i am sure i will buy another plantronics headset ( this model or a comparable one ) .
i use a headset every day
the first one stopped working within a month , got it replaced ( i have to pay for the return shipping ) and the second one stopped working in a week ( still have to put a warranty claim in )
decided to spend a few extra dollars and purchased the plantronics hw261n binaural headset with the plantronics 18straight cable - quick disconnect to 2
5 mm plug ,
someone told me that plantronics was cheap but i beg to disagree ! yes ; the price was quite reasonable but the quality sound is great .
i bought this for its durability , but the sound quality was pretty low/poor ; volume was low too .
works exactly as advertised
great for conf calls at home to keep hands free
mute button works great
use it on my home cordless phone and my blackberry with no problems .
i spent many hours searching for a good headset for my clarity xlc 3
4 cordless phone for the hearing impaired and settled on this one as the most bang for the buck
i was hoping for a headset to improve my hearing even with this phone , which it did , but only marginally so
it is convenient not to hold the phone to speak into it
the best about this headset is its very low price of $17
48 through the oem shop
for that low price , what can one really expect
( i did note many similar offerings for this headset from other suppliers ranging to several times what i paid )
at any rate , the image depicts two ear hooks ; i received only one size which seems too large to be useful
i received with the package a short adapter cable to convert the headset is connector from 3
5 mm to the necessary 2
5mm for my phone
the assembly is a bit clumsy when connected to my phone
the ear cushion is rather small ( the image shows two )
the entire headset construction is a bit fragile , and i don not expect it to last very long , so treat the unit with kid gloves
no instructions were supplied to convert to the ear hook , and i hesitate to try to adapt fearing to break the plastics .
i had bought several of the variety headsets and was getting pretty frustrated with their quality , lack of mute feature , etc , so finally i decided to spend some real money
i have a plantronics headset at work that is decent , so i bought this one
it is even better than my headset at work ! it is convertible from headset to earpiece ( for those who like that sort of thing
the little padded thingy for the earpiece ( when used in headset configuration ) is very comfortable
i don not notice any discomfort even after hours of usage
there is a mute switch on the wire , and both the earpiece and microphone volumes are adjustable
i have only had mine for a month or so , so i can not comment on the durability issues yet
apparently , i am not as acrobatic as some reviewers , so i don not expect problems
i really can not think of anything that i do not like about this piece of equipment .
this is a decent quality headset and sound quality from the ear piece is standard plantronics quality ( i
very good )
the 2
5mm jack means it won not fit on some mobile phones ( this is smaller than a standard headphone jack ) , but for my blackberry it is great ( both <NUM> and pearl )
as a bonus , i also use it with my xbox <NUM> controllers ( both with the attached messenger keyboard and without ) for online gaming
some people have observed that i sound a little distant with this headset while plugged into the wireless xbox controller , but repositioning the mic to be as close to my mouth as possible fixes it
there is an adjustable mic sensitivity switch on the plug , but this doesn not seem to make any difference to people at the far end of the conversation
it is held up quite well over the past few years , being stuffed in bags and traveling around
it is not as cool as the wireless headsets ( bluetooth etc ) but it doesn not take batteries , doesn not have to be recharged and isn not subject to interference
i will buy it again if/when this one finally dies .
plantronics is always a dependable brand and the quality of sound both incoming and outgoing is just as i expected .
awkward to use and the pieces were difficult to put together ( the padded ear cushion would not go on
and no instructions were provided )
uncomfortable on my head and basically more trouble than it was worth
will keep trying to find a good &<HASHTAG> ; &<HASHTAG> ; headset for my iphone as an alternate to bluetooth
my biggest problem was that it wasn not clear from the description that i had to also order the 2
5 - 3
5 adapter in order for the plug to work with my iphone 4
went all over trying to find such an item to no avail ( even best buy didn not carry anything )
trying to return it .
by trying to be all things to all people , this headset is a compromise
if you just want something to wear over your head you will find plantronics m214c to be better , and half the price
get that instead
( just to be clear , i do own both this and the m214c ) .
i got a panasonic and this plantronics m175c
the plantronics m175c is definitely better
it is more comfortable , and the microphone is more sensitive and has better sound quality
excited about this based on good reviews , but did not have the same experience
tested on my nexus s cell phone , person on the other end complained about static and poor quality sound
i unplugged headset and switched to using my cell , and they said the problem went away , so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset
also , just fyi , this does not come retail packaged , but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions
not a problem for me , but makes me wonder where these are from and the quality .
i had been looking for a good headset to use with my cordless phone at home
i have tried many headsets and none worked well enough for the people on the other end of the call to hear me
with this headset i can hear everyone clearly and they can hear me clearly
the price was great as well , under $20 .
i love plantronics headsets
the one i use for skype and for my computer has worked flawlessly for over <NUM> years
the one that my boyfriend uses for his cell phone has worked flawlessly for the past three years on a daily basis
when i needed a headset for my samsung brightsides , and other cheaper brands were failing me , i decided to shell out money for the plantronics mobile convertible headest
the sound quality on this headset is clear without any fuzziness or distraction
however , and this is a huge however , even on the highest volume setting on both the phone and the headset , the person on the other end of the phone has a very , very quiet voice
you are constantly having to ask them to repeat what they said , and for me , that is a problem
i tried fooling with the settings
i have had everything from ear buds to headsets with the brightside and the plantronics convertible headset has the lowest sound of any of them
the convertible feature is nice
you can use it as an over the ear headset or a headband style headset
i was not interested in the over the ear headset offering , so i immediately made it into a headband style headset
the little &<HASHTAG> ; ball&<HASHTAG> ; that the headband attachment seats into is not very sturdy and the constant swivel makes it easy to break if you aren not careful
i do like the swivel motion , so that you can adjust the ear cushion to fit comfortably on your ear
one note about the headset in headband mode , even though the height adjusts , it doesn not adjust far , either that or i have a really tall head , because i couldn not get it to adjust high enough to fit comfortably near my ear , it was always slightly above
another complaint about the headset is the side that does not have the cushion is a very weird shape with grooves , and i have long hair , every time i removed the headset , it would get caught in my hair
i put a spare headphone cushion over it , but there was nothing to keep it in place
i would literally have to yank my hair , or cut my hair around the headset to remove it from my head
this is while sitting in one place , with the headset placed on carefully and not adjusting it all day
i tried both with my hair down and with my hair in a pony tail and both ways the headset would get caught in my hair
this headset really defeats the hands free portion of a cell phone headset
you cannot answer a call without touching the answer button on your phone
if you are driving , or multi tasking , this can be a pain
i have a samsung brightside and i was having difficulties hanging up after a call , i would hit the end button , nothing would happen
i would hit the unlock button and then the end button , and nothing would happen
it was so frustrating
i eventually would have to remove the battery from the phone after every call and put it back in to end the call , not a whole lot of fun
this could have been eliminated had plantronics added a simple hang up/answer button to this headset
i know it is not a difficult thing to add , because every headset and ear bud set i have ever owned has one , even ones that cost a third of the price
i had a lot of problems using these headsets with the samsung brightside , the sound would cut in and out and make it difficult to hear , the sound would have an echo to it , etc
i know the samsung brightside isn not a great phone , but i have had cheaper headsets with better quality with the brightside then this headset produced
i did not try the over the ear mode , as i am not comfortable with that kind of attachment on my ear
maybe if i wasn not dead stuck on a headset that goes over the head , headband style , i would have had more luck with this headset , but i doubt it
after three days of using one , the microphone snapped off
i decided to return both , while i could , to verizon , and ask for a complete refund because this is definitely not what i thought i was purchasing .
i purchased this headset because my old plantronics headset fell apart
i do like this headset but i have been told that people can sometimes barely hear me when i am talking , so i have to move the mouth piece a little closer which sometimes causes my ear piece to move away from my ear
overall i am please with this purchase .
good sound quality
good price
convenient mute , mic and earpiece volume controls
will get uncomfortable for users
imo better than similar panasonic ( with the silly foam covered boom mic ) .
they fit , they are not tiresome , the sound is clear
all of the features work flawlessly
people are very satisfied when i am on them , there is no strange sound to my calls
it comes with the short cable i need to use with my panasonic handsets
it is light weight and having the controls on the line make it perfect for my use
if i needed another set for another location in my home , i would buy the same product again .
these have great sound and my voice is clear to other parties
the volume switch and mute slider work well and it has lasted for some time .
i have had no trouble at all with this headset
by the way , i recently bought a panasonic headset and it is almost exactly the same , but a few bucks cheaper
the difference is that the panasonic does not have a microphone gain adjustment switch .
not many sources to buy floppies these days , got it to copy dos software for old application on virtual machine
the labels included are of very low quality , won not stick , and got caught in the reader , had to be removed with a tweezer
otherwise , it is what it is--3 1/2 floppies .
with so few sources remaining for ibm formatted floppy disks , i was relieved to find them available on amazon
with old computers still in use , and with sony mavica floppy disk cameras still in circulation , the demand for fresh , new disks , however rapidly dwindling it might be , is definitely still there
the quality may have slipped a bit over the years , since of the many boxes i purchased , each had one or two defective disks that would not read or write , regardless of the efforts to reformat them
even so , it was still a bargain .
they work just fine , i forgot how slow and noisy these are ! packaged well and shipped fast , not really much more to say about them .
the floppies work just fine for storing data with vintage music gear like the yamaha ex5 or akai samplers
the only negative is that sony is kind of stingy with the labels - they are only half size
considering the price of smartmedia cards these days , i am tempted to buy a few boxes both for my own future use and as an investment
there is a lot of music gear that relies on floppy disks
workstations , samplers , grooveboxes/sequencers , etc .
good product
the floppy disks worked fine as advertised
fyi , i bought an external usb floppy drive to write these disks in the modern pcs ( mostly for reprogramming bios on old motherboards ) .
i bought a pair of headphones from another company for
way more money
i stumbled on these as i didn not want to leave such expensive headphones in my desk at work
turns out , i never should have bought the more expensive pair
i am sure there are better ones on the market , but for my ears these are more than enough .
i order these headphones in may <NUM> and i have been using these since on average about 6hrs/day up until about august , and have been using them on and off since
these are great headphones ! they produce quality sound , provide great comfort ( even for giant dumbo ears like mine ) , and they are super sturdy
there are my first pair of headphones of this quality so i don not really have anything to compare to other than beats ear buds , but these are two very different products
in all , these outperform the beats earbuds in every aspect except for portability , comfort , and sound cancelling ability
these headphones will take some time to get use to if you are not used to wearing bulky headphones ; they weight about a pound or so
with the weight , the band tends to sit on the top of head , regardless of how i adjust it , and it caused a little pain initially but it is no longer a problem because i have gotten used to it
the headphones are completely over the ears , so that took some time to get used to as well because that can also cause a little pain initially as well ; i have also gotten used to this
one other problem is the adapter , the 3
5mm adapter is massive and sticks out of my computer like
5" so it is nearly impossible to use it with the computer at an incline ( ie : on a laptop chill pad , or even watching it on your lap )
even with this all said it is still the best pair of headphones i have owned and it seems like it will continue providing quality sound for many years to come .
got these to monitor my new sony nx70u video camera
like everyone says , they don not color the sound which is important when monitoring the sound from the camera
you don not want any unnatural enhancement that isn not really there
about the tightness , for me they are perfect
they are not tight at all
i have an average size head for a 6'1&<HASHTAG> ; 250lb guy
the cord is long too and it has a tight spring to it so that if you walk away from the camera forgetting that these are on your head you wont pull the camera off the tripod .
idk it the faults i find are just because its supposed to be a certain way but these headphones dont make me bob my head and feel the music when im listening to it
buts its probably because it doesnt have that warmth a lot of people mention about
it picks up every single freakin detail though like the reverb from tupac is song ( who do u believe in ) i have never heard such clarity like that in any headphones ive had , even from the koss portapro , which are also freakin amazing
the bass in this isnt outstanding either but its probably intended to be like that so all of the things i knock it off for is probably because they are not intented to be that way
so in conclusion , these head phones , to me arent really my option to listen to tunes but are mainly for recording , which is why i bought them
so =doh yeah and its a bit sensitive in my headphone jack on my macbook pro , a little staticy sound , very very faint , is noticeable when u move the jack .
after not many hours of use , the entire ear pad on one side became detached from the plastic base plate
the synthetic leather covering was either press fitted or glued over the edge of this plastic part
it looked like i probably could have stretched the thing back over the plastic lip , although it would have taken some time
but because it would certainly have happened again with normal use anyway , i ended up throwing the whole thing away
what a waste
overall , a very poor design in my view .
perhaps my ears have been sullied by 'augmented' headphones in the past , but these particularly 'phones feel flatter and more lifeless than any others
i am not talking about a lack of thumping bass
that is fine by me
but rather
well , it is hard to describe
no warmth
no resonance
just sterile
i suppose this'd be fine or perhaps even desireable for studio monitor work , but when i am trying to enjoy folk tunes , classic jazz , orchestral music
it is just disheartening .
best headphones i have ever had
these are also the most expensive headphones i ever purchased
so , i can not really compare them to more expensive brands
i find that it is much easier to distinguish between different instruments and musical notes with these headphones as they provide much less blurring together of sound that other cheaper headphones i have owned
the only problem i had was that the headband started to cause the top of my head to hurt after about 1/2hr to and hour
- to fix this i just cut out a piece of memory foam from my beds mattress cover and used rubber bands to strap it to the headband
it looks ridiculous but works great .
just love them
they are loud , a lot
sound crispy and the bass is great
i use them for my desktop and the long cord let me move free
i recomend these a lot
ps : they get a little warm on your ears
update : after using them for one year , i have to say that all my other headphones sucks : p
the sound of these v6 are way wayyyyy better than any other i ever had
watching movies with dts and my v6 it is just awsome
i am very glad i got them .
i purchased this pair of headphone around four years ago
i used it from time to time - much less lately
at the very beginning , i first ran it for at least a hundred hours - leaving it plug to a cd player or pc and keep playing a few different kinds of music
i found the headphone reproducing high frequencies and low frequencies quite good
however , it lacks ; resulting that the music reproduced felt a bit &<HASHTAG> ; thin&<HASHTAG> ; and not warm enough ( but not harsh )
i mostly listen to classical music , easy listening , jazzy , vocal , instrumental , etc
, but no hard rock
also , it is not comfortable for wearing long times -- more than <NUM> mins -- you will feel too warm to your ears ; also the headphone is a bit heavy .
as the title of my review implies , i am a former ""
was not necessarily a "" since i have been buying their earbuds for years
however , although i have heard sony headphones previously , purchasing the v6 was still a chore since i had never actually bought a pair
preferring the koss and over the sony offerings
however , koos has ceased those models and have adopted lesser engineering
thus , sony was a breath of fresh air
i have allowed these headphones to fully break in before using them for any recordings
i recorded with them yesterday
damn ! wow
damn and wow again
the quality of the sound--the true full range of the sound--was stunning
almost made me forget what i was recording
excellent pair of headphones ! at this point , i want to purchase another pair , but i will wait until i have a surplus of funds since it seems the price keeps going up on them
if you are "on the fence"
stop playing
get these ! if you are not using these for recording , or not going to use these on a more amplified source ( such as a home receiver or headphone amplifier of some sort ) don not fret
i have listened to these on my mytouch with sufficient sound and quality sound reproduction
so , i am sure your ipod will do fine
: - ) enjoy !
i bought these after a lot of research and i am glad that i did , one of my actually got the more expensive mdr <NUM> and we ended up doing a side by side sound test
we played some flac files through vlc using the focusrite usb 2i2 dac and though they both sound good on their own , you can clearly tell that the <NUM> is coloring the sound significantly
also , the bass response on these seems to be better as well
some people have complained about the comfort of these and i have worn them for hours on end while working and have found them to be incredibly comfortable
i might enjoy the new ear pads because they supposedly help improve the sound quality , if/when i do i will update this to see if the combination is worth the hassle/money
all in all amazing headphones especially considering the price , you cannot go wrong with these .
my husband loves listening to music when he goes to bed , and i hate it
he suggested i get these for him so that he can listen and i can sleep in peace
i think i love them more than he does ! he used to use just ear buds and i could hear what he was listening to plain as day
i can not hear anything when he is using these headphones
he says that the sound with these are fantastic , like you are in a home theater
we both think they are worth the money .
i am taking a digital music course this semester , and so the class requires a pair of headphones in lieu of a textbook
being a perpetually poor audiophile who then had an excuse to buy nice headphones on somebody else is dime , i settled down to research
after hours and hours of looking and reading ratings and trying on different styles in the stores , i finally settled on the sony , having been warned away from the newer sony model that was supposed to replace them
obviously the ear cups haven not died yet , but i know they will in a few years , and i don not mind at all
i just got them in earlier this afternoon , and i haven not taken them off since without it being absolutely necessary
i have been listening to music for hours now
the biggest fear i had with buying new headphones was that they wouldn not be able to reproduce both sharp highs and smooth lows with clarity and without sibilance
after about an hour of listening to emilie autumn is electric violin , which has both in abundance , i have to say that my fears were laid to rest
i then moved on to the rest of my music library , and so far - with only a few hours of - it all sounds amazing
metal , rock , classical , reggaeton , electric , jazz , trance , everything
there is a touch of bass that i can not usually hear , and i am not sure if that is enhancement from the phones or just because i can actually hear better now , but i like it
all in all , one of the best i have ever bought , and i see myself loving these way after this class is over .
i can not stand those tinny earbuds
i bought the best ones i could find for my droid 2 , and they seemed ok , for awhile
then i purchased the fiio d11 and paired it with these headphones
what can i say
it is awesome
the fiio on low gain , with eq set to zero , my droid volume as loud as it would go , makes these headphones loud
really loud
at high gain , they are too loud
but even then , there is no distortion
the sound is crisp and clear
drums sound like you are standing in front of the drummer
it is like you are on stage
just like the other reviews say , you can hear things in the music that you don not even notice using the headphones mortals use
it comes with a nice carrying bag
the bag has a drawstring
it is a nice , leather or faux leather bag , but with the drawstring i can not put the extras in without worrying about them falling out in the wrong place
but i didn not expect the bag , so who cares ? the phones fold up easily , and quickly , and won not take up much space
these phones are really comfortable
i was worried that they would sit on my ears , but my ears fit nicely inside the cups
and it is easy to adjust them for a perfect fit
i have a trip coming up in a few weeks , and i am looking forward to putting these on and rediscovering my music collection
i wish i was leaving right now ! i highly recommend you get both items in this review , if you have a droid and want quality sound
without the fiio , these phones are probably loud enough for most people
even on an airplane
they sound as loud to me as my tinny headphones did , but without sounding crappy
like i am sitting in my living room listening to a quality stereo .
head pad part can be folded easily and save lots of room
and it came with extra adapter for big hole
so my daughter can use it for her digital piano and listening music from regular mp3 player
i don not remember how long i have owned these headphones but it has to be close to <NUM> years
( the only maintenance i have done is replace the foam earpads ) i have treated them with care and kept them from any type of abuse
they still look almost new and still sound exceptional
more recently i bought a pair of sennheiser hd590 phones thinking that perhaps i would get even better quality sound
indeed , the 590 is sound very good but frankly , though they sound slightly different than the v6 is , i don not think they sound any better
the v6 is have a presence and clarity which is very compelling
they can thunder the bass if need be and sail through through the high treble effortlessly
the are clear and mellow
distortion is inaudible
if you are wanting to step up to audiophile quality headphones for a very reasonable amount of money i recommend the sony headphones .
the sound is good but the design has a flaw and that is the connection between the line cord and the ear piece lose connectivity .
i bought these to use when playing electric guitar , so i don not disturb my wife and neighbors with my bad playing
i wanted something comfortable , durable , with a long cord
these fit the bill perfectly
they are well built , fold easily , and fit in a durable bag easily
the sound quality is excellent
i have heard static a couple of times when shifting the guitar , but that is not the fault of the headphones
i have a medium sized head , and they fit me snugly but comfortably
i can get a bit of nausea when using them , but not nearly as bad as some other headphones i have tried
i am very satisfied with these headphones , they are well worth the price .
i love these things
incredibly flat response , great for mixing live or in the studio
great for listening to music on my mp3 player
excellent build quality .
i have had these phones for <NUM> or <NUM> years , can not acctually remember
i use them daily for long periods of listening and then i will leave them for a while and go to the stuido speakers
they still look like the same model they sell now
they are extremely accurate
will rip up a bad recording and make a good one sound everything it should
the ear pads are vinyl , but under that on my was a terry cloth so i peeled the vinyl away about <NUM> years ago and they are more comfortable
i haven not heard any phones that sound any better than this in my looking around
if they give out after <NUM> or <NUM> years i will get another pair in a heartbeat
but this pair are like old blue jeans to me
you won not be disappointed with this
i think you would have to shop long and hard and spend lots more to get this quality in any other model or make .
these are some of the most comfortable headphones i have ever owned
the sound quality is good--everything comes through clearly and cleanly
unfortunately , i am running into the same problem a number of other people here have mentioned
static from the plug end
i am not sure if it is the plug itself or the wire but the slightest movement can cause static and even cause one of the speakers to cut out
it is bad enough that my android devices think i have disconnected the headphones and helpfully pause the music
i returned the first pair but the second pair had the exact same problem
i have tried them on multiple devices--phone , tablet , pc , even on a home stereo with the adapter it comes with
same problem everywhere
i am not sure what happened at sony but i'd advise staying away from these headphones until they fix the issue .
when i saw recently in sony is store ( store
com// ; pgid=m2lmcd9xx_psrp3bc5rnskm_0000uleoxrv1 ; sid=ja3p7quxlcbd7vj0oz9r6jo77tabk2kkasjjt9lj ) that the headphones have been as "new" in 2014 , and that amazon is an authorized dealer , i ordered a new pair to back up my original "made in japan" v6 cans that i have had forever as a recording engineer
the current ones are "made in thailand" and the box carries a <NUM> copyright
the new <NUM> version sounds close to my excellent japanese originals that i used for monitoring/mixing/mastering in my recording studio
evaluated using original lossless digital masters from my recording studio as the source , and measured against my studio reference akg austrian made k701s , i find the new v6 are not as well balanced across the audio spectrum as the k701 headphones
the <NUM> v6 has a noticeable boost in the low bass - educated guess , about +4db or +5db centered broadly around 70hz - making them a bit less suitable for studio work ( monitoring/mixing/mastering ) than the k701s , and about +2db or +3db higher in the low bass than my vintage headphones were when new
the <NUM> v6 has excellent mid and high range reproduction , has very good image placement/sound stage , and no audible distortion , but does not reproduce the low end of my master recordings quite as faithfully due to the low bass boost
the fit of the new v6 for me is snug without being tight or uncomfortable
leakage is minimal , if at all , at anything less than levels that will damage hearing ; and the isolation from external sounds is very good
fitment is good , and the stitching on the leather headband is well done
but physically they seem just a tad "different" somehow
the originals have the feel of solid construction
although the new ones look to be put together well , they just don not give that same sense of being as solid and durable
earpads look like the pleather that is been problematic in the past for flaking
another minor gripe - the cable of the new headphones was so tightly packed into the box that the coils are deformed in several places - but i was able to get the cable back in shape
so i have knocked off one star because of my subjective feeling about the physical qualities , and being a bit less suitable for studio monitoring/mixing/mastering than the akg k701s
i'd have to determine exactly where and how much low bass needs to be eq'd down to use these as highly accurate reference cans
that shouldn not be with headphones billed as "studio monitors" , and it is a departure from the signature of the original "made in japan" v6 headphones , which , when new , were essentially flat over the majority of the audio spectrum ( +/- 3db between 25hz and 10khz ) , as true studio monitor headphones should be
this <NUM> version of the v6 is still very good for home listening enjoyment ( they also sound darn good with my samsung galaxy s4 smartphone ) , but some may want to turn the bass control down a bit ( about 3db or so ) on the sound source
consider looking elsewhere if you need a tool to do critical , highly accurate analytic studio monitoring/mixing/mastering .
i was hesitant to spend $75 on a pair of headphones , since i had always had pairs for under $30
my $25 panasonics were great for the price , and gave excellent service until the inline volume knob started having a flaky connection
after reading the reviews on this item , i went ahead and bought a pair , and i am blown away by the difference in quality that extra $50 buys
the sonys feel very well made , and they use metal and high quality plastics that make the headphones feel sturdy
i have no doubt these will last as long as the other reviewers are claiming
as for the sound quality , these are phenomenal
i am sure headphone purists will point out that their $700 grado pair blows these away , but i haven not heard anything in this price range that even comes close
i play my bass guitar through my mixing board , and it is a model with the low string tuned to a low b
my old cheaper pair of headphones would always distort when i played full volume on the low end of the b string , and i thought i was overdriving the preamp on the mixing board , but after plugging in the sonys , i discovered it was actually the headphones
the sonys give extremely deep and clear bass reproduction all the way down to the lowest note on the bass
my only complaint is it takes about <PERCENT> volume on an ipod to get a reasonable listening volume , compared to about <PERCENT> on my old headphones
however , if you plug them into an amplified source ( such as a mixing board , headphone amplifier , home stereo receiver , etc ) you should have no trouble getting good volume .
quality is heard here
nice fit and doesn not smash my head
i wear glasses and have a hard time finding headphones that don not hurt
sound with great and drowns out back noise well .
love these , light weight , excellant high , mid and low ouput
good frequency response
no fatigue
never realized quality of the sony until you buy them
oh ! these are refurbished a steal ! look new , sound super ! happy , happy customer
i have sampled nearly the whole sony headphone line , but the v6 is notable for its flattering sound and good value
while it is unlikely to meet the requirements of a seasoned audiophile , it will delight most everyone else with its ability to render many types of music well
the pads are extremely comfortable
( however , continued use may cause the rubber to flake after several years ; beyer makes fine replacement pads
) as you'd expect from closed headphones , the sound is a little "" -- but detailed enough to do justice to anything from classical to punk
these are fun headphones capable of a nice dynamic range
the v6 doesn not try to emulate the sound of a concert hall or a studio ; rather , it offers a pleasant musical experience of its own
-- it is reasonably priced-- they play many types of music-- they are easily driven by ipods or cd players-- the v6 is ( aside from the pads ) an amazingly sturdy performerif you are picky
-- the sound is "colored" ( that is , not completely accurate ) -- they have a sound -- a result of their being closed phonesi have since graduated to the beyer dt880s , a notably better phone
but the v6 has legions of fans , for obvious reasons
even people who hate sony headphones concede the v6 is attractive sound
they have served me well for over a decade .
several notes ( mostly negative ) : 1
the cord is unbelievably heavy
and the jack is massive
it may very well be designed for durability , but these headphones are not portable in any sense
the headband just is not well designed
it is made of very wide metal , with a vinyl padded cover
the headband bows out tremendously -- i mean like inches wider than your head on either side , unless you play offensive line in the nfl
this not only looks awkward ; it feels awkward
essentially the headband makes contact only at the very center of the top of your head
this might not be a huge deal , but the headphones are quite heavy ( compared to , say , any bose headphones ) , and so you feel the whole weight of the phones on the top of your head
the earpads feel pretty nice
but when i switched back and forth between <NUM> bose headphones and these , these ones were much more cramped around your ear
so not terrible , but not all that roomy
the sound struck me as very bright
the most treble i have ever heard from any headphone or speaker
on certain songs , this is a plus , but for most , it is a bit irritating
[i listen to a wide variety of rock mostly -- from rem to snoop dogg to bob dylan to the clash to soundgarden to stevie ray vaughn]
in comparisons with other headphones , i judged these to be very light in bass
it is hard to say if they are deficient or the others are exaggerating the bass ( i am not a wannabe audiophile ) , but to me , these headphones lack fullness
on the plus side , i can hear cymbals and snare much more clearly than with most headphones
but the botom line is that i need to set my equalizer to reduce treble and/or increase bass to enjoy my music
and i am someone who rarely touches the tone settings on a stereo ( preferring a neutral sound ) and am particularly unlikely to feel the need to increase bass
they are not very loud
only a bit quieter than the boses , but if you are using an ipod , they really aren not quite loud enough in my opinion
the monster beats headphones are much , much louder , if that is a concern for you
while they do not actively cancel noise , i found them to be quite good at isolation
ambient sound was significantly reduced , arguably more so than with the boses
overall , too big and heavy and uncomfortable
i would possibly overlook these issues if the sound was incredible , but it lacks fullness in my opinion
it might be very good for some kinds of vocals and music , but not for rock music .
i got this on amazon one day sale event
these are great headphones , and in general great electronic equipment , reminding me of the great sony of the 80s , when they were making everything with great quality and absolute attention to details
the plastic is solid , the cables are soft and not sticky , the jacks are smooth , the inner steel spring is high quality and elastic and it has small marks to click and lock the headphones opening , l and r marks are different color and glued perfectly on their designated spots : ) , etc etc
small details , that are indication of how well a product was designed and made
these headphones are such a perfect product
i have very large head - for example , all my life i cannot find sunglasses wide enough to fit me
these headphones are elastic to stay firm , and open enough to fit me without causing any discomfort for several hours
yesterday i used them non stop for <NUM> hours - they are not irritating , not heating , not making my ears sweat , etc
i don not think they are tight at all , as some other reviewers mentioned
the cord is long - definitely too long for portable/gym use
these are meant to be used in static condition , in a studio/room/desktop situation
sitting in a rolling chair , one can move , turn , spin , without needing to take them off
sound fidelity - great
these are sounding great , not colored , sensitive without need
on par with everything that is not pro level and costs up to $300
definitely worth the money
i have owned and used probably around <NUM> headphones , listening from vinyls , pro level studio magnetic rolls / those ones : ) / , micro cassettes , cds , laser disks , all kinds of computer format audio , so i know about electronics
these are worth the money .
many years ago , i bought an earlier generation of these phones which i used for many years on business travel with an aiwa portable cd player to while away the hours
they disappeared after use by four of my kids while i was between trips
this new pair is once again a superbly made and designed high fidelity gift to anyone wanting really superb sound
simply plugging them into a good receiver pumping out dvd sound , and you are instantly into the world of outstanding sound from the dvd and isolated from the sounds in your environment
the bass , mid and high frequencies are perfectly balanced and extend across a wider range than my large boston acoutic <NUM> speakers
after suffering with the sporadic connection failures and static in the individual plugs on the earpieces of a $300 sennheiser earphone set ( now gone into the trash ) i am happily back with sony is v6 technology
the sound is better than the sennheisers when they were new
the bass in the sony is is spectacular and clean for any price range headphones
if these wear out before i do , i will get another set of the same ones
as long as sony keeps making the , i will keep buying them
the listing fails to mention that a very nice leatherette drawstring carrying caseis included to hold the phones and spiral wound cord when folded , just like the one that came with my first set many years ago .
fantastic range and clarity for the money
able to remixed songs with great attention to sound range separation and placement
great sound , very comfortable
i bought the headphones for a replacement for my older sony set
i bought the older sony from ebay , beware when doing this , it was a fake sony
bought at a good price but the overall quality compared to the sony was inferior
the fakes are hard to detect , there are web sites that go over ways to check .
why buy more expensive headphones unless you are into some kind of job that requires better
this head phones sound great and are very well constructed they will endure many , many years of musical pleasure
some reviewers talk about this being a little tight on their ears and that is true but thats when they are new , what i did with mine was bent them open a little bit on the sides of the headrest and that solved the problem .
these are excellent and huge step up from the sony ! the sound isolation is good and the headphones bring new life into your existing music collection
you will hear sounds you have never heard before
i also have the grado sr60 , and those are very good phones
these are just as good in terms of sound quality
they are also a significant step up from my previous sony ( which i didn not like and the foam deteriorated quickly )
i highly recommend it
as usual , amazon delivery was quick and arrived before my trip .
i am no audiophile but these are noticeably awesome
fantastic audio quality all around at a very fair price
highly recommended .
i have used these headphones before and i must say they are excellent , comfortable , and clamp like they are gonna break your skull
how ever upon ordering my own pair of these i was swindled by this dealer{{{ <URL> }}}}} aka yourdealdo not buy them from this store they are counterfeit reproductions , they are very well made counterfeits but the head band is to thick , the cups are plastic versus metal , and the over all build quality is down the tubes
do your self a favor and find a reputable dealer .
my sister is bose headphones finally died and so , her being a super audiophile without enough money to buy the stuff , i gave her my jvc and she loves them even more than the bose
so that left me with nothing , and therefore i decided to undertake the quest to find the best headphones for under $50 that i could
i looked at so many headphones , and i still loved my jvc is , but i decided i should probably try something new
and then i found these
i would say that i am
an of sorts and have just recently started to be pickier about my headphones
i can pick out minute differences in music and how headphones represent them if i really want to , but it doesn not exactly "bother" me terribly when bass is muddy or treble is harsh , etc
that being said , i loved my jvc is and was sad to see them go , but i have gotta say , i love these bad boys even more
i think it is the bass that separates them
it is punchier and more
accurate , you know ? without being overly done
out of the box they had a bit too much sibilance ( i think that is the right word ) , but they have broken in a bit and it is less harsh in that range
but the bass
otherwise they are very similar in my opinion to the jvc is
the treble might be a tad better , but not much if at all
i don not know enough of the proper wording to describe much more about it , but that is my two cents
they are also very comfortable , not too tight or anything and very soft padding
i highly recommend them , i can not imagine headphones getting that much better
i have heard beats by dre , bose , and the jvcs , and these are just the best of all of them to me .
i bought these cans after reading loads of review
i am not disappointed--these are the best headphones i have ever owned
they are great for everything from opera to electronic music
you will hear every detail in the recording , including the noise that maybe there
the sound is present , flat ( as in honest ) and lively .
this review is aimed at those with eyeglasses and whose ears get pinched between the eyeglass arms and the earphones
i do not like to block up my ears with ear plugs all day for health concerns
i have bought and used these : sony ears are not real fussy on quality , nearly all headphones give my ears a problem by pressing them against my eyeglass arms and this hurts , usually after minutes of listening
my hatsize if about 7
25 , my ears are pretty normal in size , i am middle aged
all three of these headphones i own are the best i have tried on or read reviews by eyeglass wearers over past <NUM> years
headphones have a left and right side - the cord typically is attached to the left side , and the ear spaces , or cups , are oriented accordingly , to that the back of the ear lobe has more space to sit in than the front of the ear lobe
the sideways pressure ( how hard they clamp onto your head ) also is a secondary factor in whether my ears hurt
i wear wireframe glasses , and my use for headphones is background music while i program
$30 the cd230 is no longer available , that i could find ( fall 2006 ) , and i have used them for <NUM> years
they hurt my ears after hours of continual use , but are good before that
they have cloth covered ear cushions , and relatively deep ear lobe spaces
this feature in all earphone seems to be the primary feature that determines whether my ears hurt or not
if you can find these , and like cloth covered headphones , you won not be unhappy
the sideways pressure is light for me
$64 the v6 stands out for <NUM> things - richness and accuracy of the sound and blocking out outside office noises
listening to classical music , not real loud , a can speak to my face and his voice is muffled pretty well
( women is voices too )
overheard conversations are not overheard
i have used these occaisionally for a couple months and my ears/head get sore after hours
the sideways pressure is noticeably more than the other two , but not excessive
they are well cushioned , with soft fake thin vinyl which i did not find causes sweating at all
but there is not a large space for the ear lobes to sit , and this is what causes pressure after a while to build up uncomfortably i am sure
if i did not have my eyeglasses on , then these are very comfortable
$26 the xd200 is a little lighter than the v6 , it does not block out outside noises as well , which can be a benefit in the office because i can hear calling my name
the sideways pressure is light , the cushion is the same thickneess as the v6 but the ear space is much deeper for the earlobe , so for this reason it is the most comfortable of all headphones i have owned or tried
the cushions are covered in the thin vinyl like the v6 - this stuff feels like a paper much more than a plastic , it feels dry , not clammy
to my unprofessional ears the sound is great
if you wear eyeglasses , don not want to use ear plugs for hours at a stretch , then i think you will be happiest with the sony headphones .
these sound great once they break in
i can wear them for hours without fatigue and they are built like tanks compared to some others on the market .
i truly and honestly don not get the rave reviews
i am no super audiophile , but i have a decent surround sound system , appreciate good sound and deep bass
i love hearing fine details in and mastered music like a guitar strum
and i swear $40 phones of just about any random brand have better richer sound than these
i tried them in my surround system , tried them in my iphone , ipad , imac , pc , and everywhere it sounded like i had two , muddy tin cans
i guess i must be crazy , because everyone else seems to love these
i returned and got cheaper phones , because the sound is much much better .
and i have never found a superior pair of headphones , period
they are comfortable ( with one small adjustment )
they have fantastic sound
and for the price ( almost always less than a hundred bucks , sometimes much less ) even if they do fail or wear out ( which they almost never do ) , they are easily replaced
i can not handle buds -- my canals are too small and they always hurt
headphones are a joke
these are perfection
that one small adjustment i mentioned ? get a pair of beyerdynamic edt <NUM> velour replacement pads and suddenly these headphones become the last pair you will ever need .
no question this product is full on , <NUM> star material
i received a pair of these phones in <NUM> ( maybe 1990 , not sure ) , as a birthday present from my aunt and uncle
since receiving them , i have taken them with me all over the world
i have slept with them on my head on <NUM> hour flights , i have slept with them in my bed , they have been abused and trounced in all kinds of luggage
not only do these things sound incredible , they obviously hold up very well considering the abuse i have heaped upon mine and they are still working and sounding perfectly after these eighteen ( 18 ) years
i am in awe of their
i have replaced the ear pads once , with these beyer dynamic velour pads ( highly recommended btw ) : [
]i am <NUM> years old , and wondering if i will be willing these things to one of my children ? ! : )
nice sound without burning a hole in your pocket
i also have yamaha pro 300
both are good
sound qualityof both is very close but each has its own distinct quality
i like the yamaha one being lighter but it costs a lot more
i just switch between them .
that is what these headphones create for me
the sound quality is nothing less than awesome , from deep , bass to clear ( sade , billy joel and etta james just sound divine ! ) to sharp ( but not overbearing ) highs
the dynamic range is astounding
you will hear little details in songs you never noticed before
i am sure you could find better headphones , for a lot more money
but unless you have the hearing of a dog , you are not going to notice enough of a difference to make the extra hundred dollars or so worth your while
if you are willing to spend some dough , but not wanting to pay a mint , these are highly recommended
my only caveat is that the fit is a little snug
in a way it is good , because it helps keep background noise out without the distortion that noise cancellation can introduce
these are ideal for noisy environments where you want to be alone with your sound
but i could see where individuals with wider than average heads might experience a bit of discomfort with prolonged use
if i take my glasses off while wearing these headphones , i generally have to take the headphones off to put my glasses back on
but then again , eyeglasses and headphones are always an awkward mix .
unbelievable headphones
although they may hurt on your head after minutes , the sound quality makes them worth it .
i love these headphones
they fell really good on your ears , they are made of that soft like material and the compression on your head is not bad at all
oh the sound , yeah they rock !
i am %100 satisfied with this purchase
if these disappeared , i would buy a replacement set immediately
the build quality is top notch , much better than you'd expect from the photo
other headphones have chinsy hinges , or oversized plastic hinges to appear that they are built well , but when you feel these in your hands , you will know that they will last
the cord and plug are both pro grade also
the audio quality is great
are there better sounding phones ? maybe
i have had some very expensive sennheisers , sonys , a few random off brands and a pair of grados , all which sounded great
these sony is hang with them
if you can find a pair that sounds better , that pair will be $500 , and it won not blow these sony is out of the water but just barely edge them out on a few details
comfort is good
the foam goes fully around your ear ( circumaural ) and they are a closed can design so they &<HASHTAG> ; block out&<HASHTAG> ; outside sounds
they aren not &<HASHTAG> ; noise isolating&<HASHTAG> ; or &<HASHTAG> ; noise reducing&<HASHTAG> ; , but they block enough to put you in your own audio space
if you listen with these , you won not hear the phone ringing in the other room
if you have sweaty ear syndrome or don not like headphones that are closed , these might not be up your alley
that is only a preference though and not a ding against these headphones
i personally really like the closed , circumaural design
the band and the ear pressure are exactly right
in ten years , after you have worn through the ear pads , replacements will still be readily available online
overall , these are the industry standard for a reason
time tested , excellent quality , unbeatable value
buy these headphones , you will be satisfied with them for sure .
great sound
comfortable on head and ears
ears do get warm after a <NUM> minute movie
i hope they last a long time .
these are the best headphones that i have ever owned
i am prone to headaches , i work in a loud environment , and i like high quality sound
these headphones block out a lot of noise , don not squeeze too tightly on my head , and have incredible sound quality
i am very happy !
great sound quality , great value
highly recommend them
i used to break headphones all the time ( 1 pair every <NUM> months ) , now these have lasted me at least a year
great value
just buy them .
there is not much to say other than the sound is great and the headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time
highly recommended .
the headphones i just purchased replaced a faithful pair i have had now for <NUM> years
now that i have the new pair i can definitely say that over the years , the old ones lost a lot of bass even though i have replaced the ear pads , and the new pair sounds like i remember the old ones sounding when they were new
all the bass is there , all the highs and definitely all the midrange
the musical detail is extraordinary
i count on these headphones to hear things up close and personal when i am doing productions and have never found a pair that sounded anywhere near what i get from these
glad i was still able to get a pair of these v6 is
they are <HASHTAG> in my book !
amazing headphone value
if you want big booming bass , pick up a set of crossfades
if you want to hear subtle nuances in your music which you never new were there before , then these are the phones for you
very light and incredibly comfortable to boot
quite honestly , i can not imagine how someone could complain that these give a tight fit
i generally use these with my nuforce icon dac , google play music , and my toshiba chromebook
however , i think they shine the best when using the dac along with my onkyo c7030 .
as an armature to the hifi sound devices , i have no complain about it so far
it is an excellent product on every aspects in terms of comfortableness , construction quality , sound quality and etc
after retracted , the whole thing is bit of bulky
it is not a portable product for carrying around in your backpack
also rigid and cheaper looking leather bag is not a match for this earphone
i'd rather to have a soft cloth bag for it .
i have used more than a few headphones over the years , including some sennheiser pro studio models
the sennheiser' are typically uncomfortable after an hour or two , so if you plan to spend time at a board they can be painful , and depending on how long you where them the pain can last a day or two
the sony v6 headset is very comfortable enough so that i have used them all night well actually all day and night without experiencing much discomfort , and the sound in my opinion is superior to anything i have tried recently
in the last few years i have switched to using earbuds for most of my casual listening and simply had forgotten how great a decent full size headset sounds
over all , i have found this set to be very true reproducing recorded music , and are better than anything i have used in the sub $150
00 price range
one test i have used to compare sound reproduction in the past is to listen to a clean recording of a few acoustic instruments , especially the sound of a piano
if a headset can reproduce the timber and resonance of a full size piano they are usually a good bet
being a acoustic string guy i also look at how well a set will reproduce the sound of a high end acoustic guitar , mandolin and violin
if they are accurate on those simple tests then i would grab them
this set does a fantastic job of reproducing the sound of everything i listen for with exceptional precision
i paid a lot more than a $100
00 for my sennheiser' but this set sounds better and is much more comfortable to wear even for short periods of time
i would highly suggest anyone looking at these give them a try and see for yourselves just how good these sound
the range from <NUM> khz should be ample for anyone though the bass is not exaggerated it is clean tight and powerful enough for myself anyway
honestly these would be a very good choice for home studio or for casual listening , and if you have been spending hundreds on earbuds you have to give these a try .
 <NUM> year old audio engineer , video shooter/editor , former radio host
i used 7506s for my video shoots for many years
they are wonderful
these v6s are every bit as great
light comfy , straight excellent sound
if you are gonna get a cramp because it doesnt have a red pro sticker on the side , get 7506s
if you want equally great headphones at steal of a price buy the v6s here , you will be very happy
get these phones , and live happily ever after .
these headphones sound wonderful
they are a very faithful reproducer of audio , so you are hearing what the people who made your music or moves want you to hear - not what the people who made your headphones want you to hear
i love that i can listen to dance , orchestral , rock , rap , or basically any style of music with these
the other neat thing about these headphones is that they are standard equipment at nearly every studio ever
so you are more than likely listening on the same headphones that the engineers who mixed down your music used
the simple fact is that these headphones blow $200 beats and other 'designer' headphones out of the water
they just faithfully reproduce sound instead of slamming you with pure bass
one drawback , which might just be a personal thing : they are too narrow for my head
i could just have a wide head , but i feel like the arms are pushing too hard against the sides of my head
i realize that this is partly necessary for good sound ( keeps the earcups seated on your ears ) but i feel like it could be toned down a bit .
i bought these because i was looking for a nice pair of headphones that sounded as good as the ones i remembered using as a kid when i had to listen to music through headphones while not disturbing my parents watching tv
little did i know that sony still makes the same model ! that is right , some <NUM> years later , i now own my own pair of the exact same headphones
if the fact that sony still makes the same headphones without any changes doesn not say enough about these , then nothing i say would do much justice , but i will try anyway
i have a 24" head and despite the other reviewers who have said these headphones fit too tightly , i bought them anyway
once i got them i did notice they are a bit tight , but since i have no plans to sit in one spot for more than a few hours with these on , this is not a concern to me
plus , in time i expect them to loosen up a bit simply through constant use
the padding on the ears are very nice , but i can see how wearing these for hours on end might get a bit annoying , but that would probably happen with anything you put on/in your ears
once on , i can not think of any other headphones i have tried that sound as good
for my desktop speakers , i use aklipsch promedia 2
1 thx certified computer speaker system ( black ) that sounds amazing when playing songs through itunes or pandora , so i needed something better than the apple earphones i was using when i didn not want to blast out my roommates
the headphones do just that
of course they don not have the same punch as a floored subwoofer , but surprisingly , the bass in these headphones is quite noticeable
until i bought these , i wasn not even really using the itunes equalizer
now as i change music , i change the eq because the headphones make you hear sounds you have never heard before ! i feel like going back through all my music just to see what i have been missing .
these are a great pair for the price , ~35 cheaper than the mdr7506i have just started listening to the v6s and have had the mdr7506s for a little over a year
honestly , you get what you pay for most of the time , except for the mdr <NUM> and v6 cans
they both are undeniable stars in the headphones scene
the difference between the v6 and mdr7506 is very small , but there is a difference , both in sound ( maybe my v6s just need to break in , but i generally don not believe in the break in process for speakers ) the mdr7506 from the very beginning were absolutely amazing
very natural sounding , great ability to pick out little details in well recorded music
i loved listening to some of the eagle is stuff on them , they have some crisp clean string sounds and well recorded drums
they are loose fitting on the ears somewhat , keeps your ears feeling free and comfortable
the cable is very good rubber , limber and returns to it is shape over a few minutes if left in a knot or stretched out
the v6s have an almost equally amazing sound , more bass response than the mdr7506
seems that they lack ( just very so slightly ) the clarity of the mdr7506
earpads are more of a matt finish and firmer than the 7506s
the cable on these is no doubt quality , and will last years under normal circumstances , but the 'nice' factor is not the same feel
the actual plug is just like that on the 7506 , same screw on 1/4" adapter , but the shell is nickel finished instead of black , and the contacts on the plug are nickel plated instead of gold plated
nickel is actually preferable , against popular belief , because a majority of the jacks it will be plugged into in it is life will have nickel plated contacts , and dissimilar metals will corrode when touching
not really a problem in a clean , dry studio , but the ideal thing is always to be kept in mind
in the end , if you are looking for good headphones for studio or engineering of some kind , go with the 7506 , if you are doing an at home studio or just want bang for the buck to plug into your ipod , the v6s are where it is at .
i have heard problems about is on this site , but this isn not one of them
build quality is very good
sounds amazing ( my first pair of real cans )
my parents had just bought <NUM> pairs of bose oe2 is for $99 , and both agreed that my cheaper v6 is sound better ! my only complaint is that the bass runs a bit thin for my tastes
but it is actually pretty accurate
these are not the beats that sound best with rap music and not much else ; the v6 is sound amazing with everything from classical to rock to r&b ; to soul to primus
my iphone 4s drives them good enough to not &<HASHTAG> ; need&<HASHTAG> ; a headphone amplifier ( but of course i still &<HASHTAG> ; want&<HASHTAG> ; one , lol )
be forewarned though ; these cans reproduce the sound so accurately that now , mp3s now annoy the heck out of me
i can even hear the difference between my 128kbps aac is and my lossless alac files
i finally had an excuse to a bunch of cds into 256kbps aac and/or alac now
very comfortable , even for hours at a time
i want to try the velvet ear pads just to see how they are , but the stock ones are still very comfortable
if you are on the fence , and you don not need a huge bottom end , these won not disappoint you .
i originally bought these headphones to go with our digital piano , but my wife didn not see any need for them , so they became my computer headphones
darn : di want to start out by pointing out that these headphones have a very soft feel on the head , yet are firm enough to not fall off
sound quality is extremely important to me , not just blasting bass or highs or anything
these have excellent fidelity
you can hear the highs , the lows , and the mids very clearly on this set , and one is not overpowered by the others
one thing i have noticed about headphones is the fact that when you have too many things going on in music ( or games , or movies ) some parts start to literally get lost as the headphones simply cannot handle that many streams simultaneously
these headphones do not have that problem
after reading the reviews from people who have enjoyed theirs for ten to twenty years , i look forward to a long relationship with these
i listen to a wide variety of music , and everything from linkin park to mozart sounds great on these headphones , as well as a wide variety of pc games ranging from thrillers where hearing clearly is essential to survival , to fps games with explosions and gunshots
i have noticed with these phones , i feel like i have my 5
1 system on , and have to take them off to ensure i am not being obnoxious to my neighbors , only to learn that it is simply the quality of the headphones that i am hearing
the same thing happened with our digital piano , i thought i was hearing the piano outside of my headphones as well as inside them , but that was not the case
anyone who is disappointed by these either has ridiculous expectations , or they do not know what sound quality is
update 2/15/2013so , i wanted to get on here and make another comment on the comfort and noise reduction
i have put them on when i sat down at my computer , only to realize an hour later i was still wearing them , and not listening to any music
they are comfortable enough to forget that they are on , and the are noise cancelling enough that they literally cut the noise levels in the room in half
i continue to love them .
i had a pair of sennheiser hd 208 is i believe , man these things destroy them
first of all they aren not tight , at least on my head , so they rest comfortably
second the sound quality is amazing ! no wonder they have had these cans selling for decades ! if you have an eq on your pc , then you can raise the bass a little if you are feeling frisky ( lol )
i use them for some mxing and casual listening and they are great so far ! anyway with that said these headphones are great and at $50 ( when i bought it ) they rival a lot foof the higher end headphone ! definitely in my recommendation for a good set of headphones !
another positive review for this , surprising it is relatively cheap compared to other budget headphones
nothing more to add than what is already said , this one is definately one to add to your collection , even if this is the only one in your collection
these headphones are great ! they give what some people call a flat sound
just the way an acoustical instrument woud sound in a room without an echo
in other words no excentuated highs , basses or midrange
they are ruggedly constructed for professional use
they are also pretty comfortable with one slight drawback
the plastic padding around each phone fits so snugly around my ears that my ears eventualy get a little too warm
buy them
you wont be sorry .
i bought these headphones to use at home and at church
i am involved in the multimedia ministry at my church and these really do a great job
you won not be disappointed if you get them .
first bought these back in <NUM> along with a sony diskman with my first paycheck
these headphones have been used along with my sony diskman , ipods ( gen 1 , <NUM> and 6 ) , home stereo and gaming pc is since i got them
it has outlived most of the tech i had plugged them into and kept on kicking until a friend stole them
bought a replacement pair in <NUM> on amazon and just got around to reviewing them
these headphones sound great when i first bought them and still do now
they opened my ears to cleaner sounds when listening to music that default electronic headphones don not pick up
i have taken these with me while riding the bus , long car trips and on the airplane
they can be compacted to be taken on the go and stuffed in a bag
so they are very portable even come with a leatherish bag to be carried in
they are very comfortable enough to be worn for extended periods of time
even taken long naps and slept with them over night
they do make your head warm after extended hours of use but that goes for any over the ear headphones
they are very adjustable you can wear them on one ear and the other behind the head and wont fell like your head is in a vice
only problem i ever had with them is that the earpads start to flake off after a while
but you can get replacement pads that don not flake
but i cant knock the rating down for that since i had these for such a long time and since it has outlived several gaming headsets just to get plugged back in .
so sweet and sublime , there isn not anything here that shouldn not be
great separation and pure , rich sound as it was intended
awesome , flavored with cool
buy a pair and find out for yourself
rock on .
i spend at least <NUM> hours a week in these mixing music professionally
i have owned mine since the late 80s and have two pair : one for home and one for work
i have replaced the earpads about every <NUM> years
these are quite simply one of the best ten products i have ever owned
the sound quality is unparalleled
they are efficient enough to be driven loud from a computer or an ipod
i have a super large head and these are very comfortable
those of you complaining they are too tight don not understand how to adjust them - pull the earpieces down if they are too tight
i have never found a better pair at any price
the fact that these are under $100 , last essentially forever , and sound superb , is a modern miracle
flat frequency response as high as any human ear can hear and lower than most any equipment can produce , and yet the sound is pleasing from just about any source
buy a pair of them without hesitation
you will never regret it .
i am not an expert on this but based on the quality of the output sound , i would definitely recommend these
i also have sennheisers at the same price and i felt sony this was better than those head headphones
they are very comfortable on your head and you can wear them for hours without any problem
they look very good and come with a very nice leather pouch and nice packing .
i have bought two pairs of these now , only because one was a gift to my dad
they are the best sounding i have used for the budget ( and budgets hundreds higher )
just know the ear pad will start to fall apart after awhile , i think it was around two years for me .
bought these because of their range
glad i did
only problem i have is the cord
it may be <NUM> feet long but because it is coiled you really are limited to where you can go
go too far and out comes the plug or down goes the stereo
just need to limit your range
no biggie
i just move the chair closer to the stereo
also , the cushions are fit just right around my ears where they do a good job of blocking out outside noises .
these are , by far , the best headphones i have ever owned
sony got it right when they invented the is , and that is why they have stayed pretty much the same ( even the packaging ) for about <NUM> years
i'd recommend them to anyone .
and terrific sound
you don not need to spend $200+ on the good doctor is prescription : )
these are a very wise , economical , and sound worthy choice .
the headphones sound fine , they are comfortable enough -- but this cord is a
as other reviewers have noted , it is very heavy due to its substantial coiling -- and as a result it will not comfortably rest on any surface yet cannot be left dangling because it is too heavy ! maybe an example would suffice
if i plug these into my mac tower while sitting at my desk , the cord is too short to not start engaging the coils -- which produces tension and then tugs on the headphones -- eventually causing the plug to pop out of the computer
what is worse is that the cord refuses to rest on he desk either without sliding off because ( once again ) it is too short and the coils are too heavy
i have to secure it down which is harder than it might seem without duct tape , plus it really restricts my movement
for this alone , i would recommend another set .
based on all the recommendations on amazon and around the internet , this was the best model at my target price
the product actually exceeded my expectations
the sound is superior and the headset is very comfortable
as expected , sony has not had to update this model for years because you can not improve upon perfection at this price point .
i like this headset , sound quality was great ! note : cord is long
no i mean really long
it has an adapter for the large audio jackthey are adjustable for sizethe ear pads are nice and soft
these have become the preferred headphones of choice for tracking
i wasn not expecting much when i picked up a pair of these on black friday for $40
i have had numerous people google these after using them to see where they can get them in town quicker
these are the real deal .
it is not a solid <NUM> star , but it still deserves it
at this price , the sound quality is wonderful
i did with an app on android , using pink noise
before the , the sound is good but not smooth enough
now it just sounds right
the sound is much smoother
good build quality
nicely packaged
a decent leather bag is included
now the cons or insufficiency : 1
don not expect light weight but it is ok ; 2
cable is "telephone wire" , maybe good for moving around in studio , but ugly and unnecessary for other use ; 3
the can doesn not hug your head tightly
it is comfy for home use but you probably can not go commuting unless you walk smoothly like a snail
overall , a great quality headphone for the price
try it with flac/ape against other can , you will feel the great sound quality .
good set of cans for mixing and hearing they sound as it was recorded
if you want something for recreational music listening , these might not be for you thought i don not see why these couldn not be used for that
these have a good rep for a reasonable priced headphone for audio mixers etc .
i purchased these on black friday , i use them for my ipod touch 4th generation
the sound these produce completely removed the need to use any eq settings on my ipod
i mostly listen to pop , rock , and rap so i can say highs are great , mids are good , bass is excellent and clear , and no noise distortion
i can not speak to how well the build of the headphones will last overtime , but so far they seem durable
they are a good choice if you plan on owning a high quality or audiophile version of headphones
the only thing i absolutely hate is the longgggggg cable
i can not work it with it , it dangles over my legs , jumps up and down with me
if sony could make a short version cable these would easily destroy , beats , souls , audio technica and all of the otherhighly marketed headphones .
i just bought these trying to save a little money over the mdr7506
i have used the <NUM> headphones for probably <NUM> some years now , replacing them when the earcups started to break down ( this is my third set )
i listen every day to speakers and headphones
i now have both models and can compare them
in my opinion ( and please no hate mail ) i think the 7506 is sound better
they are slightly clearer and produce more air if you know what i mean
bass is good on both but once again i think it is slightly cleaner with the pro phones
one writer mentioned about the gold plating wearing off of the connector
i plug my phones in and out all the time ( for years ) and the connector still looks perfect
no wear at all !
maybe that coonector has something to do with the sound difference
i dont know but if i had to do it all over again i would spend the extra money and buy the mdr 7506
dont get me worng
the v6 is a good phone but for my ears the other set is the way to go .
santa brought me these after i had done some extensive research
i have always been content spending a little extra money for quality and peace of mind ; these headphones are one of the rare occurrences when you can get an incredible product at an extremely reasonable price
lightweight , comfortable and sturdily built headphones with an incredibly balanced sound
bass is very accurate and complements vocals and instruments nicely
find myself wearing these for hours on end with no irritation , although clearly head and ear shape vary greatly , the will be a steady companion of mine for the foreseeable future .
the sound that these headphones reproduces is simply amazing
right away i was astonished by the vast details , crisp vocals and all the little details that was intended to be heard by the artist ! for under $100 , this is one of the best in that price range , it even sounds better than some higher priced headphones ! this definitely sounds better than my beats , and bose headphones ! these headphones are also very comfortable , feels much more durable than beats and bose
based on other reviews , it seems that these headphones will last a long time ! buy it , don not hesitate , you won not regret it ! : )
hello , this is my first review for the sony with ccaw voice coil
soundfirst i would like to mention that these headphones sound pretty amazing
i have had bad headphones in the past that had terrible bass or treble , but for me its very well balanced
the only complaint about sound is that if you play any songs that has a lot of treble in it , it may not sound as comfortable in the high ranges
some people mentioned about a &<HASHTAG> ; boomy bass&<HASHTAG> ; and i disagree
i think the bass is completely fine ( i still need to go hear some hardcore bass drop of a dubstep though )
i like bass a lot and i put my ipod with bass boost and it still sounds fine without being &<HASHTAG> ; boomy&<HASHTAG> ; or &<HASHTAG> ; vibrating
&<HASHTAG> ; i listened with my galaxy s4 and that sounded fine as well
comfortsome people complained that the headband hurts while others say its comfortable
for me , it was pretty comfortable , but not as comfortable as i thought
at first , it is going to hurt the top of your head for a bit , but after you wear it for a couple of days the goes away
right now after <NUM> week , i don not complain about the headband at all
just like any other it does get sweaty a bit , so don not wear it for too long unless you have air blowing in your face the whole time : p
buildthe build is pretty solid , but the plastic on the sides makes it feel slightly cheap , but its not much to complain about
it is well built overall and it is portable which is a plus for me
accessoriesit comes with a bag that you can put your headphones in , which is pretty nice and unexpected
also it comes with a 1/4&<HASHTAG> ; screw on
problem i had with this screw on is that when i took it back out , for whatever reason the 1/8&<HASHTAG> ; connector bent in the middle slightly ( maybe because i screwed it on too tight or something
) i just bent it back with the 1/4&<HASHTAG> ; adapter putting it slightly in and bending it the other way and it was fine
otheranother thing i noticed was that the cable end doesn not really fit well into my s4 when it has its case on
i have to shove it in a little bit for it to go all the way in
because it is also with a metal end ( which makes it pretty solid instead of a cheap plastic one ) i sometimes have problems connecting it to devices like the ipod and s4
but if you just give it a slight push then it should go all the way in
i wish the 1/8&<HASHTAG> ; was a tiny bit longer so that it wouldn not have to be shoved in
pros : - great sound quality
for the most part balanced
- it is actually quite comfortable once you get used to it
- it is portable- it has the coiled wire so it doesn not tangle so easily- it comes with a convenient 1/4&<HASHTAG> ; cable
i use it for my yamaha digital piano
- it doesn not squish your ears , but isolates a lot of sound if you have sound running through the headphones
- solid metal endingcons : - high range in treble can get screechy ( but that is if you go really high ) - it is uncomfortable at first to the top of your head
- the wire is a little bit too long
- the metal end sometimes makes it uncomfortable to insert into devices like the ipod or your phone
tl ; dr : it is very good product for headphones under $100 .

my system begins with a sennheiser short shotgun mic into a sound devices <NUM> mixer ( which can power the mic ) , the into a juicedlink rm222 then into a nikon d800 , then recording to the hdmi output to an atomos ninja
to monitor , i plug my trusty mdrv6 is into the monitor out of the <NUM> mixer , which is listening via its return to the headphone output of the nikon
with a knob turn , i can then listen to any of the mixer is three inputs directly or to the camera is return confidence feed
if it sounds good in the sony mdrv6 is , it will sound good in the edit
yes , there are way more expensive headphones , but i know how the mdrv6 is sound , i trust them , and they never break
the biggest problem is coworkers &<HASHTAG> ; borrowing&<HASHTAG> ; them and not returning them
write your name on them in large letters .
i just picked up a set at fry is at lunch , and agree with the others here that they are comfortable and sound very good
unfortunately , the soft earcups are very susceptible to any little noise source , including movement of eyeglass frames and touching/scratching your cheek
i really wish that stores would have headphones on display so that you could find things like this out at the store
i also think that the earcups will get hot and sweaty with extended use
so far the bose triports are the only units that i have found that are comfortable and don not create this noise from rubbing , but i don not particularly like their sound , plus they cost twice what these do .
great quality in sound and are quite durable
we use a pair at work to monitor camera sound during interviews and it blocks exterior noise well without completely blocking off sound so you can still hear your fellow crew
folds down to a manageable size , and comes with a cheapo leather pouch that does the job
for the $60 or so bucks i paid for it i really can not find anything wrong with it or any reason to go for a more expensive model
if you want beats headphones , take the stickers off the side and use a white sharpie and write a b
good set of features for the price for sure .
everywhere you find quality reviews of these headphones ( including audiophile sites ) , the v6 ranks highly
they sound great for all kinds of music as well as for monitoring audio during video editing
probably not suited for audio mixing as these phones are made for great sound , not the sort of flat response you'd probably want for mixing
these phones sit on top of my ears , and as other reviewers have noted , they can get a bit warm and little too snug after a couple hours of wearing them
however , i don not wear them too long in any one sitting , so it doesn not bother me .
bought for my daughter for her sound engineering class
they are versatile ( 2 types of connection ) for home and studio
great sound high and low frequency and buffer ambient sound pretty well
highly recommend
not the best money can buy , but a good deal .
have you been considering good headphones ? have you searched the net and looking for advice ? look no further
if you want open headphones , choose the sennheiser px100 or grado sr60 or sr80
if you want closed , there is no better choice under $150 than the
beware the other sony models - they have a few good ones , but most are not so good , even a few that are pricier than this one
this is the same headphone ( except for cosmetics ) as the to drive with or without an not hesitate - you won not regret these ! update 6/2010 : these are still great , but shure has since introduced two models ( the and 840 ) that are very nice and worth a listen , some will certainly prefer them to the sony
the <NUM> is very close in price as well
also worth considering is the denon and , which when on sale are around $100
the denons have great sound , perhaps slighlty more appealing to me than the sony , but the denon has absolutely the best comfort in any headphone that sounds decent and is under $500
the sony wins on ruggedness and value , though , and the sound isn not worlds apart .
for studio monitoring , you can not go wrong with these
the sennheiser hd <NUM> pro , are a heftier , build , have a flatter response , and all parts are replaceable , but it is good to have more than one tool in this area
this being my second pair of sony , my son destroyed my original pair in an electronic music class , after he "borrowed" them , i found sonically , i was missing something by just using the sennhiesers
the sony is have deeper bass and an extended high end , which makes them more "musical"
the quality for the price can not be beat
in fact for listening to music , i would recommend these , over any other headphone under $100
you have to trust so many positive reviews , these are classics ! addendum 12/4/2011i added the beyer dynamic padded ear cushions , and these headphones are a lot more comfortable
i noticed immediately , that the bass response went way up , maybe not such a good thing for critical monitoring and mixing
i am just wondering why ? i did notice when i took the original sony pads off , there is an additional layer , albeit thin , of foam , behind the velour
perhaps this is why
also as often discussed , headphones get a sweeter sound after about a <NUM> to <NUM> hour "break in" period
the sony is definitely get smoother with age .
these headphones are amazing
the sound quality is great
neutral to some extent
the bass is true , the is strong , and the treble is clear
the supplied 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch adapter lets you use your headphones on your home theater
these headphones can really handle all the power from your amplifier and can actually benefit when you start adjusting the sound
the stock earpads are okay
i bought the beyerdynamic pads which are way more comfortable than the supplied ones
plus , they add a bit more bass , which is great
these cans have the reputation of being extremely tough
i can not really say much about that , since i have owned them for a couple of months barely
but i am hoping to get some years from these .
good value for the money
very nice sound quality and comfortable to wear for long periods .
i find myself in agreement with almost everyone else
i lay no claim to having an educated ear , but i have anyone is subjective ability to distinguish better sound quality from not so good sound quality
these headphones are definitely in the "better" category
i bought these 'phones to wear during keyboard practice so i wouldn not annoy others in the room
i quickly found they were so good that i started plugging them into the laptop when i wanted to watch a flick or listen to something on line
i imagine they will replace every other pair or headphones or earbuds in the house
i don not have comfort issues with them , but am sometimes annoyed at their tendency to fold up when i take them off for a moment
i'd rather fold my own headphones , thank you , not have a spring system do it for me
old guy alert : i am closer to <NUM> than 60 , and i have the usual hearing deficiency
in the real world i can barely hear the top two or three notes on a piano
through these headphones the tones are still faint , but clearer
i take that to mean that the pads are screening out some of the aural clutter that will bury all but the loudest high tones for me
all in all , very satisfied .
i like these headphones a lot
it is been years since i have had headphones and there is no comparison in both comfort and sound vs earbuds
these are like being in concert
the is have a nice , neutral sound , meaning they are not overly base heavy but more realistic to what natural sound would be
the cord is coiled and doesn not detach from the headset
so for those who want everything to come apart these wouldn not do it
i use them primarily to listen to music when i am using my computer and sometimes when i am playing something i haven not heard in a while , like yes , i just have to stop and appreciate the music again
wonderful experience .
these are well made headphones and have excellent response in the mid to high end frequencies but come up just a little short in the deep bass response
i did try them with several different sources
i listen to pretty much everything classic , counrty , folk , rock , you name it ( not much on rap or techno )
compared to my harmon kardon and pioneer speakers or even cheap skull candy earbuds these headphones just didn not cut it for bass .
i was really hoping that these would provide sound reproduction
i was pretty disappointed when i plugged them in for the first time
i got a second opinion from my brother , and he didn not have anything nice to say about them either
they have a particular warm sound that some people may appreciate , but it is like have a eq on the headphones that you can never change
i personally like speakers ( e
b&w ; , and i like denon receivers for this reason ) and in this category the v6s don not perform well at all
another problem : i am picky about comfort
these headphones were not comfortable for me at all
i could wear them for about <NUM> hour before i absolutely had to take them off
i am picky about my headphones , so i gave these to my friend and i am still on the prowl for a better set
i have since listened to the v600s , and i prefer the v600s to these ( although i am still not sure if i will settle on the v600s )
one more thought : and anybody saying that these have no bass is out of their mind !
i bought <NUM> different sets of headphones and this is the set i ended up keeping
these are comfy , sound great , and feel like they will stand up to my daily uses
did i mention they sound awesome ? >
over <NUM> years ago , i had started working at circuit city and i wanted to buy a good pair of headphones , especially since i got an employee discount of store cost
: - ) i tried on all the headphones on the rack , not listening to anything ; i just snapped my fingers and listened to how well each headphone muffled the sound
the sony pair did the best job
based on that , i bought them
imagine my shock when i listened to them and realized that they gave me better sound than my actual speakers did ! over the <NUM> years since then , the padding disintegrated , and in my last move , they got
a bit crunched
i was heartbroken , as i remember sony replacing the v6 with a far lesser pair of v600 headphones
they had ( i thought ) renamed the v6 and tripled the price
not so , apparently ! i found my current pair of v6s right here on amazon for the exact price i'd paid for them ( at cost , remember ) back in 1987 ! ( 9/20/13 edit : i bought them for sixty dollars both times ; i have seen them go <PERCENT> higher on amazon , but as long as they are less than a hundred , they are still worth it
) if you have any desire to hear your music without distraction , if you want the headphones that professionals use , if you want to have sounds coming at you that you cannot even *hear* but more feel , then buy these headphones ! the sound quality is unparalleled in its price range
even going double or triple the price does not guarantee you a better pair of headphones , but there are some at higher prices
point is , you don not need to go that high for 'phones
the cord may seem like overkill , but when you need to get up from your chair to close that window , or answer the phone you left on the cradle on the other side of the room , or to look out the front window to see whatever , you will appreciate not being tethered
those ten feet equal freedom of movement that couples with phenomenal sound
the phones even let you do that little thing you see professionals do in those shows , where they flip an earpiece over and hold it up to their ear without putting the band over their head ! or , flip one *while* it is over your head to enable a friend to listen to what you are listening to ! i have read some people saying that these phones are uncomfortable
i cannot imagine how that is possible
the padding is quite comfortable ( if in the earpads ) , and they manage to be snug without being constricting
these are , of course , not headphones to be worn while exercising unless you really want your ear pads soaked in sweat
but that aside , these studio monitors will faithfully reproduce any sound you can throw at them , and never give you distortion from having the music turned up too loud
you may go deaf from it
but it won not be distorted ! : - )
i love these , i went through a couple of headphones before i found these and i had planned to try as many as possible until i found the ones i was completely happy with , well i stopped
i tried the jvc black series and a couple of bose and none of them sounded like what i was looking for , not that they where bad , just not what i was looking for
these sound exactly like what i had in mind , the sound is very clear and crisp , i am hearing parts of my music that i never even knew where there
i listen to a lot of different genres ; rap , r&b , rock , and hip hop to name a few
everything sounds great , the only thing about these is that if your looking for thumping bass these aren not for you , not that they don not have bass , its just not thumping bass but definitely there
before you go and spend over a $100 on bose or anything else i would give these a look , you won not regret it .
the quality of sound from these phones is fantastic
easily , wonderful sound
thanks .
if you want better sound get the 50mm versions ( mdr6506 ? )
anyway , this is what we use in professional studios
aint nothing expensive to buy
how do you like that ? this is what the record you are listening to was mastered with !
i have tested bose around ear headphones ( not the noise canceling version ) and my sony beat bose by far ! bose got a softer cushion and better response in the very low frequency at 16hz , but sony are far more consistent with the output level throughout the entire response range
hz on sony sound all at almost the same level - very nice flat response sony have indeed
it will let you hear all the things in your tracks the good and the bad of mastering - you can hear them all on sony is
but with bose the bass will sound better and that is it - nothing else ! i am so happy i got the instead of bose ! ( when i got my sony both were almost same price
i am listening to linda ronstadt singing , someone to watch over me , as i write this
the sound is clear
there is no overbearing bass , just enough , the high notes sparkle like nye champagne , and , linda is voice is wonderful , fantastic
the headphones don not get in the way of the music .
i ordered my sony on november 24 , <NUM> sold by amazon and received them monday december 3 , <NUM> with free super shipping
the reason for my purchase of this is because of the large amount of positive reviews
my initial reaction to this headphone was "ouch" because it has a higher response to treble than my last headphoneand what it has excess in for treble , it lacks in bass
i really expected more bass , i can even crank up the lowerband of my eq and it still hasn not got enough kick to my liking
but after a few days of listening , my ears adapted
many people believe there is a headphone "burn in" but i believe this to be personal hearing adapting to the sound
the sound is okay , it is nothing , my sentry 880cd headphone ( which cost far less ) sound just as good as this ( if not better ) the reason i say "if not better" is because the sony has a quiet , but noticeable hissing sound at all times , even when there is no music playing , my sentry do not exhibit this quality
in fact , i would rather have purchased sentry 880cd again instead of this , my expectations were too high due to the reviews of others
the sony do have better isolation than the sentry , but i am not worried if others hear my music
the clamping force is not as tight as desired or expected , many of the reviews claim it is too tight
this was another factor in why i made my purchase , i wanted tight headphones because the tighter they are , the better they sound
this headphone slopes down and the band rests uncomfortably on the top of my head
i am not completely disappointed in this purchase , the sony headphone does sound good , but it is not as other exaggerated reviews would have you believe .
very good sound and base
relatively comfortable but do tend to squish my head after a while , only real complaint is they bleed sound
you ever sat net to someone that had their headphones not blaring , but still a bit loud and you could really hear them clearly ? yeah , i don not like that either
i have owned other big headphones like this that did a good job of sealing in the music so that everyone around them didn not have to listen to it too
these don not do that
the sound is great for me , but my wife complains all the time that they are disturbing her
other than that , good headphones for the price .
after many headphones i found these and they sound wonderful ! the frequency response of <NUM> hz - <NUM> khz ! unless you are going to spend many hundreds more for studio monitor headphones , don not hesitate purchasing these ! if purchasing for a very discerning ear these sound as good or better than the bose line that costs twice as much
bottom line is -- these do not suck ! but months later ,
now it has a buzz in the right ear and i am f___ed !
have tried jvc and others but sony is the best for home recording studio and other uses including watching shows
bought these head phones for my wife
she uses them when she flies , they fold up nice and they have better sound quality than the ones i have that are a lot more expensive
next ones i buy will be the sony is
i have had these headphones for six months and have been very pleased with my investment
i use them at work and they are very comfortable and the sound is of very high quality , much better than the earbuds i was using before
the included carrying case is another bonus , as is the folding design which makes these headphones portable enough to take on a plane .
the classic sony headphones that i got back in 1988--held together with duct tape , string and super glue--finally fell apart after <NUM> years of use--and countless ear pad replacements
i used other brands and sony models over the years and nothing came close to this--uncolored , accurate sound and especially its tight--not exaggerated--bass response
until i discovered the , which i have heard has been around almost as long as the
the only difference is that the is more comfortable as it completely encloses my ears ( the pads were smaller and rested on my ears , not around them )
this is an excellent value for the money .
i have always had a pair of headphones , usually purchased at best buy or something similar
i used to think price= quality
turns out in the audio universe , that just isn not true
these headphones are really great for the price , and even for a $150 pair of headphones
look , bottom line is : these are marvelous headphones
but connected to your laptop or other digital source , you will be missing out on so much audio quality
everything either needs to be analog , or you need a semi usb dac
do some research , because given the proper signals , these headphones will really blow your mind
and take all these reviews with a grain of salt
one reviewer might be basing their review on what they sound like on an ipod and another might be reviewing on a $10k audiophile setup .
i love music and demand great sound quality in my headphones
with that said
the monitor headphones are the stuff of legend
they have been making these babies for well over a decade , and as far as i know their quality has always stayed true
they have stood the test of time , and will give you the most "bang for buck" compared to any other model
and when you see how these are packaged , you will see that sony still has much pride in their product
there are so many reasons why i think these headphones are a true "classic" , but i don not want to what thousands ( if not millions ) have already said about these through the years
if you are in the market for great monitor headphones ( for a very reasonable price ) , don not hesitate to buy these
you won not be disappointed
pros : -amazing and balanced what you are getting , these headphones are truly a great value
-long cord <NUM> foot cord
-large headphone adapter included
-great build quality , they should last you for many years
and even then , you will probably only need to change the ear pads
cons : -none ( except that i wish they were indestructible
but that is not gonna happen ( and unrealistic : )
i have had other headphones around this price range in the past but they did not come close to how great this set of cans sound
i did my research and just wanted for this baby to go on sale and i wasn not left hanging
the sound is sharp and clear and just enough bass for me
i am not really into how the beats headphone are so overpowering when it comes to bass but that is just me
if you want to hear all the detail in the music at a reasonable price this will not disappoint : ) ! i once had bad headphones but now i hear ! taking this to church .
note : these headphones are in every way the same as the is , headphones for studio work
even the replacement part # is are exactly the same
so this review is for either one ( i bought both )
anyone who has been listening to music on normal street headphones will be blown away by these
the first thing you notice is how soft and comfortable they are to wear - the earcups surround your ears , leaving no pressure on the ears themselves
then , when the music starts , you notice : 1 ) background noise is blocked out2 ) bass is full and punchy , not muddy , boomy , or distorted3 ) every detail shines through4 ) the music is loud for the given volume settinghere are my comments on these four aspects : 1 ) background noise is blocked outbecause these headphones surround your ears and are "closed back , " they really do diminish outside noise
it is nothing like the bose active headphones , though - these ones just turn down the volume on outside noise rather than pulling the plug on it
this is on purpose - many headphone designers feel that active noise cancellation discolors the sound too much
2 ) bass is full and punchy , not muddy , boomy , or distortedthe drivers are big on these , and the ccaw coils let them draw power when they need it without getting muddy
if you do hear distortion , it is probably that your player can not dish up enough power , so try switching to a good amp
my portable cd players works fine though , and i hear ipods do too
3 ) every detail shines throughthese headphones are really detailed , meaning they reproduce high mids and trebles well
you will probably hear things you have never heard before like breaths , guitar fretboard noises , and string instruments
however , this makes you feel like you are right in the middle of everything , and it can get tiring after an hour or two
4 ) the music is loud for the given volume settingthe impedance on these is lower than most headphones , which means that for a given voltage these will draw more current and hence sound louder
however , power is power , and your battery only has so much of it
so these don not necessarily extend battery life , they just give you more options for how quickly to use it
for comparison , i also own the sennheiser hd 201 , 280pro , and 595
all are more soothing ( less bright ) while retaining the detail
the 201 is don not match the bass or noise dampening of the v6 is
the 280pro is don not have quite the same bass ( still great ! ) , are much less comfortable , but block noise better and sound sweeter
the 595 is are superior to the v6 is in every way ( bass accuracy , sweetness , comfort ) except that they intentionally don not block out noise at all and require a good amp to sound their best
( plus they cost almost twice as much as the v6 is
) in summary , you'd be hard pressed to find a better price/performance/comfort balance than the v6 is
try the hd 201 is first for classical or instrumental music ( they only cost $20 , so trust me , try them ! ) , but if you want noise dampening and/or punchy bass , don not hesitate to grab a pair of these .
i did very well this past christmas season
i added thesennheiser sony to my collection of headphones
i intended to keep both because i was going to use them differently
i got the sennheiser mainly for movies and the for music
unfortunately , i had to send one of them back
pros : - high quality build- folds compactly- fairly comfortable- out of this world frequency range- nice bass- love the coiled cord- includes carry pouchcons : - highs were harsh for mefirst off , i burned in both sets of headphones for about <NUM> straight days
i then spent about <NUM> hours comparing both headphones with a variety of sources
my intention wasn not to eliminate one but just to compare them since they were both nice headphones
right away i noticed that the bass response on the was much better
listening to rap , techno , trance , and synthpop was much more fun on the than on the
after a couple of hours , i started to notice i was turning the volume down on the because it was causing discomfort
however , i realized that it wasn not the volume , but that the highs in some of the music i was listening to were just harsh
too harsh
the is more than likely reproducing the highs accurately , but the is that some music was just too fatiguing to listen to
red hot chili peppers just killed me ! if i hadn not been comparing them to the i may not have noticed it
i think i am in the minority of users who have an intolerance to those higher frequencies
i was disappointed to have to send them back
by the way , my source material were lame vbr encoded mp3 is , some flac encoded music files , and dvd movies
on the flip side , i felt that the actual physical comfort of the headband and ear cups were quite reasonable
the pressure was not nearly as intense as thesennheiser pro
the coiled cord , compact folding , carry pouch , and durability were all things i found to be very positive
i am not saying that the sony will be harsh for everyone
i believe i actually have a heightened sensitivity to higher frequencies for some reason so it might just be me
but if you get them and feel your ear drums ache , you may be experiencing the same issue i did
a vast majority of users who have purchased them seem to have great success with them
in fact , i recommend everyone at least try them
they are an amazing deal on amazon for legendary cans .
i use this to listen to music on my mp3 player at work
the sound is good but after about an hour my ears begin to hurt and i have to take it off .
i tried many different headphones looking for flat response and detailed sound
i also did not want to pay hundreds of dollars
these are the one
these excel from low to high frequencies
bass is full but not overwhelming
highs are exceptionally detailed
mids are just right
i can listen to the music for hours now without fatigue
one will not find such high quality headphones for this price
other sony slightly cheaper studio headphones ( ) are terrible
more expensive are not better
these are just right .
did research on headphones and have a few friends who are audiophiles ( dj is , gamer audiophiles and musicians )
about this reviewers references
been listening to music since 1983
have had my share of ear accessories - aiwa , sony , koss , sennhieser , random studio recording headphones ( no idea what they were ) and would say these is are good , but not great
sound clarity is definitely it is strength
everyone is going to have a personal opinion and mine is that these cans can be listened to for hours
i am shocked to have read that folks thought these were too bassy
i am on the other side of the fence
i think however i am all for basslines woven in with highs
i suggest if anyone wants to test these cans should try their test on various media to get more out of their experience with these headphones
so far they really can tell a poor mp3 over a larger audio file on itunes
these are going to be used for personal enjoyment not for a professional studio
i may try these cans on my dj friends equipment , but really don not want to take them anywhere but home
yet these are transportable
about the comfort= my ears are small
they are about <NUM> inches in height and 1
5 in width and fit right into the ear cushions
i can not hear a thing outside nor inside my room
they do get a little warm , but not an uncomfortable type of heat
more like these things are growing on your head ! snug fit definitely
still new
durability= yes these are questions i would have liked to have known before purchasing headphones
i was hoping that the two elbows that hold the cans themselves would be solid steel or metal
to my dismay they are those plastic ( break this and you got to buy a new one ) elbows
i wouldn not mind finding a good pair of headphones that had a metal elbow that would hold them
that is usually where they break/or get the wire pulled
hey there is an idea for a headphone maker ! headphones that last
but would probably be less business for them
( they'd have my money and my friends )
yes so just like many headphones if you sit on these flush
you will probably break that part of the headphone
haven not tried it yet though and not wanting to
in the end i am quite pleased with these headphones
i guess the only coupe de grace would be durability/bass
i would still like to test these headphones on dj equipment and other formats
*just picked up some problems on the selling point of these headphones given the impedance rating on these phones they should sound good on my itunes : ( was listening to deadmau5 with the track strobe and the highs start to crack and pop
now i am starting to get a better feel for these headphones
they sound good for ( rock ) sound tested van halen 1984
i guess for the price you get something good not amazing
listening now
and not getting that tingly feeling you get when you are *embraced* by the mids *touched* by the highs and *rocked* by the bass
i think these are good for an overall good experience
nothing mind/body altering .
finding the right set of headphones to suit my taste for soundboard monitoring has been an issue
until now
these are the real deal
the only point i give these four stars instead of the full five is the cord
it is long and somewhat bulky , but manageable
the sound reproduction , particularly at the bass end , is surprisingly good and the overall fit is perfect
don not bother looking further
i have done it and tried most of them
i'd put these up against anything else , even more expensive brands , on the market .
i have had dozens of headphones , these work well with my ipod
i will leave sonic reviews to others , but i do not like booming and distorted bass , such as with the extremely overpriced ( imo ) beats headphones
the v6 seems to be a good value with fairly flat response and reasonable sensitivity
i have a large head and these are comfortable to me
sound isolation is good , much better than i thought it would be given the comfort and size
after reading about the pad wear , i will try periodic cleaning with a vinyl conditioner
i ordered these with a coiled cord which is a heavier than a straight cord , so pay attention when ordering if cord type is important to you .
i have a lot of headphones
and have had for many years
i have these , and love them
these are , clinical , precise sounding cans
they are hot on your ears
they are harsh
they are good for mixing recordings because they consolidate a lot of listening experiences
when you are mixing music , you need to listen on a variety of sources , sources you expect your music to be heard on : ipod earbuds , car stereos , am radios , disco sound systems etc
these are great because they relentlessly show detail
if your mix sounds good on these things , it will sound good on anything
but if you are looking for a comfortable , moving listening experience ; check out grado
audiophile quality , rich and beautiful
recordings mixed with these sony is will sound spectacular on grados
these are an incredible tool , but they are built for a purpose , and it is work , not pleasure .
there is not much to say here others haven not said , these are just fantastic and comfortable headphones
if you want emphasized bass or crackling highs - especially in noisy places like outdoors and on public transit - these might sound too flat for you - you are going to want some mtx ix1 is or something like that
if you prefer a softer , natural sound or if you are doing production work these are probably what you want
they will last you a long time in a studio or bedroom , too .
packaging is a little excessive but it does give the headphones a luxury feel
the headphones themselves are very comfortable even with the pleather
they are actually really compact compared to many cans at this price
lows , mids and highs are all excellent for under $100
the build quality is nothing less than superb as expected , doesn not feel plasticy or vulnerable to breakage at all
need time to break in these new cans but i can say that these are similar to the hd280s but the sony is are more comfortable and less costly
i recommend these to anyone looking for affordable headphones for music or monitoring in general .
best headphones on earth
i actually confused some of the sounds on the records i was listening to for real sounds in my room
xd the bass really comes out and its so rich and distinct
it really had made me fall deeper in love with music .
headphones exist to provide a provide listening experience - so as not to blast other is with your music ( or whatever ) and to isolate the environment
i have had several headphones over the years - the koss pro4a , sony mdr v150 , and some miscellaneous types
the koss pro4a finally wore out , and i figured i would try something lighter
the mdr v150 was a good choice , comfortable , lightweight , and good fidelity ( at least to my aging , hearing ) and aged gracefully if not well
the problems with the liner are well documented
however , my son grabbed them to wear when playing his online games and that was that
so , i went shopping for a new pair and decided to try the mdr v6
i am impressed
some reviewers consider them uncomfortably tight , but i am fine , and i have a "large head"
the cushions are reasonable soft and provide good isolation
it is the fidelity that blows me away for the price
the volume is good ( again , too many years on a carrier deck , i "need" volume ) and the bass is smooth and rich without being obnoxious
the higher frequencies are clear and sharp without abrasive characteristics
the adapter is the "smaller" 1/8" that is common to ipads , phones , notebooks , etc
a bonus is a nice 1/4" jack that doesn not just snap onto the smaller one but screws on tight ! nice quality touch
for the price ? excellent , and highly recommended .
i bought the headphone a week ago
and i have no luck with headphones , these seem very good
costly but is a great value
here are my thoughts
they look well made
the weight for the headphones is not as heavy as some may think
i use them for hours daily
i even walk around with them
being a women i don , t like heavy weight
so i find the weight good
the ear pads are very soft , also replaceable which you can not do with some
the fit is an over the ear
they look kind of big , but don not let that fool you
i am a women with small ears , they fit nicely
the cord is one sided , and thick
it also looks like a phone cord
i wish the cord was replaceable
i don not think i will need to replace them
the length of the cord is longer than others
that is great for me because my cd player is on my book case near the couch
the sound is great even with the volume at low sound
you don not need to put it that loud
the balance of the sound is well balanced
can fold them , which is great for draws
lets talk pouches soft well made with a drew string
i like pouches in my opinion
i hope this helps you make up your mind .
it is like a classic headphone but can beat many modern day headphone in terms of sound reproduction and quality
definitely won not regret owning this
when i bought this , i thought i had bought a set of gold plated diamond necklace
sony packaged it like it was a limited edition
i paid <NUM> bucks for headphones that were mediocre before and this is only around 75
very solid sound and great for monitoring , i thought about needing a <NUM> dollar pair of sennheiser but a colleague said you won not get more out of a more expensive set than this
i am not sure what is the difference between this and mdr7506 but i can only image how awesome the professional ones are though .
i am very pleased with the sound of these headphones
it is detailed and across the frequency range
i am happy to listen for extended periods and the headphones are comfortable
i cannot comment on thumping deep bass because i listen to the wrong kind of music for that
i bought a pair of these a couple of years ago but gave them to a family member
this newer pair cost much less but sound every bit as good
on sound quality alone i would give these five stars but the construction is a bit concerning
pulling on the extenders to lower the earcups feels as if it is pulling the headband apart
the old pair extended smoothly
i don not know if quality has gone down or i just got a wonky pair
since i can leave the earcups extended this is not an ongoing problem but it does raise questions about overall quality
i haven not had any other similar issues so far .
extended frequency response for harmonics , thus sound is crystal clear
also bass response is excellent
very comfortable on the head and ears
this phone does not eliminate ambient noise , nor is it designed to do so .
i bought these for a trifecta purpose
1 ) i can use them while recording music
2 ) i can have cans to listen to my mp3 is3 ) so i can enjoy music again
i am not single anymore ( haven not been for a long time ) , and i don not have the that i used to have in order to listen to music at the volume i enjoyed
nor do i drive my car often enough to be able to listen to much more than a few tracks at a time
then my wife complains if i turn my music up past <NUM> on the volume knob
so i pretty much fell out of the music listening loop over the years
music was , and has been a huge part of my life , and i miss it
now , with these cans , i can lock myself in the basement , sit back , and be that dude on the old memorex packaging being blown away in his chair
these things make music sound so much better than it does coming through any loudspeaker
it is like you are right there with it
these aren not even on the same playing field as earbuds , and those expensive dre beats headphones suck compared to these
after comparing the two , i am so glad i didn not waste my money on beats
i will likely buy a few more pairs of these so i don not have to keep transferring them from one device to the next
and i took the advice of other reviewers and picked up thebeyerdynamic edt <NUM> velour padded earcushions for dt250 , dt280 , sony mdr7506 and v6 headphones ( pair ) to replace the ones that came on it
they are much more comfortable and don not cause your ears to sweat nearly as bad as the ones that come on it
if you are a true music aficionado , you will not regret this purchase .
been kind of interested in adding another set of headphones to my collection
mostly used for mostly music playback and some pc gaming
these headphones fit the bill
at their price , how can you beat these ? sound , these have a great sound
just so you know where i am coming from
i have been married to my bose triport headphones that i bought years ago
i paid $150 for those
compared to those , soundwise , they are about even , with the edge going to the sturdier sony is
the sound is excellent at the bottom , mid is and highs
i found the sound level to be even accross the sound field
very flat
but flat in a good way , as these can produce very good lows , mids and highs
not any one particular range dominated , which is perfect
construction is without a doubt , excellent
these things will take a beating
the cushions are comfortable
i have a huge head and i found these to be fine
not tight or uncomfortable
the only ding against this fine headset is the cord , it is long , thick and heavy
not very portable
i wish there was a way to mod the wiring to put something like what bose uses on these , then these would be perfect
i believe a different version of this headset has a more portable wire
5mm jack is not compatible with iphone is bumper case
carrying case is thick and cheap looking
overall , if you are a headset aficionado , i think you will appreciate these
a fine headset to add to the collection
pass on the beats by dre , save money and enjoy
*update*10/21/2013*the cord was really getting to me , so i cut it
big mistake
i was hoping to just splice the wiring and make the wire shorter , and manageable
when i went to cut the cord and strip the ends , i found these very thin wires
i believe they were l channel , r channel and ground
well , when i went to touch the ends together and test , i got no audio whatsoever
great , just killed a perfectly good set of headphones
well , long story short , i was able to solder the ends together , insulate the solder with electrical tape and fix the headphones
worked like a charm
i wouldn not recommend this to anyone
i lucked out
i thought this set was cooked for sure .
i bought a pair for record monitoring about <NUM> years ago and liked them so much i bought a second set before they were discontinued
the retailer i got them from is long gone but these babies are still available
not that i need them , they still function perfectly
i keep one on the computer and one on the stereo
they are not the best sounding cans i have heard as i own a set of stax
but they are the best monitors i have ever used
a little hot/harsh above 10khz but that is what you need to hear what you have got
they can smell any clipping
the stax earpads have gotten flaky but these sony is have aged well
they get dropped , ripped off my head etc
all the time , no problem
they fold up compactly in a travel pouch and plug into anything
i wear them for hours comfortably
i have other sonys , sennheisers , beyers and others that i can not listen to anymore because of these
there is no better value that i know of .
it sounds great
and over the last year , it has proven to be quite sturdy
easy to store in the bag that it comes with
i highly recommend it .
wonderful ! the specs looked great
after receipt , i tried them out with my <NUM> star itunes playlist
i had been using etymotics ear buds , but wanted a longer cord and an over the ear style
the sony beat them hand downs
i had originally ordered a pair of ( $148
00 )
to me , the muffled the bass sounds a bit and didn not give me the crisp highs that i had expected , or was used to
i returned those and ordered the sony ( about $85 ) , and couldn not be happier ! better than the etymotic ear buds - solid bass - but not too much
, and nice crisp highs
also , they are a bit more comfortable than the , and a lot less expensive ! the sony is are solid !
i was going to buy the professional alternative of these headphones so before i did i read some of the reviews and there wasn not much of a difference i believe the only difference was the 1/4 plug is gold plated and this one isn not but these headphones are worth every penny
i use it for video editing and they rock hard .
i just got these recently after reading all the reviews here
the others aren not lying , these headphones are unbelievable
i find them extremely comfortable , and don not think they feel heavy like others have said
the build quality is top notch , and feel like they could last for the years that others' have
as far as the sound goes , they seem to do better with real music than fake
basically , if you are listening to classical , jazz , acoustic , vocals or classic rock , i can not imagine anything could ever reproduce sound better
i have listened to led zeppelin for <NUM> years , and now i am , hearing ( and feeling ) subtle sounds i never heard before
they will almost bring you to tears as you go back and listen to your favorite albums
where they seem to fail is with fake music , such as rap , hip hop , or anything else created with synthesizers or computers
if that sort of is your thing , you may be better off with the dre headphones
if real music is what you listen to , you absolutely have to buy these .
great sound and comfortable ! i have not experienced the discomfort many other reviewers mentioned as a con in their reviews
i use these with my high definition audio recorder , and can hear every detail
i have also used them to listen to music , and have found them to be quite a pleasure ! if i were to nitpick , i'd say the coiled cord is a bit cumbersome due to its weight
if you are using this with a small device , such as i do with my zoom h1 audio recorder , it will definitely need some care so it doesn not tip the device over or pull it off a table
not a huge problem and not really a con for me .
first of all , i was nearly dissuaded from purchasing these because of complaints about tightness
anyone who says these are tight probably never wore real headphones before
depending on how pampered your ears are you may need more padding but that is it
sound quality is superior and the fact these fold up so nicely make them excellent if you travel
as long as sony makes these i doubt i will buy another brand/model .
i bought these headphones on amazon for the great price of <NUM> bucks and let me tell you it was money well spent
they sound fantastic and feel very comfortable after watching <NUM> hour long movies or listening to long music sessions while working around the house
keep in mind , like most headphones , they require time to &<HASHTAG> ; burn in
&<HASHTAG> ; out of the box the highs sounded off and bass was mediocre
after a week of listening the headphones sound fantastic and keep getting better
remember this when purchasing these headphones
if you can get them for the <NUM> bucks i got them , then i promise you will enjoy the sound and the price !
love these have done well and still have great sound and quality just as good as good if not better then the hip hop brands
sony mdr series headphones been always one of the best , no wonder many professional studios are using it ! i use mine to play guitar at late and don not bother the neighbors
once in a while the ear pad has to be replaced [b001dfx2oc
an excellent product , the audio quality is commensurate with the cost
its design is perfect and comfortable
i have used products like this headset pro2 and for less money obtiee very similar performance
excellent , i recommend it .
i bought these on sale and after seeing the reviews
i don not do a whole much with these headphones but plug them into my iphone to listen to podcasts and the weird music i have collected
it is hard to describe but these headphones are comfortable and they don not seem to get in the way at all , aurally
headphones are so personal that i can not say these will be the best for you
they are not perfect for me ; the cord pulls my iphone off the table for example
but they are nice enough that they are what i use every day .
would have been <NUM> stars but after hours of wearing , my ears are sore
do i have big ears ? maybe
the cushion is a half inch thick until you put them on
then it compresses down to about 3/8 , which makes the speaker portion press against my ears
the sound is quite good , not the best i have heard , but suits my purpose , which is for editing music
the bass is a little heavy for my taste , but more closely resembles what i hear from my room speakers
highs are decent
the response seems reasonably flat - at least i can hear almost all of the highs , except the really high highs such as the hiss from the electronics
quite lite and comfortable , but not as comfortable as i would like them to be .
i wasn not looking to spend too much so i found these
the reviews were great and they are comparable to beats and other high end sets
only knock is that the coil isn not detachable and the bass isn not that great
but overall , after a month of use , it is the best one i have ever had .
great buy ! i read previous recommendations and made up my mind to get this great headphones
they are as described
sounds crispy and i think it gets better as you use them
very good isolation , despite you can hear when somebody talks which is a good thing
frequency response is amazing and seem to be well built too
excelent ratio .
these v6 is sound amazing
especially for the price
i purchased them &<HASHTAG> ; used&<HASHTAG> ; from amazon warehouse and i can not tell them from a brand new pair
i compared the sound quality against a set of $300 bose qc 15 is that i have for my many business trips and the sony is sound significantly better
of course , they are not noise cancelling , so i will still use the qc15 for trips
but for listening around the house or at the office , hands down i would use the v6s .
i have owned many pairs of head phones over the years and listened to many more
these offer simply the best sound experience that i have had
i have even listened with more costly sony headphones and found them lacking in comparison to these
i have been able to rediscover some of my music with these wonderful head phones
they are so good that many members of my family have also recently bought them
if you love to really hear your music , do yourself a favor and buy a pair of these , but make sure you read the warnings - they can cause damage to credit card magnetic strips and mechanical devices with small springs ( e
watches ) .
the venerable v6 is a steal at $70
i also own a pair of mdr7506 is and the sound is indistinguishable between them
hooked up to home or studio gear they sound great
and it is true you can order inexpensive replacement ear pads from sony is parts division
the sennheiser hd280 is the main competitor to the v6/mdr7506
connected to studio/home equipment , the hd280 may be a better choice for classical , jazz and acoustic music
the mids sound a little cleaner than the v6
having said that the hd280 is larger than the v6 and requires more power for equal loudness and bass
ipods and mp3 players just don not have enough juice to power the sennheiser ; the v6 is more efficient .
just wow
i have owned these for a year now and i must say i am so glad i bought them
when i bought these i was on a budget of under $100 and now that i have more funds i have been shopping around for something better , but everything i have listened to is simply inferior in one aspect or another
either they are uncomfortable or don not sound as well , but either way i gave up and i have gladly decided to stick with my
the attenuation from ambient sounds is incredible , especially in a car/plane
you can have the volume either as low as it goes or pumped up and these headphones deliver without missing a beat
only pitfall is my head gets a little warm and my hair gets tussled but i am ok with it .
the pro is1
very comfortable and lightweight2
used with an amp the volume gets real loud3
coil cable to move around real easy4
very portable and easy to fold upthe con is1
these headphones are trash when it comes to durabilty2
they have no bass at all3
the highs get real loud that it becomes very uncomfortablesummary : if you like loud music with no bass at all then these are your headphones
( buyer be ware speakers are known to blow out with the slightes bit of bass ) it just so happen to me the day i got the pair from amazon my right speaker blew out within 1hr
i packed it up and returned it all with in the same day
don not waste your money and just buy something else .
arrived reasonably quick
this headphone is from the last generation ( )
it has better quality than many current more expensive models by different manufacturers
good sound quality for the money
however , i have a big head and feel the headphone clamming on my head overly tight just like several other reviewers have commented
my son loves it and it doesn not bother him
he is using it all the time .
terrific headphones with great balance
nice bass , lots of detail , maybe slightly ( very slightly ) rolled off in the treble
this is the shure of headphones
a big plus : very efficient so can be used with lower output devices ( think ipods and cd players with headphone jacks )
i have compared the sony is to the and i think it is close but they don not sound alike
but then there is the comfort issue : you wear the sony is long enough and your ears are going to get sweaty ; otherwise i find the sony is very comfortable
if you don not like the ear pads , b&h apparently offers velour ear pad replacements ( from pearlstone ) that might help
btw , i own two of these headphones : one from ~15+ years ago and a recent pair
they sound identical .
i use these every day at work
great sound
much better build and sound quality than any other pair i have owned
tried to talk the kid into these instead of the silly beats but couldn not do it
sound quality is a distant second to looks apparently
could only be better by allowing for easy cord removal
i almost never need a 3m coiled cord
i will probably follow one of the excellent diy cord replacements online .
it says a lot about a product these days when it is been on the market for more than <NUM> years
with today is year product cycle , old technology becomes outdated and obsolete fast , forcing many once revered products into retirement
this is extremely impressive when you consider the company that makes these headphones is sony ; a huge multinational corporation that rarely has any one product out for more than <NUM> years
so why have they stuck around for so long ? simple ; because they are amazing
no set of headphones in this price class ( and several above ) can hope to come close to how balanced these things are
all frequencies are represented accurately ; just as they were recorded and without any coloration
bass lines aren not bloated mess is like in many modern headphones , mid range frequencies are as they should be ; in existence , and treble is highly detailed without scraping at your ears
though not as detailed as a set of $500 headphones , these are not anywhere close to that
hovering around $65 most days , these cans provide incredible value
don not take this the wrong way ; they are not amazing for what they are , they are amazing period
buy these for editing , sound stage monitoring , or neutral listening and you won not be disappointed
though if you buy these because you want "street cred" and bass that makes your heart beat backwards , you clearly didn not understand a word i said .
sony headphones are by far the best headphones out there for the money
i listened to audio technica and dr
dre is beats headphones and in my opinion the sony cans sound the best
the dynamic range is great
good bass , clarity at the same time
i use mine with "cmoy headphone amplifier" and it shines truly with it
i am using it from last <NUM> yrs and i enjoyed it all these years
i am happy to see sony still makes them
i will definitely order one more headphones for my family members
pros : excellent sound stage , great highs and lows
very comfortable headphonesexcellent build quality , very sturdy using excellent materialsheadphone coil is protected by metal shieldspring type wire - very usefulfrequency range of headphones is comparable or better than much high end expensive headphonesno distortions , no loose connection problems , no rust after using for <NUM> yrs ( replaced ear pads <NUM> timesin <NUM> yrs ) love the matte black finish on the headphonescons : none noticed
i use these headphones several times a week on my computer to listen to music
fantastic sound quality
one of the best audio purchases i have ever made and i have three surround systems in my home
very pleased indeed
would buy again !
ok , let me start off by saying that i did a lot of research on plenty of headphones before i chose to buy the sony headphones
i was going to choose the sennheiser <NUM> until there were several reviews saying that it doesn not go well with an ipod
anyways these headphones are really good
i am currently into eight hours of breaking it in
when i first opened these headphones and plugged it into my computer and i was extremely disappointed
the sound quality was almost exactly the same as my cheap $15 headphone and the sound was ridiculously bright ( high treble )
i was ready to return this product until i thought to myself i needed to break it in first to really judge it
after six hours of breaking it in the sound quality changed dramatically
i mean i thought i was listening to a new pair of headphones
right now it is sounding great and i am currently at eight hours of breaking it in
there is still bright sound but not has horrid as when i first plugged it in
people that have these headphones are suggesting thirty hours
i really recommand that everyone breaks in these headphones first before listening to it but i don not recommand this product for people who don not like bright sound and people that are looking to sugar coat their current music .
i was curious how this headphones did in comparison with <NUM> and they sound exactly identical , i did plug both on a 3
5 splitter adapter so i can hear both with same song and same equalization , they do sound exactly the same , so now i dont thing the burning in process really exist , my <NUM> have easy <NUM> hrs of use and and i cant hear any difference , so , if you cant decide which ones to by between these <NUM> just go for the cheaper ones , they also look the same but for some reason they feel cheaper than 7506 , thanks
after doing a lot of research , and trying all headphones i could get my ears on ; this choice was exactly what i was looking for
i found most popular brands just had too much bass
the headphones rely on the true sounds , that were actually recorded , or meant to be reproduced
i do have to wear hearing aids- so hearing with these headphones is such a pleasure , while listening to music
i also really enjoy the comfort , because i plug them into my stereo system for late nite t
needless to say i'am very pleased with the sony headphones
the bass and tones are excellent for me
from 60 is and up rock to country , and a little jazz , these things are powerful- but don not overpower the music
i waited a few days before doing a review , i have thrown every thing i have at these headphones , and am very pleased
i recommend them to you ! they were very well packaged , and in a funky display box-- pretty cool
happy customer , thanks amazon !
thank you sony
this is a very good headphone
comfortable on the ears and not so heavy to bring around .
i purchased these to replace an old pair of v600 is that had served me well for nearly a decade , and the quality of sound out of these is as close to perfection as i have ever heard
it has crisp , clear highs , and the bass is unbelievable
i am hearing bass notes that i have never heard before in a pair of headphones , and what is amazing is that the bass doesn not overwhelm or muddy the rest of the sound
i tested on my laptop and my ipod and set the eq to flat on both , and the sound is near perfectly balanced : no muddy bass , weak midtones or tinny highs , just beautiful sound that makes listening to music almost a new experience
the phones themselves seem very well constructed and the cups fit comfortably over the ear
the padding on the cups is thinner than on past models , which make the phones slightly more sleek on the head , but they are every bit as comfortable as the older v600 is that i replaced
the headphone cord extends down from the left ear cup and is coiled and plenty long enough to attach to your laptop or personal music player
it comes with a 3
5mm to 1/4" adapter so that you can plug it into headphone jacks on stereos
if you are going to use it on a home stereo , i'd recommend getting a ' extension cord for it , unless of course you can sit close to your receiver
these are an incredible deal in my opinion
i can not imagine much better sound at any price .
i have used the since <NUM> when i was just a kid
i have loved using them everyday since the day i first heard a cd play on them
the sound is like liquid sxx in my ear canal
i seriously had to spend some quality time with the lights out and my cd player and these hps
i still have my original hps and they sound just like the virgin hps i unwrapped the day i first heard digital music
i use the mdr7506 on my digi <NUM> for pro tools sessions , but they sound exactly like these imo
i am emotionally attached to these hps though
the mdr7506 is what is in the studio for anyone
i keep these for me
i bought these in a special gold edition wrapped in red satin pillow with a special screw on 1/4" adapter
i lost the adapter and the satin pillow hit the file 13
i bought another 1/4" adapter from a local store for my midi keyboard
i like the ability for these hps to be worn with one ear folded up so you can listen to yourself sing and listen to your audio at the same time
]+++edit dec <NUM> *-sony dot com is selling these today and they have better response than <NUM> hp , its v6 and <NUM> [
]-sweetwater dot com sells the beyerdynamic dt250 earpads that are better than the sony ones after a few years
the sony earpads will flake after a year or so
the beyer ones fit the sony v6 and 7506[
can not go wrong with these headphones , the price is right and the sound is very good
i am no audiophile , and these aren not audiophile priced headphones , but they work great for gaming and music sounds crisp and clear
i would say give these a try if you are looking for reasonably priced headphones that sound good .
buy them
light , comfortable and great sound
i will say that i was disappointed at first
initially they are too ( painfully ) bright , but after about <NUM> hours i was really impressed .
these headphones are fantastic
not only do they produce incredibly full and clear sound , but they are also lightweight and extremely comfortable
they fit firmly on your head , cancelling outside noice marvelously without giving the feel that your trapped in a vice
my dad bought a pair of the koss pro4aa titaniums and i have to say that this sony pair blows those away
while the sound quality is similarly great , the koss is are about 5x as heavy ! they really put a dent in your head and start to hurt your ears if you wear them for much more than an hour
the sony is are much more comfortable and much more lightweight and portable
i definetely recommend these
you won not be disappointed .
these sounded great and felt really good for extended wearing
it provides awesome sound isolation
the bass improved after the headphones were broken in after a few days
the v6 provides a natural sound unlike alot of phones that are bass heavy
the thing i did not like was the fact that the hinge that connected the headband to the ear cup is made of plastic and the small wiring leading out of the headband for each ear cup seems like it could get snagged and torn
other than than , these sound great
the downside is that the hinge is plastic
i hope they will not snap after prolong use .
bought these to replace a pair of bose headphones that broke apart after <NUM> years
i didn not want to spend a ton of cash on a higher end so after reading reviews ; i settled on these
i have to say , these are better than the $179 bose headphones i bought
everything is clear and crisp
bass isn not too overwhelming
i mostly use these to listen to my ipod , but it is almost got me wanting to set up a home studio and get started on some recording to really test them out
only drawback is the exposed wires
i am afraid that if i adjust these it might pinch
i will just have to be careful .
i can not say enough nice things about these headphones
you will not be disappointed
i have had a pair for nearly <NUM> years and they are still killing it
buy a pair now , or spend three times as much for essentially the same headphone .
i bought these headphones to replace my sony headphones , which are the cheapest pieces of plastic garbage i have ever seen
the v6 is produce a beautiful sound and allowed me to hear details in my music i never knew existed
i have got a audio setup worth about $2000 and these headphones sound better
these headphones are ridiculous
they are worth about $300 by my standards
it also appears they are built to last , as most of the parts are robust plastic or metal instead sony is normal cheap sh*
update : the little wires that run to the speakers are unable to withstand an encounter with a housecat
i strongly recommend not leaving these headphones along with your carniverous pets .
i was looking for some beats by dre headphones , but i did not have enough money to cash out $300 for some
i ended up buying the is for about $80
they are worth every single penny , and i think they sound better than the beats
i like to listen a lot of rock , alternative , and electronic
john mayer , justin nozuka , santana sound so good through these headphones
if you like listening to mainstream , the bass in these headphones will go down low without distortion
listening to daft punk and justice through these headphones made me love them even more
if you love listening to an array of music genres , your ears definitely be satisfied for a lifetime with these headphones
i also use these headphones as studio monitors when i record my own music .
i have owned two pairs of these since 1988
they were around $100 in <NUM> dollars and well worth the cost then
they lasted about <NUM> years before abuse finally cracked them
i went without nice headphones for several years , i am very happy that they still sell this model , they are compact , have great range bass to high and put any of my other headphones to shame
they are by far the best value in headphones , kudos for sony for keeping production running .
pro : great sound
fairly effective sound isolation
well built
cons : i don not find these headphones to be super comfortable for extended wear
1 ) they are tight on my head2 ) my ears are bigger than the hole , so they kind of pinch
it might be that after a while they will stretch out or relax to my head
and they will become more comfortable .
i did not know that sony made headphones of this quality , and give this pair highest possible recommendation
whenever you see words like "professional quality" or "pro " or "studio monitors" in the product description , run in the other direction
<PERCENT> of the time , this is simply exaggeration by an ad copyist who has never been in a recording studio
the v6 is a happy exception , and certainly worth the price of admission
monitors ? a genuine one must allow you to hear every last detail of the sound/voice/music : --the sound of the reverb of the radio studio--whether or not the announcer is using a pop and/or wind filter--how far from the mike the announcer is mouth is--what brand of mike is being used ( for music , neumann u87 or akg have a distinctive sound ) --mike placement in relation to a large chorus and/or symphony orchestra--acoustics/ of the performance venue--be able to hear individual tracks in a overdubyes , yesthere are not many headphones that meet these requirements , but the v6 certainly qualifies with flying colors , regardless of the cost
my old standard , akg k340 electrostatic/dynamic , has long since given up the ghost , but these are a more than adequate substitution ( besides , the k340 was a wee bit bright , but the v6 is much more flat )
this is both good and bad : really good recordings will sound even better , but bad recordings will sound even worse
ergonomicsthe plug is solid aluminum rather than black plastic , but is straight rather than bent
the cord is long , and half of it is coiled , so you get plenty of running room , but is no good for uses
despite the conventional design , it is one of the lightest and most comfortable i have ever used
many hours of usage is not unreasonable for this pair
the pads are large and surround your entire ear but are certainly not isolating
they are rather soft , and the material will wear out with time , so expect to replace them at some point ( and the replacement pads ain not cheap ) .
just like the title of my review says , i have had these since <NUM> and haven not had a single issue with them
sony knew they hit the ball out the park with this model and have kept them in stock
what you get is a high quality set of head phones with a very durable coiled cord and a very convenient bag that has come with me to trips around europe and back
while they are not the best for noise canceling for when flying ( not really intended to ) they do make up with great sound , a punchy bass , balanced mids and highs and all without the need for an amp , but don not get me wrong , using an amp is also a great option
the specs are : impedance : <NUM> ohmsdriver unit : 40mmsensitivity ( db ) : 106db/mwfrequency response : 5hz - 30 , 000hzhope this helps .
i love these headphones
the sound is superb
bass , treble , etc
it is all super good
in the airplane they are just about noise canceling
the only beef i have with these is they are a little loose on the head
i will take it though
i have used them with a droid phone , and i don not think they are quite loud enough sometimes
however , that is just the phones issue i bet .
there has been a degeneration of sony products
these headphones are cheaply made ( wiring is not concealed ) and are not as comfortable and well made as my sony headphones that are more than <NUM> years old
fortunately sony still sells replacement earphone covers for the good headphones that it formerly made .
got these earphone today and was impressed by the quality of the materials
i was a little worried , however , by the exposed wires connecting each side of the earphones
these earphones sound very good with solid bass and overall clarity
they did seem a little harsh on the high side , but were very comfortable to wear
while i like the overall sound of these earphones , they are not quite as smooth as my jvc earphones , which i consider the very best i have ever heard .
bought for my nephew as i have a pair that was purchased in <NUM> and after replacing the pads are still wonderful
he really likes them and i rarely see him without them now ! ( he is 15 ) he is using them with his iphone , ipad , and notebook
hopefully he will get 35+ years out of them .
i purchased these after looking into the difference between these and the sony mdr7506 , there is none except these do not have the gold plated jacks
they sound great ! i have many other sets of headphones and these are by far the best
i thought the others where great until i heard stuff through the v6s
you will hear things in your music you never heard before
they block out noise and are very comfortable on my big head , yet they fold down for easy travel .
i have owned these headphones for somewhere between <NUM> and <NUM> years and they sound as good today as the day i bought them
i have not treated them the best
i toss them in the drawer , i toss them in a basket
sometimes i fold them up and sometimes i don not
i don not know what some other reviewers have done to their headphones but mine have been rode hard and put away wet , and still look and sound terrific
they sound great cranked way up or very soft
i use them for my ipod , my stereo , my computer and my tv
the only thing that has gone wrong is the coiled cord has stretched over time and is a bit awkward to deal with
i can live with it
i have owned some bose triports and have listened to many others while browsing around audio stores and these mdr v6 is sound as good or better than anything else i have tried
i recently gave my son the boses' and i kept the sony mdr v6s'
they are made with quality materials , fit well , don not get hot or heavy and sound excellent
the bass is accurate , full but not overdone
the mids and highs are crisp and balanced
by the way , in comparison to others in the market today they are cheap
i am guessing mine will last several more years but just in case i am going to snatch up another bargain set and stash them away for the day the music dies
i have enjoyed these headphones every time i put them on and in my opinion you can not go wrong with the sony mdr v6 !
purchased this set for my father who has difficulty hearing
he likes to listen to music on an mp3 player while mowing the lawn
these work well , he says that they sound great and block out a lot of background noise
he is very please with them .
i used to make music at home and have used various models of headphones at night for quiet mixing
i have also used some for gaming and movie watching
the are the best i have used so far
i am not claiming to be a pro
these might be mediocre overall if i were able to compare them other 'cans' in the headphone world
all i know is that these sound healthy
i can hear a deep level of bass
it doesn not rumble your ears but you can hear very low frequencies
for example , if i pop on some dj magic mike ( that miami bass music crud ) , i can hear all the low end sounds for the most part
deep rich sound overall
these days i mostly use these for late night movie watching while my son is asleep
they do the job very well for me
my only miniscule complaint is the fatigue on my outer ear from the cans pushing in against them
i can get a couple hours in before it becomes irritating , sometimes <NUM> hours or more if i have them placed perfectly over my ears
this is normal though and all headphones do this .
audio is crisp and clear and design is very comfortable
even more comfortable when paired with the beyerdynamic edt <NUM> velour padded earcushions .
i have a hard time finding headphones that fit nicely and feel comfortable for long periods of time - due to my large head size
these headphones not only sound terriffic but they are also very comfortable
super soft covers on each ear piece and the stretchy cord is a nice touch too
this set feels good in your hands , and on your head , the quality is obvious and its a well made product
i used these on a long set of flights recently and was able to watch many hours of movies and tv shows before i started to feel any discomfort while wearing them
and that is really saying something ! i highly recommend these for general use , even if you have a large head .
for the price , you can not beat these
i am an audio nut
these headphones are balanced
very versatile
great quality and comfortable fit
can not see a headphone beating these out ( for the price )
they sound like $300+ headphones .
i have owned two pair of these headphones over the years
this pair was a gift for my grandson
there was a problem with them when i received them
the insulation on the cable was pulling away at the earphones
i returned them and amazon immediately replaced them
if i ever need another pair this is what i will buy again .
most comfortable headphones i have worn in a long time
night and day from my previous set
sure , the sound quality is awesome , that much i expected
but the comfort
i can see myself wearing these for hours without a thought
anyone else who says these are uncomfortable either has a really large head and doesn not know it , or simply isn not telling us
these have room to spare on my head and my head isn not small
i"m 6' 220lbs
either way , these are awesome
definitely would recommend these to anyone .
i first got a hold of my first pair of sony mdr v6 monitor series headphones in the late 90 is
oddly enough , it cost about the same back then as it does today
the sound was phenomenal
you actually had to lift the headphone to make sure the bass was not coming from the room
not that the base was unusually loud , it was just that is sounded so real
these were studio quality headphones that were actually used in studios
you would see these sony headphones in practically every music video that was shot in a studio
fast forward about <NUM> years , the headphone craze starts up
every audio company want to break into the headphone market
sony adds newer models of headphone that still can not live up to the mdr v6 is , i decided that i wanted to replace the sony mdr v6 headphones that had gotten lost long ago
used mdr v6 headphones were selling for over $150 if you could find them at all
so i did a little research and found out that although there was a demand for these headsets , sony had discontinued the mdr v6 line anyway
luckily , the reason that i could not find the v6 is was the when the headphones were first , they sold out immediately
although i had to wait months , i finally got my replacement sony mdr v6 is
so what did i get for all this waiting ? i received a true studio tested headset that has a sound so clear that you wonder whether its actually coming from your headset
unlike some other headphones , the v6 is did not artificially increase the treble or base
these sony is were designed to be studio reference headphones which required them to have a flat , unmodified sound
in my opinion , these headphones are classics that arguably outperform newer and more expensive headphones .
i bought these as a gift because i had bought these very same headphones for myself years ago
i love them .
maybe nit senhiesers but they are very good phone for the $
this is the second pair i have owned in <NUM> years
the first were destroyed by a new puppy in the house
not dog proof !
beautiful sound
very clear highs and solid bass
i also have sony phones
i love sony products
very dependable quality .
i produce digitally composed music
these are an absolute for anyone that makes computer music , just go ahead and add these quality , comfortable , crisp sounding headphones to your studio
no need to look around at other brands or cheaper/more expensive ones , these are the headphones you are looking for
trust me
check out my old tunes at
bunch of new songs droppin' in january
my soundcloud will improve now that i have these headphones .
of course , any audio situation is a matter of personal taste--but--i suggest anyone try these who wants to hear what headphones can be
they have the best bass--the purest highs and they are comfortable for listening over a long period
be aware that these will go very loud--far more than most--so be wary when you listen a lot
i have had a pair for around <NUM> years--and i have replaced the ear pads--and they have worked fine always
i paid $100 when i bought them--around $210 in today is dollars
this price is exceptional
i was going to buy another pair--but saw no need
professionals use them
i have had many other good ones--but--these are in a class by themselves
you will not be disappointed
another good choice is the sennheiser hd202--my second favorite pair and a bargain
and i hope all of you realize that "ear buds"--are just wrong--useful only in unusual circumstances .
didn not buy these on amazon , but had to come and pay my respects
i noticed after buying these that a lot of radio programs would use these headphones .
these really can not be beat by anything else in this price range
they are quite comfortable ( thinking about replacing the vinyl ear cushions with velour ones as the vinyl ones make my ears a bit sweaty after extended use
i won not go into audio quality as there are plenty of reviews that do that
the build quality is superb
the coiled cable is sturdy , and the plug weighs almost as much as my cell phone ! the included adapter screws on very securely
i ordered a few headphones when i was deciding on a pair and these beat out the xb500 as well as comparable sennheiser and sure headphones .
i have a collection of headphones , but now by far this is my favorite , very comfortable in long use
highly recommended
on the go they are lightly and when not in use , they fit in the pocket of my regular jacket
i love them , the sound is crystal clear
and for that price nobody can beat them .
first of all i am not a musician , director or studio engineer ( just a really big music and entertainment fan ) and have tried several headphones and actually owned about <NUM> headphones in the same price range as the v6 ( and a lot of much cheaper ones ) in the past and while the ones i liked were great in their own right , the sony mdr v6s are the best sounding headphones i have ever listened to
the sound is very even and natural yet extremely detailed and not at all "lifeless" or "boring" to listen to
they have a really deep , smooth , rich yet accurate bass sound and have crystal clear treble and mid range
overall , there may be other headphones that cost twice as much that sound better but for the price when it comes to sound , the sony mdr v6s sound absolutely flawless for the money and they are a true bargain
these headphones are not only beautiful to listen to and come beautifully packaged they are also very comfortable and durable
i have had these headphones for <NUM> years and haven not even had to replace the ear pads yet and i can listen to these headphones for hours without taking a break
the v6s are very similar to the 7506s in sound and appearance but i think the v6s are actually clearer and even more detailed to my ears
it can debated by people that they sound the same but to my ears i can honestly say the v6s sound better to my ears and they have an even longer cord than the 7506s so buying a headphone extension cord is not necessary
overall , i would definitely recommend the v6 to anyone looking for a great sounding , durable , accurate and affordable set of headphones .
i purchased my sony headphones in my very early teens ( if not earlier ) after reading a review in stereo review ( i believe )
since then , they have gotten tons of use and i have seen them everywhere
i have gone through <NUM> or <NUM> cords over the years and they are finally falling apart
i wanted another pair but settled ( ha ! ) on mdrv600 is , which are very muddy - all mids
they are going back today to best buy and i am getting a new set of v6 is from here -- i can not believe sony has kept this model alive so long
these are incredible 'phones
trust me
for alternatives , get the following : <URL> comparable of its range .
love them , sound fantastic , easy to ware
i am a programmer and i ware them for about <NUM> hours a day every workday while listing to music
i had these headphones for about <NUM> years and i have to say the sound quality is excellent
the fact that they are still looking good means they are well made
if you have a chance to buy them then don not hesitate because you will not get a similar value for the price anywhere
about two years ago i ordered the replacement pads from sony and just installed them yesterday , and now the headphones look like new
as for the fit , they are comfortable but tight and after a number of hours i can see why some people complain about sore ears
there is a slight difference in the older headphones according to the specs because the older ones used a samarian cobalt magnet and these don not so maybe the cobalt was not as easy to obtain any more
now they are almost the same as the mdr7506 but with a better audio range so why pay double the price ? now my only decision is whether to buy another pair when i have a fine working one .
i first bought these to go with a discman many years ago
i review lots of classical music cds here at amazon and if i listened to them all via loudspeakers it would probably drive my wife nuts
so i often use these headphones instead
another reason i do that is that i find that the sound they deliver is a clear analog of the sound i get from high quality loudspeakers
i find i can wear them comfortably for as long as i am listening -- and sometimes that is hours at a time -- and never have the urge , as i do with other headphones , to take them off because of physical or aural discomfort
more recently i got an ipod -- my kids went together for my birthday and bought me the fanciest ipod available ! -- and i find that these headphones are much more comfortable and acoustically accurate than those darn earbuds that come with the ipod
i do notice that these headphones apparently have greater impedance than the earbuds ; that is , the volume control has to be turned up a bit to get the same volume as delivered by the earbud
but the improvement in auditory accuracy and comfort is more than worth it
thumbs up on this classic set of headphones
scott morrison
i have had these headphones on at a reasonable volume , and i cannot hear people directly in front of me talking to me
the sound quality is excellent
i want an extra pair because my husband keeps stealing mine .
i have bought many headphones and found that these sound more professional than my most expensive headphones
these cans are legendary in the audio world
with a flat frequency response , they are very eq friendly
these headphones will definitely tell you the quality of your music so it is best to have your mp3 is with the highest bitrate possible , or use flac whenever you can
i have read that some people are disappointed with the sound , it is not the headphones ! it is your music source and the equipment used
it is best that you have some kind of headphone amplifier or good audio gear to drive them as ipods and the like do not have the power to properly push them
these are my go to headphones when i want to have a good listening experience
as a last note , sony has quietly retired the is after nearly <NUM> years of service ! i ordered an extra pair just in case and i also have the as well but prefer the old tried and true
get them while you can and beware of !
these headphones are great , when buying these headphones don not expect major hardcore bass because that is not what they are meant for , they are evened out and have a very clear pleasant sound balancing all of the sounds in music , videos , etc .
a relative bargain when compared to &<HASHTAG> ; fashion lifestyle&<HASHTAG> ; headphones
the sony 'phones were always known for being quite good and these out perform many costlier headphones
the ear pads will fall apart after a year or two , so expect to have to replace them
this happens to most headphones with this type of ear pad
this isn not unique to sony .
i am very happy with this headphones , however i can not take them to my office
i just enjoy them in my bed and feel in a concert
great seller , beautiful sony package .
i have been a headphone fanatic for thirty years and have owned and used a variety of headphones over those years , to include stax , sennheiser and
the sony mdrv6 excells as the best value of any headphone that i have ever owned
they are especially good at producing deep bass , and the overall balance is excellent
the sound quality is all in all comparable to other headphones that cost considerably more
the mdrv6 is especially for travel due to the collapsible design , and for noisy environments or for quiet environments such as a library where the sound emitted by headphones would distract others
the mdrv6 is not quite as comfortable as some other headphones , but the comfort can be improved enormously by replacing the pads with the velour pads from beyerdynamic
the pads that come on the mdrv6 have a cover , and significant additional discomfort is caused by the way that the thin foam cover is glued to the pad around the inner circumference of the pad , which prevents the top and back of your ear from slipping into the space between the pad and the face of the headphone
this forces the pad to rest on the back of the ear , which compresses the ear and eventually becomes uncomfortable
i read on a web forum where several people had replaced the pads ( which eventually come apart ) with a velour pad made by beyerdynamic , and after i did this replacement on my one pair that had a damaged pad , the increase in comfort was so great that i immediately did the other pair
the thin cover can be glued down to the headphone face if needed to hold it in place , which then allows the top and rear of your ear to naturally slide under the inner circumference of the pad , which is considerably more comfortable
i can recommend this trivial modification without reservation to anyone who owns these headphones
even if you don not replace the pads with the beyerdynamic velour pads , i suggest removing the pads anyway , then carefully separating the thin cover from the pad , and glueing the cover directly to the headphone surface .
i have owned sony is headphones for years ; the sound quality was okay , but they always hurt my ears and weren not at all comfortable
then the ear pads stared to deteriorate and leave black specks on my ears and face
instead of spending too much money for replacement pads i decided it was time to buy a new set of headphones
after doing some research and reading reviews i bought my first set of monitor series headphones
i am happy that i did
the sound is better than my old ones and they are very comfortable on my ears
also , the price was reasonable
from the reviews , i realize not everybody agrees on quality and comfort
all i can do is express my own experience
i am very satisfied with these and recommend them
i understand that these pads will deteriorate , also
you'd think that sony could make pads that won not fall apart after a few years use
update : these ear pads are starting to deteriorate and get loose , also
sony ! , please improve your quality control and make ear pads that last ! i can buy replacements , but i shouldn not have to
i never did find replacement pads anywhere for the headphones that weren not more expensive than buying new headphones
i bought my first pair of headphones back in 1990
the v6s were awesome then , and are still awesome today
sony came out with the 'phones later , and when i wore out my original 'phones , i tried those out
what a waste of money
the units are much clearer , have lots punchier bass , and just sound "in your face"
the sound muffled and weak in comparison
i am glad sony listened to their customers and the v6s after they were discontinued
they also sell the identical headphones under a "professional" model number
you will pay about $30 more for the 7506s , and they do have a longer warranty ( 3 years as opposed to 1 ) and fancy jacks , but my original v6s lasted about <NUM> years before needing to be replaced , and who cares what color the jacks are ? i highly recommend these 'phones to anyone who needs accurate , tight , clear sounding 'phones
if you want the longer warranty and silly gold colored jacks , buy the costlier "professional" ones
either way , you will enjoy awesome sound
pros : clear highs , punchy basshigh sensitivity - <NUM> db at 1mwcomes with a soft drawstring carrying casecomes with a 1/8" to 1/4" trs plug adaptercons : can be a little uncomfortable over extended periods of use ( over an hour for me ) , but you can find replacement pads for the earpads that afford a little more comfort
search amazon for "sony 211566803"
should be around $12 or so .
fit perfectly on my head - i am 5'1&<HASHTAG> ; , so some headphones are rather loose because the headband is too big
great noise cancelation without giving me a headache
great clear sound
possibly the best headphone i have ever bought
the build quality is great , one complain the ear cushion can ware off easily but i third party replacements are available .
i have owned every kind of audio device from koss electrostatics to convenience store earbuds , and i have finally found the perfect mix of style , comfort , value , and sonic accuracy
it is difficult to believe ( unless you have used these sony is yourself ) that any headphones can look so cool , be so comfortable , cost so little ( relatively ) , and sound so good
i listen to jazz , rock , reggae , classical , show tunes - pretty much anything , and no musical genre is shortchanged
while high and middle notes are reproduced with exceptional quality and accuracy , it is absolutely amazing how well bass notes are rendered
listening to the double low c at the beginning of "also sprach zarathustra" is an experience not to be missed , and is especially remarkable because of the absolute lack of the doubling usually encountered with small diameter ( relatively ) acoustic transducers
buy 'em - you will be glad you did
update : december 30 , 2012love these headphones , and it looks like i always will , but i have found a way to make them even better
here is a review i wrote on improving the sony headphones : i bought these ear cushionsbeyerdynamic edt <NUM> velour padded earcushions for dt250 , dt280 , sony mdr7506 and v6 headphones ( pair ) for my sony phones and could not be happier
the sony cushions are certainly good , in fact are a cut well above average , but the beyerdynamic is are still a clear step above even them
wearing the sony is with the original cushions for more than an hour left my ears a bit sore , especially at the very top and bottom where they were slightly pinched
the beyerdynamics , however , allow me to wear the mdr is indefinitely with zero discomfort
i don not know if it is the slightly larger size of these cushions , or the material they are made from , but it is like wearing air - you simply don not notice their physical presence
and there is an additional benefit : for whatever reason , probably because of the superior seal these cushions make against your head , bass frequencies are enhanced over the already excellent bass produced by the sony is
in fact , to make the expression of bass consistent with mid and high frequencies i found using an equalizer helpful
the lowered requirement for the headphone amp to produce bass frequencies allows it to reserve energy it can then use to support a wider , and more accurate , dynamic range
a situation all because of better ear cushions ! in an earlier review i read about how to install the beyerdynamic ear cushions
nevertheless , i approached the job with more than a little trepidation , worried that i'd end up with a pretty but pile of junk
not to worry though , a good tug removed the originals and installing the new was a pretty obvious procedure
glad i did it ! and yes , at least for the sony headphones , toss the plastic flanges that come in the package
they might be needed for some other headphone model , but not the sony is .
not only are these headphones great to listen to , they fit nice and snug
great sounding phones like these are hard to find at a good price
they are very comfortable and they filter out noise around you
the sound is clear and accurate
i heard sound from my music i never heard before
thats why i give the sony , a best buy <NUM> star rating .
as the good reviews state , these are classics
great value and sound great
if you want full sound and don not want to pay a ton for the popular headphones of the day , these fit the bill perfectly
amazon was selling at an unbelievable price , so i jumped on them
i got them because i a don not really like earbuds , preferring headphone style as they stay put and sound better as a result
that said , i returned these because the pleather material sony uses on the parts that touch one is ear get very warm and cause the ears to sweat
it ended up making my whole head feel warm
i guess i am a hothead , but i don not know how people say they can wear them for <NUM> hours comfortably
i could have gone to the trouble of buying the $24 beyerdynamic velour earpad replacements others suggested which are more comfortable and won not eventually flake off , but really had no interest in upgrading something brand new
sony should charge a bit more and make it right the first time
for now , i will continue to use the no longer made sony sports headphones i have had for <NUM> years which work for me much better than earbuds , stay cool and allow me to run or commute while wearing them all while sounding better than earbuds , though not quite as good as these did
when they break , i will cry since the style is no longer available and have to hope someone makes something reasonably priced , comfortable and full sounding at that point
look , most people rave about these so don not let this review discourage you , as all headphones of this style may be hot and uncomfortable and may just not work for me
the incrementally better sound is not worth the discomfort in my case
mine went back within <NUM> hours and i lost the return shipping cost , but at least amazon graciously took the return .
i bought mine in <NUM> without trying them on , they just looked nice back then
well , they are still going strong
i had to replace the ear pads , but that was the best thing i could have done since i replaced them with the velour pads
they are so comfortable
these are also awesome for plane trips because they seem to block out most of the noise
i don not really know if that was the case with the stock pads
i hope the new ones are still as good as the old ones .
in reading the reviews here , i noticed there were a few reviewers that said these headphones were too tight around their heads
this left me concerned about whether or not i should buy these or continue looking
after all , they didn not include any head measurements that i could use to compare my own head with
on the other hand , most reviewers said the sound quality was excellent
so i went ahead and ordered a pair
i received them today , and i am happy to report these headphones are very comfortable on my head
( my head measurement = <NUM> 3/4 inches which is <NUM> centimeters ) the headphones stay firmly on my head even when i turn my head
i don not hear any type of distortion when i turn my head
i wear glasses and the headphones are still comfortable on my ears
without any stretching , the cord is long enough to go down to the floor and then around to the back of my pc which sits on the floor below my desk
the cord will stretch out longer
the cord doesn not pull on the headphones or provide any type of discomfort
the sound quality is excellent as stated by the other reviewers
in fact , i have the volume turned almost all the way down on itunes and i can still hear the music very clearly
i would recommend these headphones .
these headphones are great , but i could have saved $90 if i just kept using my , panasonic stereo headphones , instead of looking for "a better" pair of headphones to buy
also , these sony headphones have the heavy coil wire which gets to be a little uncomfortable
the heavy coil wire makes it feel more tense as if the headphones are being pulled off your ears .
* this review has been updated as of 7/23/2013
updated info at the end of the original review
*i actually purchased these for field listening while recording commercial video and have used them occasionally as backups for enjoying my music on my laptop , ipod and android phone
the sound is very good , with solid bass response and crisp highs , but they actually hurt my ears ( physically , not aurally ) if i leave them on too long
which usually equates in to anything more than <NUM> minutes
for the record , my hat size is a <NUM> 1/4 , so i would say the overall size of my head is average
a person with a larger head size may find even more discomfort in a shorter amount of wear time
in the past i had used the less expensive sony monitor headphones found in department stores
the sound was adequate , but i felt i wanted something more professional
these are definitely a step up from the sony department store models , but same uncomfortable ear fitment
the bonus to these is they fold up nice and compact for better storage , so i don not have to worry so much about breaking them
they also come with an inexpensive little carrying pouch for added protection
bottom line : sound great , but uncomfortable for periods of long listening
* 7/23/2013 update *these did not last long
the left side stopped working and i had to throw these out
i paid too much for a pair of uncomfortable headphones that didn not even last as long as the cheaper studio monitors i have bought at target
it was enough for me to know i am done with sony headphones .
i love these headphones
it gives me a nice clear , crisp sound when listening to music and videos
my boyfriend didn not know what the difference was between good headphones and quality headphones until i let him borrow these
now he won not give them back to me : ( i always go with samsung and lg for anything visual and sony for all things audio .
this was my first headphone 15years ago
a sony seller frind of my fayher gifted it to me
it was already old but i loved it
all of you can notice
this is the headphone with less <NUM> star in amazon
only <PERCENT>
yes ihave had sennheiser
they are less confy
good and really neutral
sound is great and i know from experience that the speakers will last years
the cord is strong
its comfortable
i could sleep wih them on
i connected it to my component and damn
my ears vibrated
if taken care of they will las years
can be modded and repaired
i use them with my phone
best headphone dor the price
this is a neutral headphone
it reproduces things just like they were recorded
if you want trebles or lots of basd you will have to do it with the equalizer
its great since i listen to all kinds of music .
i tried these out before burning them in and a burn in was enough for me to notice a difference in the overall responsiveness
i use these to my mixes and to help balance out my recordings in addition to regular studio monitors
they also work well in a slightly noisy environment when you need to monitor something .
this is simply put the best headphone that i have ever own
i have never heard anything that sound remotely as good as this headphone
i am hearing subtle sounds and beat from my music that i never heard before
and the price couldn not be better and the cool packaging was a nice topping
my only regret is not knowing about this class of headphone sooner .
the sony produces superb sound across the entire spectrum
unlike some of the other reviewers , i do not find the lows stronger or weaker than the and highs
the set is comfortable , and the cups insulates noises well ( not to compare to headphones )
all that said , i still feel that the set should cost at $15-$20 less .
i got these headphones and was extremely pleased with them
i did a lot of research before purchasing these
before continuing , some notes : -sony is no longer manufacturing this product
these headphones were designed in <NUM> and sony attempted to cancel the manufacturing of this product years ago , but upon popular request , were forced to remake the product
they then cancelled them again and are no longer on the sony site
-there are really replicas afoot
if you purchase this product , verify that they are a sony authorized retailer
-you need a powerful audio source to get good sound out of them
do not plan to hook these up to your handheld device and be pleased
okay , now my review
this is an overall very comfortable headphone
the weight is good and they feel like a very product
i returned them due to their lack of power
after listening to the <NUM> from the same source , i realized just how weak these are
don not google &<HASHTAG> ; vs
&<HASHTAG> ; you will spiral into a debate between people who are simply loyal to the original product ( v6 ) vs people who say they are the same exact thing
they are not the same thing
some claim the magnets in the <NUM> are &<HASHTAG> ; stronger , &<HASHTAG> ; to which i cannot testify
the only thing i can say with certainty is that i heard subtleties from the <NUM> that i did not hear with the v6
audio quality of the v6 : low mids are strong , while the high mids are not crisp
sound quiet , while the really deep bass sounds as it should , but not strong
highs sound strong throughout
save your time and money and get the <NUM> if you are debating between the 2 .
i have a small recording studio and bought these for mixing phones after reading some reviews
these have a great clear sound , not too bottom heavy like some headphones can be
they can hurt alittle after you wear them for awhile but over all these are really great headphones for everything from mixing to just listening to your favorite tunes .
having never owned ( or even listened to ) a pair of headphones , i was astonished by the clarity and detail afforded by this model
it demonstrates the inadequacy of the several players i have - the best sound source seems to be had by playing cds on a dvd player through a lcd television
they also allowed me to hear previously inaudible features of heretofore familiar recordings
the players' breathing and scuffling in the quiet passages of a string quartet were clearly discernable ( as they would be if the players were giving a private concert in my living room )
i bought these primarily based on the reviews on amazon - so this one is only adding to the existing positive chorus
the sole design flaw seems to be the headband , that only touches the head at one point
they seem to be comfortable anyway , and to be fair , this is a traditional headphone design
the split headband with soft fabric surmounting the head , and a separate spring above , exemplified by the bang and olufsen form 1 , the rca whr 120 , and others , may be more comfortable over long periods
however , recently in a local record store , i noticed that the headphones provided for customers to sample the records before purchase were this very model .
after having my headphones for six months i think i can finally give a review of them
pro - flat , accurate sound from low to high that gets smoother the more i use them
reasonably light weight for their size
generally well built except for the exposed wire leading to each earpiece
the low impedence allows me to use the v6 with my retro portable cd players ( one of them only uses <NUM> aa battery ) with good sound volume
no need at all for an amplifier
con - when putting the headphones on , my fingers sometimes get caught in the exposed wires leading to each can
i have learned that when one of my fingers can not let go of the headphones after putting them on , to stop and gently pull whichever finger is caught out of the wire loop lest i rip the wire out of the can
the pleather earpads that come with the v6s tended to make my ears really hot and sweaty in summer weather
i replaced them with a pair of beyerdynamic velour padded earcushions for the from b&h ; photo
big improvement in comfort and sound quality , especially comfort
the beyerdynamic pads are cooler and more transparent to sound than the pleather pads that come with the v6s
i should have ordered the beyerdynamic pads at the same time i ordered the v6 phones and replaced the original pads immediately
when i get my backup i am going to do just that
summary - if your taste in sound tends towards flat , uncolored accuracy ( as does mine ) and you don not want to spend loads of $ , then the is the one
bassheads probably should look elsewhere .
the empirical evidence published at headroom
com , which is now hard to find , showed these phones to be among the very best ever produced
their start , in the 1980 is , began when they were picked as &<HASHTAG> ; best buy&<HASHTAG> ; in &<HASHTAG> ; consumer reports
they were also the best of the many tested as having the best sound at any price ( at that time )
they remain so , despite a few reviews , even by audiophiles , who are reviewing their own hearing , or are playing to their client audience with advertising bias ; they remain today among the <NUM> ten headphones at any price
my first pair lasted <NUM> years
i bought a new pair ( surely they had deteriorated in sound ) to place back in my headphone stable ; this includes akg <NUM> and beyerdynamic at present
the sony is did not deteriorate in sound quality
only the inexpensive ear pads are a nuisance , as they are on every brand that uses pleather ; small potatoes
some confuse the clean extremely low bass , with exaggerated bass
i call it &<HASHTAG> ; subwoofer bass in a headphone
you will not be disappointed or need to look any further folks
one of the true bargains in hi -fi history .
i wear my sony mdr headphones at work in an office
usually they get about hours of use a day
i must include the fact that i wear eye glasses
i am totally satisfied with these
they sound great and the comfort level is 10/10 even with glasses
my head is a size <NUM> 1/4 around and my ears are about normal size
recommended !
i agree with other reviewers about the sound quality and build quality etc
excellent product on its own
but this is not for someone who loves bass like me
i ended up buying another extra bass sony xb700 which is much more bassy .
i am very happy with these headphones
for under <NUM> bucks you get sound quality equal to the bargain sets around twice the price .
my primary purpose when purchasing this headphone is to drown out loud background noise
secondary is music listening ( i am not a music buff )
wear it for about <NUM> hours each time and it is still comfortable when i take it off
i work in a very loud place ( computer data center room ) and this device drowns out the noise really well ! i will leave the &<HASHTAG> ; how well the sound is delivered&<HASHTAG> ; out of my review as there are numerous other reviews that can convey that message much better .
i had this phone for more than <NUM> years now
the pads started to fall apart about <NUM> years ago , but the sound is still good as new
in the past <NUM> years , i spent lots money on many mp3 players dvd players and many of them are broken or outdated now , but i kept using this phone so it was money well spent because it was used on daily base
i tried other phones which did not cost lots of money but were very good quality products like koss , unlike the most is a closed type phone which helps to block noise like running ac in a office
i compared it to a senheiser , i liked the sound of more
in my opinion , phone has a deeper yet clean bass , blocks noise better but i prefer a better bass .
i did not buy these here on amazon due to discount i had with sony , but purchase was made due to the high reviews given on this product
let me say that amazon reviewers never steered me wrong and they sure didn not on these either , for this price you can not beat the quality of sound these give out
the sound is so clean and natural and like the <NUM> you hear sounds in even older music that you never heard before
the <NUM> is a great set of headphones itself but i prefer these i think the bass on the v6 is better and for the price why not get both they still cheaper combined than beats and bose
i was in awe of the studio beats i bought them in december but since sold it due to the bleed coming out where everyone else around you can hear your music
back in december these v6 was out of stock everywhere and now i know why but since late april and early may they are available everywhere but not cheaper than amazon unless you can get a discount from someone else
contrary on some reviews where they say the build quality or the comfort level is sub par i don not see that at all these are very well built and i don not baby them at all due to the price
i can wear these for hours and times i don not want to take these off due to the great sound i am getting from my iphone 4s or ipod classic
when i listen to my iphone and the tune in radio app it just sounds awesome
i even got a spare pearlstone pads just in case the original wears out or come off but no signs of that yet
i do like the fact that when i pump the volume on these no one else can hear my music it has a great seal on your ears
when i saw that these headphones been around for <NUM> plus years i knew these must be great and it didn not disappoint you cannot go wrong buying these just look at all the great reviews and if you look at the bad one you see why others just jump with comments on those guys but beware they are a lot fakes around so buy from sony authorized sellers only .
very rich sound for the price
have owned this product for several years and the sound is spot on but the earpads flaked badly and fall off repeatedly which is a pain in the ass to deal with
see many similar complaints .
first of all , i'd like to say , the packaging is very nifty with the red velvet
now , second , the sound
at first , when i first tried it , it sounded weird on my film soundtracks because i wasn not used to it , but after getting used to it i wondered what the heck i had been listening to with my last headphones
these new headphones make songs from a month ago sound too good ! third , the the ease of use is flawless , except sometimes when you take them off and put them back on , you might have to spread the earcups out as they like to be together
fourthly is the comfort
i was thinking of giving this a four star , but decided not to
the reason why , was because the coil
yes the coil
that long cord
if you late it hang down next to your chair , it sometimes causes to send a beat back to your headphones
not a sound , but you feel it , and it is annoying-- so i try to keep my wire on top of the desk
i might coil it up later when i feel like it
other than that , it is perfect , except it does kind of block out sound so , if someone is calling you , forget it >
&lt ; loledit after over a year of use : the sound quality is great ! sometimes the wire can get in the way because of its weight , but if you keep it on the desk , which is really easy to do , there is no problem
the earpads are comfortable too
but there is a problem with this device
despite its pros , the earpads aren not very strong , and replacements are even worse , and harder to put on
the earpads that came with the device lasted <NUM> months
this is good
however , replacement pads i bought didn not last long at all , months usually ( one or both earpads )
i have had to buy like <NUM> replacement pads
i admit , i might not be putting them on exactly right , which i intend to take every precaution when buying a deluxe version pair , but still , the internal gradual ripping of the material covering the inner foam just keeps happening
like i said , when i get the deluxe pair , i will try my best to put it on perfectly , but i am still hoping for the best .
these headphones sound amazingly good and are even better considering i got them for around $70 ( refurbished )
they fit very well in my head and i can use them for hours
they also fold and come with a pretty nice carrying bag
would definitely purchase again !
i initially bought two cheaper headphones ( panasonic & jvc ) believing that i would be wasting money if i bought a more expensive set
boy was i wrong
i picked these up in the black friday week of deals for 39
99 and could not believe what i was listening too
my music never sounded this good through my mbd integrated audio before
the bass was clean , accurate and not overpowering , the mids were clear and the highs were crisp without being overly bright
the sound isolation is also pretty good
i will admit at times it feels like a clamp on my head and i currently have it pulled down where i can see <NUM> notches on either side to fit
the ear cups also might not fit around people with big ears but by no means are these small
the headphones come with a 3
5mm adapter , a leatherette carrying pouch and is equipped with a thick coiled cable
as good as these headphones are , i do not know how they will survive on the go ( it can be folded into a more "portable" size but they label them as a studio monitor headphone and they have wires that are exposed around the headband ) if i knew they were this good , i would have bought more of them and sooner .
its a decent headphone for the priceamazing soundfor indoor use is perfect but for outdoor like using with ipod not to good the cable is to long and curly
just wow
i am a <NUM> yr old with a crazy obsession with sound and music
audiophile ? maybe
these headphones are so perfect in every way
the sound is so crisp , clear and clean , the design is awesome and simple and the materials are very high quality
they are so comfortable even for my sensitive ears
the bass is just absolutely perfect , not choppy or muddy at all
forget the beats , forget the souls by ludacris , save yourself the money and get higher quality at half the price
there is no surprise that these have been so widely used for almost <NUM> years
the included adapter is perfect because it allows me to use these cans in my iphone and home audio system which is also <PERCENT> sony , i just love their audio hardware .
my last set mdr v5 , broke at the screw ; scotch tape made them usable again , but finally i had to give the cups not thrifty ! these seem to be i really abuse thinking of adding the scotch tape reinforce them ; the sound is as about as good as it how can i know ? is there a law of diminishing returns for headphones sound ? as i go over the latest offerings , i can see none that rate higher than at 4
5 starsi try to 'weight' the negative reviews # of <NUM> stars + # of <NUM> stars + half the # of <NUM> stars total , vshalf the # of <NUM> and all of <HASHTAG> , 5s ; a model can have a 4
5 if the bottom <NUM> total are stand backi was thinking that since ive had these for 8 ? technology must have increased to make a better sounding set of hpsive noticed shocking price drops since i last visited a few months ago ; but since all i need are new earcups why not spend &lt ; $20 rather than $ ? esp in this i know when my choices are multiplied by the millions we see black friday turn into black xmasmy only question is why these did not have the gold plate plug ins ? i saved the outer larger gold plug in from the broken set , but of course the benefit might be lost since the smaller silver plug still must go in first
i really enjoy having bass back in my music
these is are excellent quality and also work well when used with my ipad .
after close to <NUM> years i broke down and got my second pair of my mdr is my first two witch i have are the best headsets you can buy
the is the same just a bit smaller and lighter for the price i am absolutely blown away $40 they should be well over $100 and i paid more than that two decades ago for my old set
you cant go wrong .
to begin , the sound on these is very detailed , and it will play your music like it is
if your music is a poorly recorded track , it will sound poorly recorded so i recommend feeding these "studio monitor headphones" the highest quality sound files you can
the bass can extend deep and low yet remain tight ( not flabby ) , the mids are well balanced and have no artificial coloration to them , and the highs are all there
i auditioned these at a store before i bought them , and preferred them to the audio technica is , grado sr60 is , sennheiser 280 is , and even some amped sennheiser hd650 is
and these sony v6 is don not need amping at all because can be easily driven by an ipod and get get really loud
i don not think these have a perfectly flat response , they are a little bass and treble heavy to my ears
i believe everyone is ears are different , and for me , i agree with the reviewers that say the treble can be harsh
and because of this , i could not crank the volume without the treble eventually becoming fatiguing
but since i still loved the sound and clarity of these , i tried to see if i could change this
i went to the craft store and bought some thin felt for a few cents , cut it to proper size and then placed it between the headphone drivers ( speakers ) and the ear pads
this cut down the harshness without changing anything else , and now i decided i will be keeping these
another modification i had to do relates to my ears
my ears are big and poke out , and these headphones were very uncomfortable because they pushed on my ears to much , since they do have some clamping force for sound isolation
i found another simple solution for this : you cut some thin strips of cloth from a and push them in the crevice under the pad that goes around your ears to give more space between your ear and the drivers , thus making them rest around your ears up against your head , and not on your ears
you don not want to shove too much material in there or you start to lose some bass and could maybe tear the ear pads if you get too crazy
just a half of an inch width by six inches long folded in half "hot dog style" worked great for me
i found i didn not need to upgrade to the beyerdynamic pads after doing this , and now these are comfortable for hours and this saved me twenty four dollars
since the headband has a metal spine through it , i was also successful in carefully bending it outward to provide less clamping force on my larger than normal head
the sound isolation on these is great , and i actually love the coiled cord which helps from keeping the cord ripped out of the headphone if it gets snagged on something
they are built very well , but i do not like the small wires exposed on the sides which i think makes them vulnerable to snag so i will have to be careful
i think these headphones are as good as you can get for $70 , if you want better you are going to have to start spending a lot more money
just make sure you buy from a refutable seller and make sure you don not buy fakes , which are out there in abundance
these headphones are great so i wrote this review- to let you know there potential and to show you how you can improve them with simple , non permanent mods if you are inclined to try them
i hope sony never stops making these .
other reviews are good
i like these because they are supposedly flat
i like my games and sound cards to do the adjusting of the sounds
good for music and games
interesting note , when my dad did research and picked a pair of these in the 80 is , he picked these also .
piece of crap , the ear pads keep coming off
i should have just bought the beats headphones by dr
dre instead .
i know it seems great to have today is portable earbuds
but you can not beat the sound quality for the dollar in sony headphones
i have the &<HASHTAG> ; old version&<HASHTAG> ; of these , loved them for the past <NUM> years
my hubby borrowed them , and wouldn not give them back ! so i ordered these for him , hoping he'd switch ( he did - yay ! )
before you order any of the &<HASHTAG> ; &<HASHTAG> ; or other headphones , check the hz
for the dollar , you won not beat these sweet phones !
i dont really want to write a long review because i am not the biggest audiophile ever
i just wanted decent headphones for a decent price
i will say these are just about worth exactly how much they cost
the sound is amazing
everything sounds amazing and it has the perfect amount of bass and treble and with minimal adjusting i am sure i could make whatever changes i wanted to make them sound better
biggest complaintthese headphones are ok to wear for an hour of use , but after that i find my ears in horrible pain
i have to adjust where they sit on my head cuz it really does hurt , i dont know why they push so hard against your head
i usually wear a hat when i listen to them because it delays them hurting for a while
otherwise , they dont like like incredible quality
for the sound they are incredible
but i wouldnt get them again cuz they hurt so much
if you are looking for comfortable listening then these might not be the bestbut they sound good and block out a bunch of sound .
i have used way more expensive headphones than these and they don not hold a candle to the sound you get with the sony mdrv6
these are classics for a reason
my dad had these same headphones back in the 80 is and they are still around competing in the market to this day
i don not know about you but i can not name too many products that stick around for <NUM> plus years
tried and true and used in professional recording studios
you can not go wrong with these
get em'
these are the best headphones in this price range by far
the bass is great ( listen to a lot of and house ) , the quiet strings ( listen to classical ) , and everything in between , honestly best for that price , last you <NUM> or more years , if you take care of them of coursesony monitor series headphones with ccaw voice coil
ok i have had this unit for a few months
at first i thought it was a revelation
the most realistic flat and detailed unit ever herd
then i realized that the mids are slightly recessed andthe highs were fatiguing after extendid listening
so as revealing as these units are , they are not the end of your journey on headphones
i myself still have them but end up using the audiotechnica es7 as the es7 is just the best
i purchased these to listen to my mp3 collection on my tablet , and they sound amazing
are comfortable , and ooze with quality , hey it is a sony .
i bought my current pair of phones about <NUM> years ago , and they still are the best sounding headphones i have heard , and they still sound as good as they did back then
to solidify my confidence in them over the years , any time i have seen any documentary or video of a rock group that showed any band members or engineers in the studio , they were always using the
if it is good enough for the pros , it is good enough for me
the amazing thing is that the price really hasn not changed much
i think i paid about $50 or $60 for mine
anyway , i guarantee these headphones will not disappoint
by the way , i noticed that amazon suggests a headphone plug adapter as a paired purchase with these
i don not know why they would do that
unless sony has changed something , these come with that
it has the standard ( home stereo system ) plug which unscrews to reveal the smaller ( portable player ) plug underneath it
i have read other reviews about amazon pairing items that don not even go together
don not assume you need it .
these headphones have great sound , are super comfortable , and do a great job blocking out outside sound
they could probably stand to have the styling upgraded though , as they look a little out of date compared to newer designs
4/29/13 update : although i am still very happy with the sound of these headphones
i am going to take off two stars because my earpads already wore out
i have had these less than a year and use them very very lightly
although there are many replacement options available , wearing out in less than a year with the light use only that i have put on them is inexcusable
now i am going to have to try and figure out sony is warranty service , not something i am looking forward to
on the plus side , i have found these to be very good for the airplane - they really do block out a lot of outside noise .
excellent sound quality and faithful reproduction , better than anything i have ever listened to
when i first got them , i to my whole collection just so i could pick out all the bits i'd missed out on before
blows away beats and bose and whatever other overpriced brands are out there
at first , these were a bit uncomfortable
i replaced the pads with some velour ones that i also bought from amazon
now , they are much more comfortable , and seem to be better at blocking out sound , both ways ( good for when you want to listen in a quiet room )
i think they look good too , they aren not bulky like some other models
nowadays , after breaking them in and the velour pads , i will occasionally fall asleep in my bed with them on , and i don not mind keeping them from when i wake up to when i go to bed ( i am a heavy music listener , if you can not tell ) i mostly listen to metal and classical , but this plays just about anything really well
i do have to mention that these headphones reproduce music perfectly , which also means less bass compared to other phones ( beats ) that intentionally inflate bass ( which in my opinion distorts music that doesn not need it )
if you have an equalizer on your audio player or computer , it is no big deal at all
when i listen to or electronic music , sometimes i jack up the bass , and these headphones can put out a good thump .
i spent a long time researching headphones
i truely appreciate quality sound , but i am cheap so i didn not want to spend a lot
well , for under $100 these headphones couldn not be any better
absolute clarity with incredible richness and punch
i love these headphones !
i have owned both and there is no comparison
first off , this is a truly great pair of headphones in the $70-$120 range
they have a very flat frequency response which means the lows , mids and highs pretty much get equal billing
this is fine for me
because they were made more for studio monitoring rather than casual listening , some might feel they are lacking at the low end , but i think they just represent the music more faithfully
if you need to adjust the bass up higher , then go for it
they can handle it , and much better than the is which produce boomy low quality bass
the low frequencies on these are much tighter and more defined
middle frequencies on these are great as well
little to no coloring , vocals come through great
middle frequencies on the 600 is are pretty awful
it is like someone turned the treble up to 11
i don not know how else to put it
the one criticism i have of these is the poor quality of the earpads
not only do little black flakes of fake leather start to come off after moderate use , but they completely came apart at the inner seam on mine , exposing the foam inside
i know i am not alone in experiencing this and quite frankly it is a little baffling why they have not addressed this issue in the 25+ years this model has been available
there are lots of options as far as replacement pads go , so despite that i would still highly recommend these on the basis of great sound quality .
i bought these to monitor vocals from a sony m10 and boom mic during amateur filming , and to double as a portable set of cans for casual listening
when they first arrived i plugged them into my soundcard and listened for about an hour
i was satisfied but not thrilled the way that so many others have been
the v6 is are legends but i didn not see what all the hype was about
i mean they sounded good for the price , but not to the degree i was anticipating
bass is very good , treble is very sparkly and bright , but the mids are unacceptably recessed , and even at times sound hidden , or veiled
treble was riddled with sibilance too , not good
now , at home i typically listen to which have incredible
furthermore i understand that the v6 is get better and better with
we shall see
at this point i was just meh about the v6 is
then i remembered what i really bought them for
i brought up some voice recordings that are stored on my pc
these cans have incredible detail
very , very analytical
i auditioned almost everything in the pro monitoring segment ( i
shure srh440 , ark 8400 , at m40fs , etc
etc )
for pure analytical work such as vocal tracking none come close except maybe the shure is which are so bass shy that they are almost a
so bottom line is if you are in the sub $100 segment for the same reasons as me then you want these
if you want just good phones for listening on a bus or in the library i'd get audio technica m40fs or m35 which are less power hungry , more comfy and have a slightly more engaging overall sound
but for a good headphone with no compromises in vocal detail and an price point these simply can not be beat , and after all these years .
great headphones
they work well with ipod , computers , stereos
basically everything
amazing sound
quite comfortable although sometimes a bit hot
highly recommend these
only downside is that they aren not nearly as stylish as many other closed headphones out there , and no noise reduction
mike , toronto , ontario
first , the sound emanating from these headphones is simply wonderful
they are not boomy , but have clean and tight bass as well as crisp highs , and everything in between sounds equally as nice
the cord coils nicely and doesn not tangle , entering the left side of the headset and with a very nice strain relief at the plug on the other end
the "funky mechanics" that i refer to are related to collapsing the headset and the adjustment of the headband
the headband adjustment will not maintain position and slips while putting on or taking off the headphones
i also find myself being ( overly ? ) careful when collapsing/expanding the headphones , but maybe that is just my paranoia considering the cost
the sound quality is without par in any headphones i have ever had and i would definitely buy another pair if these don not fall apart mechanically within the next couple of years .
i have gone through a lot of different headphones , all i have loved for different reason but in the end i decided to stick with these
they don not do anything bad in my opinion
also i'd recommend you buy the velvet ear pad is for them .
pros : great sound clear , crisp , and bass is perfect not over saturated to the point where you cant hear the music
cheap for its qualitybuild is solid and not very plasticy like othersnot tight on the head nor does it fall off from being too loosecons : i have encountered none
of course you can spend a ton of money on amps , dacs , and headphones
this pair of headphones will deliver <PERCENT> of the quality of super high end gear at about <PERCENT> of the cost
i also own the ath m50 and i'd recommend the sony ( unless you are into more bass heavy things )
the sony is are also more comfortable
they don not feel as sturdy , but they are very well built too
unconditional recommendation .
i paid upper 70s on sale a couple of months ago
i think it is <NUM> to <NUM> less now
they are worth $70 so if they have dropped in price then they are definitely worth it
sound is good for digital stereo , but won not compare to a surround sound headphone
if all you need is stereo you won not be disappointed .
if you ask my hubby i know he would say this is the best gift i ever gave him
he drives a truck and when he is getting loaded or unloaded he spends alot of time on the docks
these headphones take out a done of the back round noises so he can listed to his mp3 player or do work on the laptop !
rumor has it that these sony headphones are being ( or have already been ) discontinued
that is a shame because they are definately the best sounding headphones that i have ever owned ( and i have owned many )
i have always been in the habbit of purchasing headphones , which are usually heavy , very large , and typically make your ears uncomfortably hot after extended use
after reading rave reviews for the sony , over the past several years , i finally decided to give them a try for myself
after hearing that they were being discontinued i was afraid that i would not be able to find them anymore
i was extremely happy to find them right here on [
] , and for a great price
some of the primary reasons for my decision to purchase this model include the high sensitivity level ( 106db/mw ) , the large 40mm drivers and the impressive , 000 hz frequency response
the high sensitivity allows these headphones to be used with low powered devices , such as my ipod touch
although these headphones sound best when plugged into a home stereo receiver , they still sound stunning when plugged into a portable mp3 player
so if you desire a quality set of headphones , which can be used with virtually any audio device you may own , the sony v6s are the perfect choice
deep bass , smooth and natural midrange , and crisp ( yet not piercing ) , clean treble , these cans produce the widest frequency range that anyone could expect from headphones costing three times as much
the v6s may not be perfect for those wanting bass enhancement
the bass is definately deep with these phones but it is tight , rather than boomy and muddy sounding
these headphones are light ( rated <NUM> g - which is about 1/2 lb ) and comfortable to wear for hours at a time
the clean , uncolored sound will make you soon prefer to listen to all of your music through these headphones rather than through speakers
they do a pretty good job of blocking outside noise without entirely preventing you from hearing the phone ring ( if you have the ringer set loud enough ) , the children calling you , or even hearing the doorbell ring
the build quality is very good and i am expecting these phones to last me for many years to come
they even come with a nice "pleather" case to hold them in when not in use
the phones fold up nicely and fit in the case perfectly
the <NUM> ft
coiled cord is rugged and well shielded , and there is an included adapter to convert the 3
5mm to a 1/4" plug
i would highly recommend the sony headphones to anyone who is serious about listening to quality audio
but don not wait long to order because i suspect that they will not be on the market much longer .
my son really loves these headphones
the really cut out external sounds well and sound very full
for the cost , it is really hard to find this kind of quality in sound .
these are so good i bought another pair
my little bastard cat ate one of the little wires that hang and it broke one of the ears but since sony makes such good stuff i was able to fix it with a little razor and some black tape
i use these to keep my girlfriend from hearing when i write songs about how much i want to kill that cat .
i had always been using junk monitor headphones before i decided to upgrade to a serious set of cups
i decided on this headhone after comparing it to the <NUM> pro ( v6 is amplification , and suitability for all kinds of music )
for someone who has never listened to high quality cups before , it took some getting used from the style sound i was accustomed to before
in the end , i bought the ozonemp ( izotope ) plugin for winamp to get the sound profile i liked
the v6 needed very little amplification compared to my previous maxell studio monitor headphones
i was able to pick up sounds i never new existed
unfortunately , for someone who listens to 128kbps mp3 a lot , this meant a lot of noise , pops and clicks in the music
this was mostly bearable when the music is in full swing , but stands out in the silent sections of the music or really poor quality recordings
the same would be bearable in the maxell ( but without clarity )
the headphone tightness around the ear hurt a lot when used more than half hour
i salvaged the ear pads from my previous maxell studio head phones which fit the sony like a baggy pant
but what a huge difference and relief to the ear
the headphones are still tight , but much more bearable
its almost a must that you change the ear pads , and consider that in the true cost of these headphones .
these sound great
one star removed because a ) it is easy to knock the cushion off the earpiece and very difficult to get it back on and b ) the curly cord is a pain - it gets knotted up on itself easily and is generally in the way
a straight cord would be better .
very good headphones
more 'bassy' than my grado sr60 headphones which are in the same price range
however , these phones surround the entire ear which accounts for some of the additional bass whereas the grado phones sit on the ear and allow for more "soundstage" and in my opinion more accurate sound
the sony phones shut out much more of the room noise than the grado phones do because of their isealed' design
the grados don not shut out any room noise at all by comparison so if you listen in a noisy place you may want to go with these sonys
these phones are good for editing , djs , microphone usage etc
they are fairly comfortable
much more than the sennheisers i tried on , not as much as the grados
however , i don not find any headphones "comfortable" really .
can not complain
these have good sound at a very reasonable price
they do lack a bit in bass for my taste but i am a bit of a bass head so this was somewhat expected
i did almost have to max out the volume on my mp3 player with these headphones so perhaps they would benefit from an amplifier
all in all a good buy .
*this review is not for pro is , just for people like me who want something better than ear buds ! *i just got these headphones yesterday and i have previously owned the sony and the sony and i can safely say that the sound quality of the v6 is at least the same and in most cases better than the previous two
i dont know the technicalities of sound performance but these headphones are *clear* ; even at a pretty loud volume
pros : 1
really good build quality ( metallic hinges and all )
a welcome change after the v700 is2
smallest design out there
pretty quiet
very good sound quality
i heard some lyrics & sound that didnt know existed even though i had been listening to the song for years ! cons : 1
i read from previous reviews that these can be worn for a long time but i didnt find that to be the case ( compared to the xd400 is )
because of the minimalist circumaural design i wouldnt recommend this for folks with larger than normal ears2
high impedance and hence not the best for mp3 players
i had to bump up the volume of my iaudio by <PERCENT> to be able to listen to lyrics
however i am still only at about a third of the maximum and so its not all that bad
"telephone type" voice coil and hence heavy
i would have preferred a one .
i am reviewing this with no typing skill so my mistakes are present i am human
grammatical errors will occur and frankly i do not care
that is satire
actually i am free response for rolling bone
not lance
i own grado i80 is , sony , sennheiser <NUM> hds and able planet 300b series for short
the grados had me but the construction is junk
don not under estimate this
they sound the best
grados fall apart
the are number <NUM> now
the sony is are built better
they are now the best
the sennheisers are built , but lack the sound of the grados or the mdrs
the grados "were" the best but they need to call stanley tools or someone so they can construct something that lasts
the able planets were out of this world with a battery running
no other headphone needs a battery
these phones are the best next to the bose for noise cancelling and bargain
there is a problem with <NUM> of the headphones
the grados are very weakly constructed
i had a whole can fall off
i crazy glued the muff
i mean can
no big deal ( stronger than ever seriously )
my opinion grado , with my most respect should crazy glue the notch you put in to the cans to hold the phone to the set
the sound quality of grados are out of this world
construction junk ! truth ! i hooked the sonys and the sennheisers to an amp for my music
not your stereo
a guitar amp
they held up
understand these are not made for this
if your buying sony , sennheiser or grado and able planet
these all are great phones for your ears
if you want the package
it is the so ifso if : so if : you are everyday person looking for the best head phone for your surround sound system
the sony are for you
they are excellent
if you could get over the cord
buy a straight attachment for these
so if you are the every day person looking for the best headphone in the market *"don not buy" ! " *the sony
find something better
then tell me for that price you got better !
we , are the poor peers for the great ears headphone
loves the only house ! that is cheap for really top of the line music
oh by the way
they are as good as the grado
i mean that
scary good
tell me i am wrong please .
best headphones i ever bought ! fits on my head perfect no need to press down on it to feel the bass ! works well with trance music ! alots of bass !
not as much bass as i thought
but it is not supposed to i guess
just for the studio to get true sound
i need bass headphones though .
they feel overly delicate and the sound quality is &<HASHTAG> ; just ok&<HASHTAG> ; in my opinion
also the coiled cord is curiously heavy and the connector seems like it isn not seating properly as the left channel constantly produces a lot of crackling if you nudge the connector or pull on the cord at all
never had that problem before
sound and build quality of the audio technica is certainly worth the extra cost
they are reasonably comfortable , but every time i pull them out i feel like i am going to accidentally destroy them as i fidget with getting the ear cups out from their folded position .
i love the sound stage of this headphones , i have been using them more and more everyday
besides the shure srh440 are superior ( imho ) for jazz / classical , the sony is are amazing for those mixed playlist .
i am coming from a pair ofpanasonic retro style monitor headphones ( blue ) that had their ear pads in only <NUM> months
the ear pads were $16 each to replace ! no thank you ! judging by the other sony customer reviews and suggestions for better headphones ( on bose headphone reviews ) i decided to order a pair
people saying their first pair lasted for <NUM> or <NUM> years is what i wanted to hear after owning several pairs of headphones that far too quickly
i have owned these headphones for almost a month now and couldn not be happier
durability aside , the sound quality is great
i have had enough different pairs of headphones and home speakers to be able to judge sound quality
the aren not dramatically better than my old panasonic headphones but they do have noticeably richer overall sound and better bass
i enjoy balanced sound for my wide taste in music and these headphones are great for anything i have listened to with them
happy customer here .
like many here , i did a lot of research before purchasing the v6
i considered the <NUM> but i usually take good care of my electronics so i didn not want to pay the extra $15 for it
anyway , i just want to write a review as there are some questions that i wished were answered before purchasing
before i start , i want to let people know that this is my first over the ear headphone
i always use earbuds due to it portability
i run with them so the v6 isn not ideal in that situation
okay , now the review
the product : it is very well made , no cheap plastic parts
the wires are long and good for sitting in one place to listen to your music , esp from a receiver
if you have to walk around while holding your portable music player like my zune hd , then it can be a handful to hold bc you will need to carry the cord around along with your music player
not a big deal , but just a heads up if you are looking for something a little more portable and manageable
i have been using this for a couple of days now and the earpieces hurt my ears after an hour of use
people said it will get better
i only hope so , but i bought a beyerdynamic replacement because i heard it is more comfortable and that it will make the music even better too
i also heard the original earpiece won not last very long
my other complaint of the original earpiece , like others have stated , is that my ears get warm after <NUM> minutes of use and becomes sweaty
the music : i have used $30 sony earbuds and $60 klispch earbuds before and i have to say that this definitely sounds better
the lows are deep , the mids are excellent , and the highs are very clear
the biggest difference between this and my other earbuds is the clarity of the music , especially the vocal
i don not know if the earbud is small single driver or its proximity from inside the ear canal that is causing the sound to be muddy , but this over the ear headphones make the music sound more natural and clear
i used to love a lot of bass in my music and i still do as i listen to trance often
if you are looking for a headphone with booming overpowering bass , then this might not be for you
i was a bit underwhelmed by the loudness of the bass when i first listened to tiesto or hip hop music
i am not saying that the bass isn not good , it is very good , very deep
it is just not eardrum breaking
for alternative , pop , and other music that emphasize vocals and a dynamic range of bass and treble , this headphone performs brilliantly
you can hear all the different instrument being played very clearly
it actually made me fall in love with the vocal of one of my favorite female singer
^_^ if your mp3 conversion isn not great , then you can hear all the crackles and static
i don not know if that is a good thing or bad
one thing i noticed is that i needed to turn up the volume a little more compared to my earbuds to hear the music on the same loudness level
i think perhaps portable music player like my zune hd requires a bit more power for the headphone compared to earbuds
i usually listen to my zune hd at level of , but with the v6 , i listen between
i love music and this headphone has taught me to appreciate it even more
i have learned to love the quality of the music now , and not just the loudness of the bass
as for noise cancellation , it does reduce outside noise by about <PERCENT> imo but there is no noise cancellation , passive or active
you can hear outside noise without music turned on
update after a month of use : music still sounds great
only problem i have is that the earpiece is so uncomfortable
they press against my ears and hurt a lot after an hour of use
it also gets very sweaty too
please keep this in mind before deciding your purchase .
bought these headphones <NUM> years ago
had to replace the ear pads , but they still sound great ! i would buy them again if and when i have a need for a new set of headphones .
once upon a time i thought apple is earphones were the best
i felt like god when i first used cans
it is like upgrading a game character from level <NUM> to <NUM> in an instant .
these are really good headphones
there is a lot of great reviews on these so i am not going to bother going into that
i would be very surprised to hear someone did not like the sound of these
i would highly recommend
i won not take away from the other reviews that state the sound quality for the price on these headphones can not be matched
they are wonderful sounding headphones
there is one serious problem though , which if overlooked , yeah
will leave you without them
my first pair lasted around <NUM> years or so
this latest pair ( not sure if this is a design change ) my sound cuts off on the right phone after only a year
the problem*the wire that runs outside and alongside the headphones sticks out and if you are not careful will get sandwiched in between the phone and the bracket
in time this will wear it and cut the wire
i couldn not believe it but sure enough
the wire is exposed and is causing the right phone to now cut off
i think i can repair it with tape on mine but this is a design problem for those who , like me , didn not realize they were cutting the sound wire over time
a short year
just make sure the wire isn not going between the bracket and phone each time you put them on and it will be fine .
if you love the , you will love the v6s
i was hesitant to switch but after many promising years with my 7506s , i did not feel alienated with the v6 headphones
if i had $350 to spend on headphones , i would still get these any day of the week
rich bass , excellent vocals , and pristine clear sound overall
anyone who works radio , podcasts , or records music will want these .
these headphones have been around a long time
there is a reason for that
for the expenditure these are very hard to beat
the tonal balance is nearly perfect , with perhaps a slight boost in the bass region
they are easy to drive , so even a smart phone gives decent sound
however , with a dedicated amp , they are incredible
i strongly recommend these , even if they have a coiled cord
in fact , i am buying two more sets to use as gifts
well , it is time for an update on these headphones
the sound quality is still great
however , i started having an intermittent problem with the right side not having any sound
the problem progressively got worse and now , there is no sound from the right side at all
this occurred after relatively little use
i have not decided whether to attempt to repair them , or simply buy a new pair
i am removing one star from my review for this problem .
there are lots of reviews here and most appear to be relative to my experience with these headphones
but here are my <NUM> cents : i got these to replace some aging sony is that i purchased maybe <NUM> years ago
the ear cushions of the is had begun to deteriorate , and i figured it was time to see what had improved in <NUM> years
i just compared them to the older v2s and i can say that the v6 is definitely better
they fully surround the ears ( v2s just sat on your ear , pressing on them )
the v6s also seem to offer more detailed sound
i concur that they sound a little bright , but i can take care of this on my ipod by setting the eq to reducetreble ( but i like the brightness , so sometimes i don not do that )
i do not concur with other review comments about weak bass
they appear to have the right amount
( imho - it is a shame that bass has been overemphasized in the past decade , at the expense of flatness and of sound )
i also concur that the sensitivity of these is quite good ( plenty loud for me with the ipod - and i listen at good levels - albeit not ear damaging ones )
as a last comment , i notice amazon has these for about $65
i paid $99 at a local store
buy from amazon ! ( no - i don not work for or invest in them ; - )
the sound is decent and the built quality is great
i certainly think these will last me few years
these however do hurt the first time i wear them but i am sure it will become better in the future .
there are three things i really like about these headphones
the first is that they are light and comfortable
think slippers for your ears
you can almost forget you are wearing them
the second is the total lack of the enclosed sound most headphones have to some degree
this means you can also forget that you are listening through headphones
the third is their startling clarity
you don not have to strain to make out sounds
the overall effect is that the designers of the mdr v6s have effectively removed the headphones from the listening experience
this in itself is a phenomenal achievement
you should have these headphones if only to experience this level of performance
but are they sonically perfect ? well no , not really
the low bass can sometimes sound a bit punchy and thereby be a distraction
the soundstage often does not extend much beyond your head
they are not euphonic headphones which will mask poor material with a big midbass hump ( this is a good thing , actually )
and they sometimes seem a little thin in the lower midrange so that voices might not sound as rich as you might like
but given the way these phones present the sound , they need make no apologies
they produce a clean , uncolored and wide range sound
no wonder people use them for so long .
i am casual listener and looking for headphone which satisfy my need for music and this is where my search has ended .
well , i can not praise these headphones enough , they sound amazing on the average computer , with nothing but a headphone output , and they shine like the sun through an amp and equalizer
they even work very well with the ipod touch , which can tend to be underpowered for larger diaphragm headphones such as these , but once again , they didn not fail to perform
the voice coil is perfect for being able to keep things neat while sitting at a desk , but still being able to have your headphones on , and run over to the shelf , or even stretch them to a room , not kidding ! i just cannot get over the sound quality for such an inexpensive set of headphones
my only gripe is that within the first couple months , i have had to have the ear cups replaced by sony ( free of charge ) and multiple people seem to have this problem
i bought a pair of beyerdynamic cups : beyerdynamic velour earcushions mdr7506 headphonesand they seem like they will last
otherwise , the metal frame , and chamber are impressive , and the hefty cord and ends seem like they will last a good long time
although they are a little chunky/old fashioned to bring in public for some people , i don not have much of a problem with the design
it is very comfortable for long periods of wear as well
edit : these were purchased april 3rd of 2012 , and the right earcup has stopped working as of september 14th 2013 , they served me quite well indeed for the time i have had them but this is really unacceptable , especially considering all of the amazing reviews i have read for how long other customers have had these for
has the quality of construction gone down ? i will try to update my review as for the experience of rma'ing them or getting them repaired , and how much it costs .
i priced many headphones and this one was the biggest bang for the buck ; i can not see how spending more on headphones would make a difference .
pros : cons : uncolored sound
some people may find that these headphones feel warm , or cause sweatingflat frequency response curve
during prolonged use
excellent frequency response range
not many cons imo
these are the best , cleanest sounding headphones that itight , clean , punchy bass response
have heard in the $100 or less category
they are monitors , and they do notclear , crisp , but not overwhelming highs
color the sound in any way
they are meant to accurately reproduce thegood clean midrange
source material
enjoy your new sony headphones
: - ) lightweight , and comfortable even duringextended use .
holy smoke ! this quality headphones make you listen to all of your music collection again ! i tried different ones over the years
so far , this v6 by sony sounds the best
everybody has different hearing , music taste & also different audio equipment
so , the sound quality you prefer to getis a personal preference & not just depend on the specific brand or model of headphone or speaker
it is a try & choose game
the sony is very comfortable on your head & over your ears , nice reproduction of high & low frequencies ( ) it has excellent deep clean bass ( i listen to all kinds of "good" music from alternative to trance )
it definitely sound better than my sennheiser pro ( which is heavier )
still good one though
plug it in -> hit play -> you will fall in love ! &lt ; - ( ( ( ( buy it ) ) ) )
i can not believe i got by for years without owning these , as a music lover
i got chills right away the first time i cranked up some favorite tunes with these new ( old ) cans
( well , new to me
) the frequency response is supposedly hz
at this price point , you'd be hard pressed to find better , i should think
good seal over the ears without being uncomfortable after a while
great sound
short and sweet , well worth the cost .
this headphone is especially good for rock , less so for classical
it sounds best if driven from a low impedance amplifier
in that case , it goes very low , and has some slam in the bass
otherwise it lacks the slam and doesn not go as low
rock vocals cut through with authority ( try the stones for a good experience ! ) , as does electric guitar
i haven not tried them with current pop , but my wife has , and she loves them .
i have recently purchased the sony headphones , after purchasing sony is very similar ( but not identical - see below ) sony mdr7506 professional headphonejust a few months ago
my reason for purchasing a second pair ( and getting both models ) was because these v6 is were very inexpensive at the time i ordered , and because i was curious to see if i could tell a difference between the two
in reading many of the reviews here on amazon and elsewhere , i knew that the two are constructed very similarly but there were different opinions regarding both the differences ( if any ) and which has the superior sound
these are both headphones in the $100 and below price category , which seems like a reasonable price to pay for high quality sound
i do not like to listen to music using earbuds , i prefer this style of "" headphone
although it does take some getting used to
i also have very inexpensivekoss ksc75 portable stereophone headphonesfor occasions when i don not want to use my more expensive sony is
i am very satisfied with the sound quality from these headphones ( both models ) , and with the comfort
they are the first "quality" headphones that i have owned , and the level of detail in the sound , lack of distortion , and overall quality is simply superb
i am completely satisfied
now , regarding both similarities and differences between the sony and sony , here is what i have observed : - externally , they are almost identical in construction and appearance
the v6 has red stickers on each headphone "for digital" , and the <NUM> has blue stickers "professional"
the phono jack for the v6 is silver metal ( all metal ) , for the <NUM> is gold ( rubber and gold )
those are the only visible differences i am able to detect
- when i listen to the two headphones back to back , at the same volume level and with the same music , i can detect a slightly clearer treble and midrange from the 7506 , and very slightly clearer sound
this is consistent with several of the other reviewers on amazon for the 7506 , who say they can detect a slightly better sound separation and more open sound for the 7506 , with the v6 is sounding a bit warmer
one reviewer also says that the internal grounding for the two headphones is different - the <NUM> uses a separate internal ground for the left and right channels , where the v6 uses a single ground for both channels
( it seems to me that both grounds are going to the same place anyway , but maybe this contributes to a slightly different sound )
- some reviewers state that the internal speaker drivers are different for the two headphones
however when i went to sony is website to check the specifications for the two models , that is not what i found
and here is what the wikipedia page states for these headphones : "both models share the same part number for their driver , but the magnet therein is known to vary
the was introduced with a magnet , as is currently used in the
however , at some point , the switched to the slightly more powerful neodymium magnet
these changes were made without changing the driver part number
"- the box for the <NUM> states "neodimium magnet"
the operating instructions included with the v6 state "samarium cobalt magnet"
possibly either or both of these are out of date ( as wiki states , they may make spec changes over time ) - the <NUM> box is copyright 1994 , and the v6 copyright is 1996
- the <NUM> box includes an exploded view and parts list , which is very nice to have
the v6 box does not
- both headphones include a soft case for storing/carrying the headphones , and both include an adaptor plug so that the headphone can be used with either a stereo or a normal size plug
update 7/22/13 and 7/30/13 : the sony and headphones have just recently been reviewed by cnet , with similar comments to my own regarding the small differences in sound quality
both headphones receive a very high recommendation from cnet
see the review at [
] and the review at [
]according to the specifications on sony is website ( which should be ) , the only difference between the two headphones is frequency response : - : - neodymium magnet , 40
0 mm driver , frequency response , <NUM> ohm impedance , <NUM> db/w/m sensitivity- : - neodymium magnet , 40
0 mm driver , frequency response , <NUM> ohm impedance , <NUM> db/w/m sensitivityi am not able to explain how sony is claiming different frequency response for the two headphones if all of the other specs are identical , but this is what they are saying
and the two headphones do have slightly different sound
although there is a slight difference between the <NUM> and v6 , the sound from both headphones is very neutral
the "professional" choice between the two seems to be the 7506 , and it is the more expensive model
if you read other reviews you will find that the 7506 is are commonly used by studio engineers , because they are designed to reproduce the sound just as it is , without adding emphasis to the bass as some other headphones are designed to do
at this point , for me they are both excellent , and for thirty bucks less i'd go with the v6 if i could have only one of the two
i have been using these headphones with theaudioengine d1 converter , and i am extremely pleased with the quality of the sound
as a final comment , some owners of these headphones comment that the ear pads wear out over time , and some owners also prefer different ear pads for better comfort
i also purchased a pair ofbeyerdynamic edt <NUM> velour padded earcushionsfor this reason , and although i have not yet given them a try to compare them with the ear pads that come with the sony headphones , i do like the fact that it is possible to fit different ear pads if desired in order to provide more comfort , as well as replace them when they have become worn ( some owners use these headphones for many years )
i notice that there are a very large number of reviewers for these headphones , many of them owners who feel very strongly that these sony headphones are the best
i am just beginning to use them , but i have high hopes that they will be durable over time and that i will continue to be as satisfied with them as i am today .
comfortable , and sound great
no complaints whatsoever
they feel well made , sturdy , and durable
great for turning the music up to 11 , while still being a good neighbor
would certainly purchase again .
i did a lot of researching before purchasing this and i am very pleased
music just sounds better and i was very much surprised
i am not an audiophile , i am a regular consumer
i have used $200+ earbuds and they don not compare imo to what you can get through headphones
the only negative i can think of is that the padding can get warm if worn for a long time
i bought a replacement earpads ( non sony ) and now it is perfect
i use to study because it can be noisy outside of my room
i would buy this if you are getting your feet wet and want the best for sub $100 headphones
i wouldn not buy this if you care what this might do to your hair .
first headphone purchase of over $20
did extensive research and landed on these
do not overlook the 'fatiguing' that is mentioned , these are definitely high in that category
i find myself keeping them half on / half off my ears a lot of the time to avoid fatiguing and also to be able to hear my surroundings ( i was fully aware of this when purchasing )
but for hard core listening , these are perfect and very fun
also , the tightness that was mentioned is noticeable
as mentioned , i wear these properly about half the time
if not worn properly ( one ear off/one on , or letting the headphones set higher on the head so you can hear your surroundings ) , i noticed pressure
you just have to wear them in
or stretch them a bit and they are perfect
i bought these headphones for quality sound
and it delivers
i would not rate this lower under any circumstances .
omg ! these are awesome straight out of the box
no need for burning in ! i also own audio technica , and monster beats studio
these sony blow em both away
the tend to be a bit flat , the beats a bit bass heavy
these are dynamic and lively along all parts of the spectrum
i am hearing notes , bravados , instrument fades , that i haven not heard before
as i am writing this , i have only on hour <NUM> of listening
i am using my 5g ipod nano w/o an amp ( imagine with a headphone amp ! )
seriously , you won not be disappointed in these
very comfortable , quality construction
buy one now , the price is right , its worth 3x the price in all seriousness .
i love it when someone writes a really good review and i look forward to receiving the item
if you want to be in your own world and hear music in a whole new way , get these ! you will be so glad you did !
i bought two of these
one of them for my so and she pinched the wire in a drawer on the desk and one of the speakers was no longer getting audio
in her work she does board level repair on everything from laptops , smart phones , and desktops , but regardless was not able to fix the issue with a soldiering iron
the wire is mostly rubber , the metal they use is extremely thin , which is probably why it broke so easily in the first place
my headphones still work , but the ear pads are completely worn out
i realize i can buy new pads , but i shouldn not have to .
i absolutely love this headphones
purchased for $99 back in <NUM> and that was big bucks for a engineering college freshman
i loved hifi and dorms were not the placed to drag your equipment
they drowned out the background noise and kept me studying away
i now use them to drown out my children when i telecommute
the sound quality is incredible and the comfort level 2nd to none
i sometimes felt odd traveling on planes wearing them on air planes etc but this style has come around
mine the pad has flaked off
i hope the new ones hold up the same , mine have a rarity now : "made in japan"
highly recommend !
these headphones feels like a stereo in the ear
these reproduce amazingly clean , clear , accurate sound
best headphone till date
i own many in ear , and over the ear headphones which includes some etymotic , sennheiser , sony , creative , panasonic , klipsch image one , brainwavz models and listened to many $100+ models at apple store and best buy
sony is the best till date
these are not tuned to produce artificial booming bass at the cost of mids and highs
buy them without any hesitation and thank me later .
these are very high quality headphones for about 1/3 the cost of the high end ones
i am using them right now at <NUM> am while my wife sleeps in the next room
the sound quality is a great surprise
made well and fit great
the best head phones i have ever owned
i read a lot of reviews before i bought these
i am very glad that i did .
my first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations
you can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones
the bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable mp3 players
toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these
my only regret was not buying this pair earlier .
i love these
they accompany my sansa clip+ perfectly
after burning them in for 40hours and rockboxing my clip , i could not be happier with my $115
00 total portable audio solution ( sansa clip+
these sound great with ipods as well ! bass , mids and highs are great for musical scores , hip hop , electronica , big band jazz , and classical
great buy !
let me echo the raves
i just purchased my 3rd pair
i plug them directly into my access virus kc or minibrute or ultranova or any one of my several instruments and they make me smile
i hear what i play exactly as it sounds on my studio near field monitors
the highs , midrange and base sound perfect
the center feels exactly correct and the instruments seem placed exactly where they should be as do the vocals
sometimes i think that the v6 is are surround sound they are that good
i have tried other brands and other sony is as well but for this price i am getting a $ pair of cans
i saw them for $300 on another site
really ? that is too much , but <NUM> years ago i paid $129 for them and now they are $76 on amazon
if you mix music , dj , or just like listening to music then these are for you
i am glad that sony still makes them
my second pair still sounds great but they are a little ratty for wear
i have replaced the ear pads twice and the headpad is completely wrapped in duct tape and i lost the carrying bag that came with it
so , this time i decided to get a new pair just in case sony stops making them
there are better cans out there , to be sure , but they cost a lot more
i read a few reviews where the reviewers said that they'd found a $40 pair of 'phones that were just as good but
that is right , they started to list a series of buts like the competetion was a little less comfortable , too light or too tight or felt too fragile or the highs were slightly tinny , or weak mids or the bass bottomed out
well , none of that for the v6 is
highly recommended .
not that the <NUM> is better or worse
these have samarium cobalt magnets and the response has more of a smiley face to fool you into not noticing the roll off on both ends
the 7506 , with neodymium magnets , has a flatter midrange but the lack of extension is more noticeable
to repeat : both headphones lack extension , but one doesn not try to hide it and the other does
some people find the <NUM> brighter overall
two different flavors of otherwise the exact same housing & driver design
the nickel or jack has no real world difference
you might get a little more corrosion on the former , but the latter will just wear eventually anyway
samarium cobalt and neodymium both have their benefits
neodymium is stronger and doesn not significantly lose any of that strength over time ( the sound might be more stable ) , but samarium cobalt puts out a more even magnetic field and is more heat resistant
the fact that the weaker magnet on the v6 is preferred by some people might mean the "aging" of the magnet may have something to do with the tone people rave about on their <NUM> year old set
neither model has outstanding bass response or distortion characteristics
pick your poison .
these are great classic "cans"
i have had them for a month and started using them after a few days when these v6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level
and this is what i would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them for about <NUM> hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best
they fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely
bass goes low down to 5hz but it is not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way
from a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch
the only one thing i would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds
i might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts
if you get them for around sixty shipped , then it is a good deal .
these headphones have a very nice sound and are very comfortable
i use them while playing my electronic piano and they seem to deliver a true and full sound
they collapse into a fairly small size and have a nice storage pouch
the cord is a bit short but otherwise they are great .
everyone is hearing is different so this is not really a critical review
i guess you really have to try headphones first , much like speakers
this is one disadvantage with products but amazon is great with returns .
i bought the sony monitor series headphones to replace my beyond redemption sony headphones that have been numerous times and krazy glued more time than i can count
the only thing missing was duct tape
regardless , they were about <NUM> years old and when i couldn not find replacement ear pads , i had two extra sets , i new it was time to replace them
anyway , after doing a lot of research , reading one review after another until i was going blind i decided to by the is
price was a big consideration and at $72
00+ and having very good service with the this became a logical choice
i have only used the headphones for about <NUM> hours and i am very pleased with them
some reviews mentioned a weak base and i agree , but tweaking the eq corrects that well enough for light jazz and ( i go back to early days )
however i have found that listening to classical , especially baroque , the is shine
unlike others , i don not have a problem with the treble
i have found it to be very clean , for lack of a better word
one thing i did find out very quickly is i have to knock the volume down another db
these headphones are very loud
as far as comfort goes , well sony missed the boat
i don not find them to tight but the headband is lacking padding
if you have hair on top it may not be a problem , i don not
the had excellent padding and i salvaged that padding and attached it to the with a bit of scotch tape
looks weird but they at least they are comfortable now
i did knock off a star for the comfort level but the rating is 4
i think they are an excellent buy and the sound is also excellent for my type of music , others who need heavy base may be disappointed
finally they ear pads are very soft and comfortable .
purchased these headphones in 1991 ; i was impressed with their sounded quality
the digital music era was becoming the norm back then and these made cds sound really good compared to other headphones that were available at the time
since <NUM> i have replaced the ear pads twice but the sound quality is just as impressive today
their response is flat allowing you to hear every small nuance in your music even at low volumes
the comfort level is good , i have no issues when wearing them for extended periods of time
when i got these it was not a purchased i thought through completely ( impulse buy ) , i never imagined they would hold up as well as they have for so long and , more importantly , sustain their sound quality as they continue to
no regrets from this very satisfied owner .
these sony headphones are very impressive
i have been using a pair of sony is with a frequency response of 10hz to 24 , 000hz that i got for $50 in the 1990 is
the v6 is are clearly better
deeper and richer bass , significantly better clarity
the sound is precise and delicate
i can understand lyrics better with these phones
my yamaha electric piano sounds much nicer too
it has excellent samples and i can hear a significant difference with the v6 is compared to the 84 is
do note however , you need a quality source to hear this difference
most portable mp3 players don not even take full advantage of my is
i am listening to my msi motherboard with a via chipset , a quality portable cd player , and my yamaha piano
some people scoff at the idea of headphones with a response to 30 , 000 hertz since most humans can not hear above 16 , 000 hz
what they don not understand is that while the typical adult human can not hear a pure tone above 16khz , headphones or speakers that can produce a 30khz tone will sound more clear and precise at frequencies lower than 16khz which we can hear
we can not hear the pure tone but we can hear sharp changes in lower frequencies , sharp changes that can only be produced by a speaker capable of 30khz
headphones are superior in two ways : ( 1 ) by putting pressure on the side of the head rather than the ear lobe they are far more comfortable , especially if you wear glasses
i can wear these for hours with no discomfort
and ( 2 ) they make a better seal around the ear which allows better bass
my only criticism is that there should be a label or at least a mention in the manual saying that the headphones may need a few hours of loud music to wear in , and until they do , one side or the other may have lower volume
at first i worried they were defective because the left side was significantly quieter
i imagine that many people have returned them as defective because of this .
these headphones have great sound reproduction
i also have a medium to large head , and they are comfortable
i have not had any issues with the stock pads making my ears sore
they also cup the ears nicely so they cut out a good amount of outside noise
these are totally worth the $75 or so i paid for them
the sound is comparable to headphones double the price .
the sony monitor headphones are the predecessor of the professional industry standard studio headphonessony mdr7506 professional large diaphragm headphonethat i use as a sound mixer and recordist in the film and television production industry
for my full thoughts on the 7506 , click the link above and look for that review
the two models are virtually identical
the v6 phones were originally released as a high end headphone to appeal to audiophiles who were on a budget
they feature closed ear design with soft lamb skin ear pads , smooth frequency response , and a bass boost popular with djs and contemporary music lovers
the main differences between the two are that the <NUM> phones come with gold tipped plugs and a sticker that says professional on it
the v6 has a sticker that says simply digital and the plugs are standard silver
and the phones are usually about $30
00 cheaper than their professional model
all in all , either model will sound great for whatever purpose you choose to use them for
highly recommended !
i like these a lot and i decided to go with a wired setup for my night time home theater watching
it sucks some times having a wire but sound quality is good and i was able to get two of these for a good bit cheaper than the one set of wireless ones i was looking at .
awesome sound , super clear and crisp
but also
not enough bass for me
somehow *too* accurate for me , i want more somehow .
pros : 1
excellent sound reproduction2
durability ( my original pair has survived <NUM> international trips and almost everyday usage for over a year now ) 4
long cordjust brought another one to be kept at workplace .
if you are looking for a comfortable headset with superior sound without having to spend an arm and leg , this is it
i especially like the comfortable fit , allowing my my ears to fit snugly inside
comes with a nice storage bag too .
i have been searching for a pair of headphones or iem earphones for more than six months
i ordered a pair of jh audio jhj16 pro custom iems for $1149 , complete with an $80 visit to an audiologist for ear canal impressions
one fitted and the other did not
the sound was excellent in the one that sealed well but when
the whole thing was a very bad experience and the iems were eventually returned after three attempts to get both to fit my ear canals
i then ordered a pair of sennheiser hd <NUM> headphones the sound was magnificent right out of the box but the hard ear pads were painful
sennheiser customer service said they would soften with use but for $1500 for the hd 800s , i was not willing to chance it and returned them
next came the sennheiser ie <NUM> iems , again with excellent sound
however there was so much microfonics with any head movement , they too were returned
i tried the best denon is flagship model at the time and found them to be uncomfortable
the same was true with a pair of $1600 grados , also uncomfortable
i had given up until i found a pair of $110 iems and have been using them for a few months
after deciding to try headphones again , i ran across the sony headphones
they had good reviews and i ordered them
today was the first day that i listened to music and tv with the , they are quite comfortable but do not quite fit over my ears , well enough though
i do not classify myself as an audiophile but right out of the box , the sound good
they will be &<HASHTAG> ; burned in&<HASHTAG> ; using music and pink noise during the next few months but they sound is very acceptable
they are well balanced over the frequency range with no discernible distortion
the base is very adequate even for me tendencies
they do not equal the hd 800s or the ie 800s but the do not cost $1500 or even $1000 , either
they have values in spades
try them ; i believe you will like them , especially considering their remarkably low price .
i bought this one during blackfriday <NUM> to be used together with my iphone 5
i am not a professional in headphones but this one meets all my basic needs in daily use at the appropriate price !
the sony is a terrific headphone at a great --i think it is a great compromise between comfort and sound
i have used them as a professional video sound recorded and for my personal music and sound editing purposes
they are rugged--one of my pet peeves is the ear pads fall off headphones and the doesn not have a problem with this
they are compact and light , but still have great sound
my musician friend says they are a recording standard--don not know if this is a fact , but i could believe it
highly recommended--
i purchased these sony headphones for myself for my birthday
these upgraded a similar style ( ) of $25 headphones
i thought my old headphones were good but these new sonys are fantastic
at <NUM> db/mw sensitivity , the 40mm driver provides ample sound volume
the ear cuffs isolate outside noise well
pros : - linear frequency response
bass through treble sound vivid , balanced
- solid construction
metal headband , many screws- comfortable to wear
- flexible "telephone" cord is a plus
- came with large stereo jack adaptor
- folds compactly in ( faux ? ) leather bag
cons : - my old phones had a manual slide volume adjustment on the cord , the sony doesn not
- the headband musses up my hair
i am quite satisfied with these headpones for their sensitive , expressive , accurate , efficient sound reproduction .
i wanted to retire my to my computer and get the studio monitor v6s for the
i was a bit put off by the highs at first until i turned off my is equalizer
going flat and uncolored , these headphones are superb
i love them
they are smaller , lighter than the v600s and sound better to boot
surprisingly , my mother insisted on my ordering a pair for her as well ! the fit and sound appealed to her for playing the organ with headphones , or listening to music cds
i highly recommend these headphones , especially at this price point
----------------------------a return to my original review : it is may <NUM> and i have had these cans for a spell
the longer i own my sony studio monitors , the more i adore them ! there is nothing like a flat and uncolored pair of monitor headphones for pure musical enjoyment as music is meant to be heard
but don not let that lull you into thinking these phones lack power , beefy low notes , or lack a wonderful subtlety in the solidity of the low end
the fact is , cranked up they will make your ears bleed ! their power requirement is also low that i have even used them on an antique radio who is volume is not much louder than a crystal radio
i still highly recommend these headphones !
i have had these headphones for almost two years
the ear pads are pretty close to needing to be replaced ( which wont be expensive at all ) , but other than that these are as good as the day i bought them
i am no audiophile- the sound is very good , but what i love is the comfort
i wear these for upwards of seven hours a day and they are fantastically cushy
the only con i have is that the chord is very long and heavy with the coils , so it hangs off of my computer desk and i can *just* feel the weight of it especially when i move my head
my next pair will be wireless , and probably noise canceling so i don not have to listen to my idiot roommate talk to his gamer friends
one of my favorite possessions .
i did months of research on the internet and asking around to friends in the "audio industry" and kept coming back to these headphones
it seems sony did something right years ago and hasn not strayed from the formula since
this set looks good , fits well , and sounds great
they definitely need a few hours to loosen up to get their best sound , but it is worth it
i feel like i hear everything when i am listening to music
they block out outside sound well enough for me
the cups are comfortable and large enough for my ears
they are highly durable ; i am not afraid to throw them around a little bit , or even stuff them into my backpack
the coiled cord can get heavy at times
i wish it was more of a flat cord and had a cord wrangler like my old sennheiser hd202s ( a good set ) , but if it helps it sound they way it does i am more than okay with it
there is the sony mdr7506 but these are basically the same
some detailed reviews reveal only slight differences in the two sets' response patterns , but it is hardly noticeable
the only real difference is that the <NUM> has a jack whereas the v6 does not
one reviewer noted that if the set was going to be plugged and unplugged repeatedly ( i
not installed in a studio setting ) the gold plating could eventually wear off
as i take my set on the go and plug into various devices , this was fine with me
you cannot find a better set of headphones for under $100
i would recommend these to anybody that likes music .
this headphones are amazing , the sound is really good and the quality of the product is excellent , this headphones are really comfortable , and it didn not weight too much .
use these in my studio and they work great ! can pump a lot of volume through these without them distorting .
i am was so sick of earbuds , that i treated myself to these headphones
only had them a week but i have already realized what i have been missing
the only issue i had was that on the imac , there was no easy way of switching between built in speakers and headphones when the headphones were plugged into the headphone jack
solution was to get a usb adapter ( from an old pair of logitechs ) and now i can easily switch by a single click on the menu bar
highly recommended , and i am seriously considering a second pair to use in work .
what i wanted : , uncolored headphones
my intention was to use for monitoring in the recording studio and for silent bass guitar practice
i noticed that the tv studio where i work used sony 7506 is
i discovered that the are nearly identical
i ordered them and them with the <NUM> only to discover that i could not tell the difference
both were excellent
which brings me to audio quality
they are sonically invisible
i put them on and suddenly , by the resonance of the kick drum , i can hear the shape of the room bonnie raitt is drummer was in when he recorded i will not be broken
these headphones are full , flat , uncolored and clear
they are perfect for what i want--to hear as faithfully as possible
i have owned these headphones for just over a year and i have used them almost every day
no wear or mechanical problems to report .
these are great headphones ! i work in the music industry and for the price point , i would rather buy these versus any of the higher price sony mdr models .
i have been using these headphones for only a few days
i can tell you that these headphones do sound great but for some reason require me to turn the volume really high to get sound out of them
this might just be how monitor headphones are though
but i wouldn not really know
now on to the review
i plugged these into my bose companion speakers and had to turn the volume more than halfway to get the normal amount of sound that i usually get from a regular pair of headphones
now i know what you are thinking
this guy must be deaf if he has turn the volume that loud to hear something
but thats just not the case
now i tried watching videos on youtube and listening to music on the computer and the volume was really low on them with volume turned up halfway on my bose companion speakers
i also plugged these into to my sony walkman x series to test the sound quality
i had to turn the volume all the way up to <NUM> to get surround sound
now with the ex earbuds that came bundled with my walkman i only need to turn the volume up to <NUM> or <NUM> to get the same surround sound
note that the volume limit on my walkman is only 30
so for me to have turn the volume up to <NUM> with the sony its already passed the avs limit which is the safe volume for listening to music
like other reviews have stated before the headphones are extremely sensitive
this was especially noticeable to me when the volume on my walkman was <NUM> or below
the sound from the left and right side of the earpads would keep changing when i was walking around with it especially when the coil came in contact with something else
i was able to solve this problem though by turning the volume up to <NUM> on my walkman
the headphones them self are really light weight and comfortable to wear
the headphone cord itself is heavier than the pair of headphones
i would recommend these headphones if you were to just sit in one place and listen to them
but not if you are constantly moving around with them .
really love the sound quality and comfort of the headphones
they fit well and feel comfortable even hours after putting them on .
sony is earphone headphone are usually heavily tuned , or heavily colored
but this is not the case for mdr
after <NUM> years of use , it still remain one of the best ear phones i ever had
the ear cushions can easily be worn out ( maybe because i have eye glasses ? ) i can not find a replacement
any ideas ?
i knew i was getting something neat just by looking at the brand and all the possitive reviews
these headphones rule , they feel very durable and the sound is just great .
did you hear that ? no
then you clearly don not have these ! joke aside , these are wonderful and clear as day when listening to any form of music by headhunterz ( bass/kick ) or the eagles ( epic crisp guitar )
no need to get expensive headphone into the hundreds when these are right here
i have worked with a few friends of mine in the norway/east europe techno circuit and these are the on the go top rated headphones for when the melody starts nocking in your head and you need to get it into the computer as fast as you can with as much clarity as you can
personally i would rate these from home hobby to professional produces ( as a travel or monitoring aspect ) and leave the real high ends for live studio ( over $ )
so in short , you get these and your mix comes alive with terrible sounds that your old headphones missed
which in the by the end of the day will sound crisp and colorful thanks to sony is .
at this late date i don not have much to add to many of the great preceding reviews
i have a set of bose headphones with which i listen mostly to music when working at my desk/computer and a sony mdrv6 ( mainly for when i am watching tv ) that i have had for nearly <NUM> years and it is still going strong ; that is why i purchased this second set - and the price was too attractive to ignore
throughout the years i could not tell any difference in sound quality or clarity ; and since rap music is not to my musical taste , i have no issue with the "bass" notes as stated by other reviewers .
are you kidding me ? these are nice
i did alot of research and admittidly , these did not have the most universally poitive reviews in the sub-$100 bracket
i have a big head and these feel like a feather on me
especially compared to my logitech gamers
which are not comfortable at all
the sound on these are clear and crisp
there on my head now and i actually had forgotten for a few minutes
my biggest concern was they would hurt and they dont at all
i love the cord
the fold up feature is nice and they sit compact on my desk ( unlike the is )
i have not tried any other "cans" so my experience is obviously limited and the group has some other highly rated headphones
the grado /80 ; at ad700 ; and the 555 is all get good reviews
good luck chosing if you have to
these are very nice imo .
the <NUM> things that all great headphones have in common are : durability ; sound quality ; comfort
1 ) durability : this may very well be the most important factor of headphones
by definition , headphones are meant to be portable
everyone at one time or another has thrown their headphones into a backpack or laptop case
headphones generally need to be replaced only when they break or get misplaced
the are just about the most durable things i have ever seen
it is classic sony construction
mostly made of metal and thick in the vulnerable parts , these are built to last
in addition , they collapse to a nice compact shape further enhancing portability and durability
the coiled cord is also designed to last
think telephone cord
so unless you have a pet who insists on chewing things , the cord will never be the reason you replace these
finally , they come with a bag for even more durability
if you are even considering the bose triports , slap yourself sober now
i can snap the triports with <NUM> fingers
2 ) sound quality : the sony digital line of headphones have been the standard for audio clarity for decades
so if you are jaded by past experiences with line of sony headphones , don not be
these are on par with the newer line of sony headphones
digital sound by nature is tinny
but these headphones give equal clarity and attention to the low and mid frequencies
i often listen to classical music , and woodwinds , bass and percussions glisten through these headphones
i also use these for , rock , pop , jazz and everything under the sun except country
these headphones excel across all genres
now with the obligatory comparison to the bose triports
with bose triports , i have to really exert myself to isolate instruments and sounds
the isolate sounds for you
you can just sit back and enjoy the show
in addition , bose triports sound like your listening underwater when compared to the
once again , 1/2 the price , more than 2x the performance
dominate this category
3 ) comfort : these are heaphones
these require careful placement on your ears
for maximum comfort , place as much of the pad directly on the fattest parts of your earlobe
i know it sounds , but place them a bit forward on your ears
if placed properly , these are as comfortable as any set of headphones i have ever owned
i have a really big head , and these headphones with a tight headband give me no problems on even <NUM> hour flights
like any headphones , you will need to move them around to discover what is most comfortable for you , but once you find your sweet spot , these are as comfortable as you will ever need
these are great headphones no matter what price range your consider
sennheuser , , bose , or whatever brand you are considering
stop right here and click "add to cart"
you won not be disappointed .
these are time tested phones that i feel shine in the rock genre
a healthy bass and clear highs bring out the bottom without clouding the top .
these are so much better than headset in their price range , they are a
if you are a beatz from dre fan , obviously you don not really care about sound quality , so keep on moving
the reason the normals want these is because we are looking for great quality sound , under $100 , that won not leak all over the room
the build quality is exemplary
there is metal all over this thing
when you compare it to the plastic stuff out there , they feel like toys
these are passive noise cancelling , but are super comfy and just completely seal you away from the world
i thought they were too big , and wanted to send them back
i tried to replace them with other headsets and eventually saw why there are 600+ reviews , mostly positive
just buy them , even to test the hype
you are probably going to be underwhelmed at first
then compare them with all the other headphones in the price range you think will be better
you will keep these , and probably add your own positive review
it is nice to know they are durable and will last a very long time
i love these things , full stop .
pros -the audio is good once you burn it for 50+ hrs , the build looks solid that will last yearscons -heavy and uncomfortable
it presses hard on ears so you can not listen to for long time ! i returned to to get more comfortable ones even though i got these ones at very good price 49$ from amazon
i am no audiophile , but i have been an amateur musician for the last <NUM> years
these headphones are an excellent choice for the price
comfortable fit , brilliant highs , booming lows and middy mids - also very good ambient noise blocking
even with no input i have to take them off to have a conversation
overall - just another really great product from sony
you can get much better cans than these , but not at this price .
the quality is what you would expect of sony , consistent and well made
i also am a bose enthusiast , but i was impressed with all the specs on the sony digital headset , so i thought i would give them a try
i was not let down , they fit good , comfort is good and the sound quality is very good .
i used to use a set of these headphones back when i did some minor video production work , and was always impressed by their full range and sound quality
i am not an audiophile , nor will i act like an expert in sound quality , but i am very pleased with these headphones
i have been plodding along with some old koss headphones on my gaming rig , and they were clearly at the end of their long life
i have a nice little 5
1 surround setup for my computer to play games with , but when the wife goes to bed , i have to plug in the ear cans
going from all of the glorious booms and rumbles i get with the sub attached to my 5
1 system to the lack luster sound of my old headphones was jarring
well i can say that this is no longer a problem with these sony headphones
these produce a full range of sound that makes me forget i am wearing headphones instead of listening to my full speaker set
not overpowering on the low end , and not too tinty on the high
as for the comfort on the head , some have said they dislike them , but i have no complaints
i wear glasses , which can be problematic for extended periods of time with some headphones , but so far , these don not bother me at all , even after hours of continuous wear
if anything , the only problem i have with these , is that they block out the sound so well around me , that i can not hear when my wife comes into the room
she was trying to talk to me the other night , and i had no idea she was speaking , which may get me in trouble one of these days .
i have a set of sennheiser <NUM> headphones and i must say these do have more detail and clarity
they are very comfortable to wear
i highly recommend them
they are also very efficient ( doesn not take a lot of power to drive them )
i bought the beyerdynamic edt <NUM> velour ear cushions to put on them , and did they make a difference
very comfortable .
i have had these headphones since about 1987
i can not think of one other piece of electronics that i still own and use
the bass on these are so phenomenal , but it is not overpowering
you hear every piece of every piece of music
highs are also excellent
these are the one thing that sounded better than my ( klipsch is )
the only thing i have replaced is the ear coverings , themselves
otherwise , just as perfect as ever and very comfortable , to boot
you will love them if you buy them .
after moving to guam , i cannot find any decent audio store on this island ! audio store is out of the picture here ! i decided to switch to music system and a pair of good headphone ( fortunately , i am not addicted to hype )
by doing some homework , i found a very decently priced &<HASHTAG> ; audirvana plus&<HASHTAG> ; for aiff playback
however , i still need a pair of decent headphone to complete my macbookpro + audirvana plus music playback &<HASHTAG> ; system&<HASHTAG> ;
please believe me , you do not want to have too much $$$ stuff in your apartment/house on this island ; otherwise , you may find them &<HASHTAG> ; all gone&<HASHTAG> ; when you go home ! that is why i target on a pair of headphone less than $100
again , going on the internet , doing some google search , i found this sony
ok , the following is my <NUM> week impression on
fresh out of the box , it sounds a bit harsh , and i felt sound fatigue after about <NUM> minutes of continuous listening
but , this is not the &<HASHTAG> ; problem&<HASHTAG> ; at all
i ran in this headphone by playing music into it continuously for <NUM> days , and the sound is much better now ! i am expecting it will keep improving after about <NUM> to <NUM> month ( s ) to have both drivers settled
( will update about this part later )
the sound of this headphone is like what they are designed for
almost no coloration
before writing this review , i saw two extreme ends of reviews
most people were using this pair of headphone for years , and some reviews are cursing sony
the story may ( very likely ) be that sony has discontinued this headphone in japan , and the replaced model is ( v6 was the cd600st )
in japan , all v6 is are actually &<HASHTAG> ; imported&<HASHTAG> ; ! sony actually moved the original production line of v6 to china , and later , to thailand
since i only own this headphone for one week , i really are not in the position to judge the qa of v6
mine v6 is printed &<HASHTAG> ; made in thailand&<HASHTAG> ; on the box
maybe few years later ; if i still remember this review , i could provide more info about how long does mine v6 live .
based on the reviews thought i'd give this babe a try and boy have i been impressed ! i tried them with my iphone <NUM> and they sounded good
but , when i lost my iphone , i used my 30gb zune player that i got from my daughter as she got an ipod and then i turned on the eq setting
man , i heard sounds i never heard before from a stereo or headphones ! the bass was awesome and i could hear the words much better ! words i never knew what the singer was singing ! so folks , it depends on your player for some awesome sounding bass
i am not sure if there is eq app for iphone , but i will check when i get my replacement in a couple of months or some other phone if there is an eq on the phone ( doubt it , though may be surprised )
there ear pad on my left ear hurt a little at first after a little while but i adjusted the head band so it took most of the weight on top of my head and that worked
good luck in finding your headphones ! i found my babe .
i got these about a year or so ago
they sound good and are comfortable but after a year the covers on the ear piece are falling apart and are not cheap to replace .
i studied everything on the market , and shopped all around for the best product i could find
i was told to look for the greatest frequency response on the market
these headphones have a frequency response of <NUM> hz - <NUM> khz
i found that i could have gotten a lower rated hz , but at a cost of over $200
that was not an acceptable price for my budget
these headphones are very comfortable , reasonably priced , have a longer cord than absolutely necessary , have adapters for different size plugs , and outstanding quality of sound
what more do you want ? ; o )
got these for my teen who is a budding musician
he says &<HASHTAG> ; these headphones have okay mids and amazing lows
they can hurt your ears after a few hours of use from squeezing but its not that bad
i use them for music production and music listening&<HASHTAG> ;
he would recommend them .
like going on a carefree vacation ! no packing ! no traveling ! just put on ! tune in ! and relax ! as everything fades away ! no vacationing from your vacation when you get back ! no luggage to lose ! no brutal baggage handlers ! savage porters ! nasty bell hops ! just a little righteous brothers ! john denver is voice so rich ( a download ! ) ! and cosmic hum ! all awesome ! thanks amazon ! a sony sound demo was like actually being there ! shockingly clear ! a demo for cheaper headphones ! accidently played on top of cosmic hum ! so awesome ! love it ! ear buds ? last resort ! thanks again amazon ! best choice ever !
after window shopping at a bunch of stores and testing countless headphones , i decided to settle on this particular set for the sound quality
the sound is amazing and definitely worth the money
i only wish i could have gotten a little bit more bass out of it , but i can complain too much due to the other aspects of this headphone .
i had the in the early 1990s
loved them but for some dumb reason replaced them with
i was never happy with the v600s and now <NUM> years later just replaced them with the
right out of the box
instant clarity , deep accurate bass , an articulate musical sound
not sure what the v6 has that makes it so good .
i was looking for headphone with high fidelity , and surprise
i got it at a reasonable price , its the best i ever buy
this is great headphone for treble lover , its midrange is adequate but the bass is very minimal
i hear sounds that require good speakers to deliver on this headset , the treble is very clear , human voice is beautifully reproduced ; on thx movies the imaging is very impressive
however , there is very little bass in it
it rated as <NUM> hz to 30mhz , i don not know how sony comes up with the low frequency rating , that is lower than most 12'' sub woofer can deliver
i doubt it can go lower than <NUM> hz and you have to look for it
this headphone has the characteristic of electrostatic speakers , clear treble and lack of full audio body , it is suitable for light jazz or the like but not much elsewhere .
* comfort : * ear cups are very comfortable and don not make my ears or head ache after hours of use* headband is flexible and doesn not hurt my head in any way
other reviewers complained of these being uncomfortable and too tight , but i have not experienced this at all
my head is large , btw
* on comfort* cord* long and coiled* thick and durable* a bit bulky for desktop computer or phone use* connector* thick and solid all metal design* sound* outstanding ! best i have ever heard* deep bass* music is rich and beautiful* podcasts are so clear , it is like being in the studio* compared to other headphones : because of the range , i have noticed that i must turn down the volume on these when doing comparisons
* i am not an audiophile , but these headphones are making me a more discerning listener

i already own a pair of these sony mdrv6 series headphones & enjoy them very much
i bought these as a second pair since sony discontinued them
these replacement headphones sound exactly as my other sony mdrv6 headphones
hope these last me as long as my other pair which are now ten years old
these headphones offered by amazon are worth the price i paid !
that pretty much sums up the audio dynamics of the incredible sony headphones
the reviews i have read on the web that mention reduced midrange are pretty much correct
i just didn not know having small sounding ( not tinny ) dead centered in your head lead vocals would be the result of it but it is
same thing listening to dvd is
and this may be due to the different ways certain audio is recorded because kenny rankin is vocals on his "because of you" cd sounded live and real due to it being recorded live in a hardwood floor concert stage and , in the words of chesky records
"using minimalist miking techniques and without overdubbing or artificial enhancement to ensure the purest and most natural sound possible"
another cause for the somewhat echoless disembodied vocals is the sound dampening foam within the ear pieces
other than that if you like clean , accurate bass right down to near earthquake frequencies , the v6 is will deliver with amazing clarity and with very little distortion
as an example about <NUM> minutes into propellerhead is "on her majesty is secret service" during a quiet violin interlude there is a barely audible low resonant bass frequency that doesn not reproduce on my home theatre system with vented sub as well as off my sony earbuds and other audio equipment
the v6 plays it perfectly without overpowering and muddying delicate detail
and open range is gunfight battle , the most realistic i have ever heard in any movie sounded exactly as it did in the theatre on the v6 is
however , some live sounding jazz quartets like the ones recorded back in the '60 is may loudly resonate very low upright string bass frequencies depending on how it was recorded as it did on some julie london songs
it had me reaching quickly to adjust the bass on my <NUM> sansui 2000a amp before my ears bled
a noticeable hole exists in the upper midrange that creates that slight bass hum in human vocals talking on a mic is quite evident on the v6 is
but that is what they were designed to do anyway and probably the reason why they are favored by radio dj is and announcers
but hey , nothing is perfect , but for the money these are the best sounding headphones i have ever heard .
i had two pairs of these headphones that both broke in a few months
i don not get why the cord looks so very when the part you work with the most is so brittle .
with over <NUM> reviews on these why add yet another
aw , what the heck
i purchased my first pair of when they first came out in the 80s
you need to realize that a driver that could faithfully reproduce sound down to and below 20hz was unheard of in consumer audio at that time
these phones stunned me when i was able to hear content on certain recordings that i had never heard before - mostly in the spectrum from 80hz and down
this was an unusual experience via headphones
the clarity and truthfulness of the audio the produce is stunning to those who value accurate audio reproduction
their ability to deliver very high volume levels without distortion is a joy ( in moderation - doing this too often will result in hearing loss )
they are even more stunning when one considers the price compared to the more esoteric audiophile phones available that can run <NUM> to <NUM> times more in price
i had that first pair of phones for about <NUM> years before someone stepped on the frame and snapped one of the driver is clean off
i replaced them with a new pair which i still own
they are pushing <NUM> years old now and still sound very good
after an estimated <NUM> hours of use , the ear pads are flaking off and the left driver had begun to occasionally on high volume , low frequency content
so i have ordered my third pair of these beauties over the course of almost <NUM> years
thank you , sony , for continuing to manufacture this excellent product at an amazing price
a popular trend in headphone design today involves intentional gain manipulation over certain frequencies - mostly on the low end ( beats by dr
dre )
if they sound good to you , who am i to tell you different ? i personally enjoy hearing recordings as close to their original mix as possible
the do that extremely well
when you can actually hear the full audio spectrum delivered with very little coloration , you might be surprised at how enjoyable some recordings are with little or no adjustments to the equalization
the only shortcoming on these phones is the fact that the wire that runs from the left ear cup up and over to the right ear cup is exposed where it travels over the stainless steel band on each side
this is a pretty small gauge wire and if you accidentally pulled on it when removing the earphones or pulling them out of a backpack , there is a possibility of the wire being damaged
and if that wire is ever broken , it is basically impossible to repair
nearly all headphones use very fine stranded , coated wiring
the coating makes it practically impossible to repair once broken
it cannot be soldered or twisted together
so if you are rough with your phones , consider this
if accuracy is important to you look no further
buy these , then buy a backup pair !
i have been using various sony headphones throughout my <NUM> years on this planet , and have always been more than happy with them , but i have always just stuck with the cheaper models
recently , i decided to buy some new headphones
i tried out some other brands , such as sennheiser , but in the end i decided to come home to sony
this is the first time i have bought a pair of headphones in this price range , and all i can say is , i wish i had spent the money on these years ago ! i had no idea what i was missing ! the sound is very smooth yet precise , the bass response is just right and the highs are not overly bright ( like the sennheisers i tried )
i have generally never cared for cans ( most ones i have tried either squeezed my head or irritated my ears ) , but these are super comfortable
i have been wearing them all day ( in fact i am listening to them right now ) , and although my ears are a tiny bit sweaty after wearing them all day , they are still perfectly comfortable
for those of you that are on the fence about stepping up to the $60+ price range , i would say you absolutely need to get these
they are worth every penny .
a little on the large side , but the sound is very good
a great value for the price
i am glad i got these
sure beats little ear buds in sound quality .
only had these for about a week and so far only listened to them through a laptop is 1/8 in jack using one of itunes' streaming radio &<HASHTAG> ; electronica&<HASHTAG> ; stations , <NUM> kbps
these phones sound great
i feel like i am there in gayfm is club
i am not gay but that is none of anyone is business anyway ! the headphones come with a built in 1/8 jack and a comes with a 1/4 adapter
the coiled cable is great and stays out of the way
so far comfort is ok , a little snub but not uncomfortable
i have big ears and the cup seals fit around my whole ear
i haven not worn them for longer than an hour so i can not say about comfort longevity
the bass is surprisingly full and highs are crisp
i like a thick bass sound and i sampled one of itunes' 320kbps electronica radio channels
the bass sounds incredible through these
the earcups flip over <NUM> in case you need to use them like a dj
i never owned a fancy set of phones before so i can not really make any comparisons
i like to think i have a pretty distinguishing ear and my ear likes the sound from these headphones
you get a great sound for the price
i had the studio mdr7506 model in my wish list for about a year then saw these at a discount price so i went ahead and got them
the wider freq range sold me ( i don not know about audio features but sounded reasonable to me wider is better )
i haven not had a chance to try each side by side so i hope i made the right choice in going cheaper
so far , i am satisfied until i hear a better sounding model .
i picked these up during black friday on sale
being a long time believer in sony headphones and a long time user of the now retired v700 is i knew i was going to get a quality product
these headphones have surpassed my expectations , they are light , very comfortable and the near field sound is perfect for a alt
production reference
these headphones are worth $109 every day of the week and if you catch them on sale like i did , you win even more !
my dad bought a pair of these in the late '80s
i remember being a at the time and thinking they were the best sounding headphones ( or speaker for that matter ) that i'd ever heard at the time
my dad still has his and i actually picked up a pair of replacement pads as his had long disintegrated
found the pads for real cheap on a website mentioned in one of these reviews
his sounds just as good as they did new 20+ years ago
i grabbed these for an awesome black friday price
these sound incredible , such detail with just the right level of bass ( for me anyway )
now if you are in to xtreme bass , you will probably want to look for something that is marketed in that direction as these are not over the top
comfort wise , they get a little warm on the ears after a while but they are enclosed over your ears so what headphones wouldn not ? as far as fitting too tight , blame that on your mother and father for giving birth to someone with too big of a head
these are very comfortable and i can easily go a couple hours at a time in these
beautiful sounds on instrumental , rock , techno , classical
anything really .
ive listened to the ultrasone , sony ( ) , grado sr80i , and the sennheiser hd598
the hd598 wins
the ultrasone has absolutely terrible sibilance/sibilant
this is a common complaint with these cans
the <NUM> has better bass than the hd598 , but the sibilance ruins these cans
not even listenable
the sony ( aka ) are phenomenal cans , but rather boring
these are some of the most popular headphones ever made , for good reason
they do sound incredible , and they are inexpensive
every sound is fantastic
however , it can be boring for people who are not used to it
people in the audio industry refer to them as flat , and flat is the perfect way to describe them
and some people love this sound , it grows on you after a while
the are studio monitors , which mean they are primarily made to be used in a studio or with other professional applications where you can monitor how loud a particular sound is
these cans heavily emphasize the mids , and thats not necessarily a bad thing
those who love acoustic music or love hearing vocals will prefer these over the hd598
some treble and some &<HASHTAG> ; hissing&<HASHTAG> ; can be heard on occasion , but overall these are amazing headphones if you like flat sound
the bass is very nice and never muddles the midrange or treble
isolation is actually really good
i do have a problem with the left side of the headphone
if i move my head at all , and i mean at all , a part of the headband makes a swearing sound
i fixed it by wrapping some material around it
an easy fix but i should not have had to do this
these cans provide excellent detail , but can also be unforgiving on recordings that are subpar
overall , excellent phones and i highly recommend them to everyone
the grado sr80i are another great set of headphones , but they are uncomfortable and dont appear to be made as well as the other headphones on this list
overall they sound great
the bass is almost , like the hd598
the overall sound signature was not as clean as the
the is just so clean and precise , very hard to beat
but the sr80i are still great headphones and i would probably prefer to listen to music and game with them more than the sony is
the grado is sound like what you are used to , which is not studio monitor headphones
now the sennheiser hd598
i have the least experience with these , but they are so good i dont need extensive experience
they are extremely comfortable , excellent sound reproduction , and excellent soundstage
i have listened to many gaming headphones in the $50 price range and these are several tiers above them in every way
soundstage is so important in gaming , especially first person shooters
i use these with battlefield <NUM> and they always accurately pinpoint all the sounds
music is crystal clear and silky smooth
no sibilance or harshness ever hear
i do wish they had more bass , but the open nature of these cans makes these bass light
well made and sound great for an affordable price .
these are okay headphones for the money but the earpads are totally faulty ; they don not last very long , which is really annoying
i had to replace them at least once a year , at additional cost and frustration because they split open
while you can buy replacement ear pads it is really a pain to install them
sony simply needs to make more durable ear pads
the other thing is that they cook your ears
after a while wearing these , your ears start to feel really hot
the ear pads also press against your ears so they start hurting after wearing these for a while
these are not made for long listening periods unfortunately
these headphones look cool and provide fairly good isolation and good sound quality over the entire frequency range
they are the same as the more expensive models except these don not say "professional" on them and have less of a warranty
for the price , these headphones are fairly comfortable ( but not the most comfy headphones available ) , and they sound pretty good although i have certainly heard better
there is little to no sound leakage and they provide good isolation in a foldable design that looks cooler than most other headphones
i would say these are good monitoring headphones ( for audio engineers , djs , etc
for music lovers , they are certainly usable but you won not get that notickle me ears' type of 'wow ! ' feeling from the sound out of them like with some other higher end headphones
if it wasn not for the truly faulty ear pads , i would give these a higher rating .
these are very comfortable headphones and have a nice long cord to wrap around your work area
as for the sound , the highs are great but the mids seem muffled and the bass is lacking the a deep sound that i prefer in the house/reggae/dance music that i listen to
also you will find your ears getting a little sweaty after prolonged use with any over the year headphone
overall a great pair of headphones but definitely not the amazing set i was hoping for after reading all these other positive reviews .
i have had earphones that were , earbud , , and whatever else is available
this was my first set of headphones and the fit was much better for longer uses than any of the other
the bass surprised me at first with how distinct it was ; probably as good as any desktop speakers i have had
the cord is long , so i can move around my desk a bit with pulling on the plug
and , of course , the sound quality is great
the fact the padding goes around the ear and sits on the head also gives it implicit noise reduction , so you can get a lot more out of whatever you are listening to without having to jack up the volume
overall i was very impressed by these headphones and would highly recommend them .
i bought a set of these to replace an old set of i had that were falling apart
these are great phones for the price ! very light , good reproductions , comfortable to wear
the headband padding is not quite so thickly padded as the v600 but good enough
i am sure there are audiophiles who can rip on their response in this or that frequency , but for my money these are the best in their price range .
i am no audiophile but i have to say that these are easily the best pair of headphones i have ever had
at first i thought they were ok but then i read that you have to wear them in so i just played music that had heavy bass and distortion for a little while
not sure if that is the way to break them in but it worked
after that , it is been smooth sailing
i do have to agree that the earphones do get a bit tiring to wear after a while
one can easily switch them out but i don not care that much since i only wear them a couple of hours a day
as for the music itself , it is very very clear
i can hear things i have never heard before
the bass is actually thumping , each guitar chord is heard , and minute noises are distinct
great set of headphones and i would totally invest in another pair .
great sound , durable , comfortable , and very reasonably priced
i purchased these in <NUM> and have not regretted my decision once
i like these headphones so much that whenever a friend or coworker is looking for a new pair of headphones , i immediately recommend these ones
i think <NUM> of my fiends have also purchased them after trying them
i even had a friend exchange his beats for these
what i like : -great sound profile , with just the right amount of : i can wear these for hours without having to take them off or adjust , coiled cord : because of the coil design it is only a couple of feet long , which makes it manageable
if you need it longer it easily stretches ( but not strains ) to several more feet
-comes with an adapter : this comes in handy when i need to plug them into my of the over the ear design of the headphones , they block out sound nicely
i can use them on an airplane without having to crank up the volume and or losing quality because of the ambient noise
they also do a good job blocking out ambient noise in coffee shops and long road trips in the car
what i don not like : - maybe a little bulky to wear in public , but that hasn not stopped me from using it on mass transit
buy them , you will not be disappointed !
paid $67 on amazon
bought these for my dad for christmas , along with an mp3 player
very good sound quality
picked up some aftermarket earpads based on previous reviews and are very comfortable
definetly recommended .
i have been using these since they first came out
i was a recording engineer at the time and a friend who was a boom man on movies turned me on to them
i have tried many other headphones over the years , but these have always been and continue to be the gold standard
some may not find them as comfortable as other brands , but they get better over time and the sound quality is definitely worth the investment
when these first came out , they were put in sony is consumer line but as does happen in audio , the pros got turned on to them and before long , they were outselling the headphones in sony is pro line ( who complained loudly : -o )
sony then introduced the <NUM> into the pro line and charged more money for them ; - )
i remember for a while it was hard to find the v6s
but apparently , so many professionals complained that eventually , sony made the v6s available again
i don not use these to listen to my ipod for several reasons
number one , they are highly accurate
while that sounds good , what it really means they are very flat in their response
no presence boost , no bass boost
zip , nada ! that may make them seem "dull" when compared to other headphones but in essence , for a professional who is trying to capture audio accurately , it is a blessing
the second reason is , they are too big to fit in a pocket with your ipod
when done listening , i wrap my etymotics around my ipod and shove the whole thing in my coat pocket , no worries
even if you fold these guys up , you will have a tough time getting them in all but the largest pockets
one final thing i can add that has nothing to do with the use of the headphones per se , is the bag that comes with these is a pos
i learned early on that they rip , flake , and basically fall apart
when my first one disintegrated , that same movie sound man turned me onto the perfect replacement
a crown royal bag
the headphones fit perfectly and <NUM> years later , i am still using the same bag
leave it to the liquor folks to outdo the audio manufacturers when it comes to quality packaging
: -d enjoy
as i said , i have for over two decades now
i had these headphones since around 2000 , its been so long ago
i work as digital artist , so these headphones are being used <NUM> hours a week for the past <NUM> years
they still work as good as the day i got them
i have dropped these headphones countless of times and there is little to no damage
the only thing i had to replace is the earpiece as they become flaky after years of use
i would recommend these to any who wants a great set of headphones and don not want to pay overrated high price for some others
there must be a reason why people are still buying the that have not been discontinued yet
really a great set of headphones .
i was looking for some good headphones for my desktop pc
these are very comfortable and the sound is pretty good as well
the physical quality of these headphones are very good as well
i use these all the time
the black material covering the foam ear pads is starting to tear at the base of the speakers
i will have to buy replacement foam pieces in the future but the tear has not propagated so i think they should last a while longer
my ears do get hot after wearing them for awhile but that just shows a good seal around the ears i suppose
i would recommend these headphones even though they seem to be a little high in price perhaps given how long these headphones have been around .
i bought my first pair of these in <NUM> and am still using them
i am so paranoid that one day sony will cease their production i have purchased several pairs so i will have them up until i die
it is a testament to their quality that sports broadcasters , music producers , djs , and other professionals needing optimum sound quality continue to use these
what impresses me the most is the bass reproduction and high end timbres
i am telling you , many years ago when sony would roll out new models of headphones i would spend <NUM> to <NUM> times as much as this pair , thinking that the quality would be a step up
that was never the case
these headphones have stood the test of time and i cannot recommend them highly enough
they are durable , and reproduce voice , music , anything with a clarity that is unrivaled .
purchased these as a replacement for a set of sony is ( over <NUM> years old ) that my daughter recently had the distinct pleasure of breaking
i am , by no means , an audiophile , but i could immediately tell the difference in sound quality over any headphones i have ever used
these are way more comfortable and seemingly a lot higher quality as well
sometimes i put them on just to drown out the ambient noise , as they work beautifully at isolating external sound
i also love the fact that you can replace just the cups when they wear down
i am very happy with this purchase and feel that these are top of the line
additionally , my brother feels seems to think these perform better than his beats by dre headphones ( i personally never jumped on that bandwagon )
overall , a great product at a great price
would recommend all day long .
i have enjoyed using this model of sony headphones for more years than i can count
my older set has been restored with fresh ear pads , and this newer set shares the same excellent sound quality , comfort , and workmanship
highly recommended .
first off , my initial impression of this headphone was astonishment
the build quality all the way down to the solid way the headphone clicks into place when you extend each side was superb
also , the fit was very good , i am 5'11 with a muscular build , and they cover my ears fine
when i put them on , i immediately noticed how quiet everything was , even with music playing low volume , i couldn not even hear myself typing this review on my very loud razer blackwidow keyboard that clicks every time you strike a key
the v6 is an older design ( more than <NUM> years old ) , and it shows
persoanlly though , i like the design and the look
it is very different from the designs common to other inexpensive sony headphones
the headband is wrapped in pleather , with minimal padding
metal strips attach the earpieces to the headband
the driver housings are of black metal , a plus
the cups are covered in crinkled pleather
the coiled cord is one meter long at rest , but extends to three , and attaches to the left earpiece
the plug is a mini ; the 1/8" adapter ( included ) screws on , to prevent accidental extraction
both plug and adapter are nickel plated , rather than gold like the more expensive mdr <NUM> ( basically the same headphone with different stickers , gold plating on the jack , and an extended warranty ) , which is the only visible sign of the v6 is relatively low price bracket
the v6 folds , in the manner of some of sony is other headphones ; that is , the ear pieces swing up under the band , to form a more compact package
after this treatment the v6 fits into the black pleather bag it comes with
since the range is so large ( ) you can hear everything , including the distortion of not well leveled sound
but that is whey these were made for the studio , and not really for personal listening
i am really glad that whenever i download songs , i make sure they are 192kbps or above
you can really hear any subtle nuances of instruments in the backround which is really an added plus
so if you get these headphones , make sure your music files are up to par
i cannot believe that that these headphones are under 100 , and even further disbelief that i did not buy these earlier , they are one of the best headphones i have ever put on
forget beats , go oldschool and get these studio monitors
okay , these arnt all perfect , by now , my ears are getting a bit warm ( lack of ventilation ) but i guess that comes with any over ear headphones
also , with thourough research , i found that the padding flakes off ( the leather isnt real ) but they can be replaced for under <NUM> bucks
another padding that fits is the padding of beyer headphones which some say are a bit more comfortable , but i like these fine
these v6 is last a very very long time , and is a great investment
i highly suggest it , you wont regret it
also , a friend told me to let these play for a couple hours on high volume to "break them in"
she also has these but for me , they play fine righto out of the box .
first off , i am not an audiophile
this will horrify some people , but i am not all that picky when it comes to sound
i am happy listening to movies and tv through my tv is speakers ( though to be fair , i always try to buy a tv with good sound )
i am content with the headphones that come with my sort of thing
so on the audio front , my opinion probably doesn not mean that much
that said , i could instantly tell that the sound on these was far better than my ipod headphones
it is as good as anything i can recall hearing
that is actually not why i bought these though
i work in a very loud environment
it seems to be over 70db , and i have long been concerned that it might be wrecking my hearing
i have tried using the ear protection gear i wear while mowing , but it is just not comfortable for long periods
i finally started wondering if a good pair of headphones that enclose your ears would help
and as it turns out , they do
these cut a significant amount of noise out , to the point that i am pretty sure they really are helpful for my hearing
not as much as the actual hearing protection stuff , but the difference in noise when i take them off after wearing them for a while is huge
i was also concerned about how comfortable these would be , given the mixed reviews in terms of comfort
at least for me , these are very comfortable
i have been wearing them every day , <NUM> hours a day , and have no complaints
i can feel them if i think about it , but the cushioning is soft and comfortable , and to me they just feel like they are gripping my head unlike how a hat feels , i guess
( for the record , i wear glasses , and these don not interfere with them at all
) so at any rate , they seem very well built , they sound great to my ear , they are comfortable , and they seem to block a substantial amount of noise
they are one of the few products that i can recommend wholeheartedly
well , i guess just to nitpick , the size adjustments on the side don not always stay in the same spot from where they were when i took them off the previous day , but that is really no big deal
they do have size adjustments though , which is worth noting
i have a big hats that fit is very , very hard , but these fit just fine , so i think they'd work for most people .
super high quality sound and for the price they can not be beaten
my friends all agreed these were the best headphones they have ever listened to .
if anyone tells you this are bad headphones they are lying to you big time ! this are some pretty good pair of headphonespros : sound is quite amazing everything pretty vivid on them a lil to high on the high freqs but its okay i like them ! they dont hurt your ears or crush your ears , you can wear them nicely for a few hours ( not more than <NUM> without removing them a lil bit for your ears to fresh out ) very well made its aluminium not cheap plastic like headphones this days , feels pretty sturdy and look quite coolcomes with a carrying bag which is fake leather or something doesnt feel that good but its a plus so you can carry your headphones around , they also fold so its easier to carryisolation is amazing at even half the full volume it doesnt leak at allcons : dont wear them for more then <NUM> hours in a row without taking them off a few minutes thats itim really happy with them i recommend it to anybody who wants to listen his music how it should
i got the as a gift and have had it for half a year
the sound quality is best of all headphones i have used
it is a bit uncomfortable because i wear prescription glasses
i have to take it off and relief my head after half hour is listening
but it is just a minor inconvenience
people who don not have eye glasses should have no issue at all .
first pair i bought got stolen outta my car , somebody smashed my window and took my bag that held it : ( anyway , first pair sounded great
i bought another pair , there was an extremely disappointing crackle in one of the headphones from a low frequency
this made me extremely annoyed/angry/disappointed
i cannot stand bad crap , and i hate to give bad product reviews
but i had to send it back and now i will look for a different company brand , probably for the rest of my life .
i don not know whether or not it is the is drivers or the is drivers that makes the slight difference in sound
both of these are excellent headphones
although the are an excellent choice and an industry standards , i thought the sound was a tad bit less full sounding than the is
it may just be that the sound pressure level ( ? ) was greater on the is since they have larger drivers
i am very impressed with both headphones , and i will most likely be doing the mastering of my musical projects with both headphones , as well as with my monitoring speakers ( event project studio <NUM> monitors , excellent ! ) .
these headphones are great
the quality is amazing , and the sound is crisp and clear
the style is professional and mature , not flashy
after trying on my friends' headphones like beats , skullcandys , or dnas , i have always felt that the sony is were better
they give you the sound that music artists want you to hear
( most recording studios use these headphones or the mdr <NUM> which i haven not tried yet ) the sturdiness of these headphones are amazing
i have stepped on them , sat on them , dropped them
and they are still fine
if you are looking for affordable , headphones you must get these or the mdr7506 is .
i have had my is so long , i can not remember when i bought them
at that time , they were highly recommended
they still are
that should tell you something
second recommendation : do you watch any concerts via dvd ? ever notice performers wearing a traditional set of headphones ? those pros are often wearing is ; they are distinctive , with a red horizontal stripe across the back of each driver
two issues : vinyl coating that flakes off the ear cups ; when it happens , just peel the rest off
the fuzzy fabric beneath ends up being more comfortable than the vinyl , since it 'breathes' and your ears stay cooler
electrostatic discharge ( zaps to your ears , in a dry wintry environment ) ; i fixed that , by removing one ear cup , and attached a fine brass wire loop that i grounded to the neutral wire that serves the l & r drivers
this fine wire shows / is visible inside the ear cup
in use , this rests on my ear ( not detectable as pressure on the ear ) and constantly drains off any static electricity buildup
bottom line : no more zaps ; so , ya want great headphones ? buy 'em and enjoy 'em .
i have used these headphones for a few months now and i felt it was time to finally write a review
i have used them for listening to music , watching videos , and playing computer games
the audio quality is very balanced and if anything the sound feels a little light or thin , but if you add bass through an equilizer , it will come through
they are extremely comfortable and i can wear them for long periods of time
i was impressed at first with how much they also deaden any external noise , too
the cord should be long enough for any setting and the storage bag is nice enough
overall , i don not regret this purchase at all and i would recommend them to a friend .
i owned the originals a couple of decades ago and was very pleased with them
these are virtually the identical head phones
my only complaint is that the very supple ear covers had a small slit right near the edge
this does not take away from my listening experience , so i still gave them <NUM> stars
the sound quality is still excellent , full range and neutral
i will always own a set of these
i was planning to buy the beyerdynamic edt <NUM> ear cushions anyway .
i have had a pair of these headphones for about <NUM> years
i have just bought another pair of these
before i bought my second pair , i tried bose and sennheiser headphones
some of them cost more than $300 per pair , but nothing beats these old sony headphones in sound quality .
this is probably the best money i have ever spent on
i originally bought a pair of v6 at best buy ten years ago
yes , ten years later they are still functioning well except the ear pad falling off and i replaced the ear pad
it sounds still amazing compare to a lot of phones i got in recent years - bose , even compare to b&w
this is definitely worth the sony brand
highly recommended !
excellent sound , of course these lack the base that we have in the new headphone we have now but i will still pick these over a beat or bose
the only thing i don not like is the long very long wire which make them more for home use headphone .
these headphones lasted <NUM> years total
the included muffs only lasted <NUM> year before they started slipping off very often and flaking
i bought a replacement for $20 and i thought i would be good
all of a sudden the left speaker stopped working , <NUM> years after the purchase date
i am not wasting my time with any more sony trash
save yourself some time and go with a better brand .
bought this item for use at the office at my cube
the sound production is very good
i have only tried it through my phone is music player using high bitrate mp3 is so not exactly the best source , so i am not going to dig too deep into sound quality
i will just say that i am happy with the sound production
on the comfort side , the cups are pretty comfortable
i have repeatedly worn these for an hour or so at a time and have not had any discomfort from my ears
the only slight discomfort i experienced was from the head band
i wish there was a little more padding so the band conformed more to my head
as it is , the band makes a pressure point at the top of my head which can be discomforting after awhile
but that could just be the shape of my head
in terms of manufacturering , the product feels quality made , from the band all the way down to the end of the plug
overall , i am happy with the purchase .
a nice camera
since the other reviews list all positives , letme list the downsides of picking this cameraup
does not include an ac adapter
the hp adapter costs a fortune ( $55 )
buy a cheaper sony 6v 700ma adapter as another reviewer notes
it will do the same thing for about $20
get nimh batteries and a charger ( target carries these ) otherwise you will soon begin to hate this machine , especially if you download pics to your pc a lot
this one includes no carrying case
consider the pdc <NUM> instead
this camera is a good quality hp one , but has a cheap plastic look to it
alternatives in the same $ range include the kodak dc215 for about $260
nice picture quality and easy to use
this unit doesn not include the external power supply , so i would buy one or a card reader for downloading the photos to your pc - or if you are buying a photo printer , too , the hp models ( 1000 , 1100 ) have a built in card reader
downloading drains the batteries quickly
i like the color lcd for reviewing your pictures and the megapixel resolution produces nice , photo quality shots with good detail .
it has been ten years since i purchased this camera and it is still working wonderfully
sure , these days my main camera is a <NUM> megapixel with 12x optical zoom and a staggering amount of features , but i still look back on my old hp c200 with fondness
it was , after all , my first digital camera
it also captured many , many , many memories over the decade
my old hp c200 still gets used these days as well
i use it for rugged outdoor activities that i don not want to expose my main camera to
its fully decked out with all the accessories that were prohibitively expensive or did not even exist in 1999 : <NUM> mah nimh rechargeable batteries , <NUM> mah nimh eneloop lsd batteries , 256mb cf , and even that ( then ) prohibitively expensive ac adapter that i paid $5 for
nostalgia .
this camera works fine
takes good pictures
drawbacks other than battery life : 1
only <NUM> pic review at a time as opposed to a collage review by the olympus brands
long delay from the time you hit the photo button and get a picture causes folks to relax before the pic is taken
ruins some shots
very clunky camera considering it has no optical zoom
now , the battery life
i have yet been able to fill my flash memory without having to change batteries
i get about <NUM> -15 pictures before it is flashing and beeping to tell me the battery is dead
this makes the camera unacceptable , and i am looking for a new one solely for this reason .
after reading the reviews here , i am perplexed
i have had major problems with this camera since day one
i bought the camera <NUM> months ago and : 1 ) the flash has stopped working , 2 ) the adapter plug will not stay in the socket which means i have to hold it in while i take pictures ( not easy to do ! ) or else tape it on and 3 ) the batteries only last long enough to take about <NUM> pictures
the quality of the photos are acceptable but using the camera is often a nightmare
i do not enjoy using it .
mine was manufactured in march 1996 , and according to the original owner was used pretty much daily
i have this beauty now , and with an hdtv converter connected via the available composite inputs , this set still outperforms modern hdtvs on every picture criteria other than raw resolution
my friends cannot believe the superb quality of the trinitron image after all these years
think a new flat panel tv will still be going after <NUM> years of hard use ?
this is one of the finest `' tvs from sony
all sony is 9inch tv sets have very sharp and crisp images
sony is dynamic picture processor and automatic white balance increases picture fidelity
however , the fact alone that this is a 9" inch set means that the electron gun has a very short distance to aim and deliver a precise image against the phosphor screen
the closer the electron gun is to the back of the tube is screen almost always guarantees a good picture
this picture is exceptionally crisp and sharp resulting in incredible fidelity .
this is one of the best 9" tvs i have ever seen
sony is 9inch tv sets are incredibly sharp
the reason is the 9" trinitron picture tube , its dynamic picture processor and automatic white balance
the picture is colorfully crisp and sharp
it makes vhs tapes and dvds look crystal clear and pinpoint precision sharp .
the picture on the sony is clear as a bell and very easy to see , even from several feet away
my only reservation about the set is how high i have to turn up the volume in order to hear it
this may be a function of its' sitting under a cabinet in a corner of my kitchen , but i really need to crank it
it also doesn not mask the static if i turn my satellite receiver off before the set ( my other sets do )
however , i like the set well enough that i am considering getting another one for my upstairs bathroom .
i owned the prior model , which was a pretty good set but had some nagging flaws ( buttons often broke , pushing the wrong button reset the picture to 'baseline' , which was awful )
this set has flush buttons that are water resistant , the picture is good every time , and even the automatic ( when muted ) is useful
the fm tuner is gone , but it wasn not that good anyway .
it is not sturdy at all
however , it does the job that i need it for
i would have purchased something stronger that didn not feel as if it would break if i dropped it or used it frequently
flimsy .
cassette tapes are on a comeback , so get yourself this awesome tape player and don not forget to buy some hammer pants and grow a mullet
they don not get any better than this , complete with mic/phone jacks , ac/dc power , built in speaker and mic , and a mechanical counter ! wow ! respect the books on tape !
with the purchase of a new car , i found that i had no way of playing my favorate cassette tapes
this works great and i use it in the house as well as on the road .
i made the mistake of buying a slightly cheaper ge recorder , with horrible sound
the sony is only a few dollars more and immensely better
very good sound reproduction , even using only the internal mic
automatic shutoff and a carrying handle are extra features which other units don not have .
i bought this for my wife use at school
she is a teacher and has a lot of cassette teaching tapes
she asked to research for safe and good quality device
using this sony at school makes her happy
the device has nice design to play old cassette tapes
it is simple , stable , and safe .
i bought this unit for two reasons
1 ) to play books on tape , and 2 ) for dictation
i am visually impaired , so when i need to type from printed material , or enter store receipts , i first record myself reading , and then type while the machine dictates to me
this is not the machine for playing stereo music cassettes ( you can , but it won not sound great - it is too small , and is not stereo )
if you just want a basic cassette recorder with big easy buttons , and no extras to get in the way , this is the one
in fact , i have owned several of these , and they are very dependable and .
works as spec'd
it does what it said it would do
what more can i say
that is my whole review .
the following was a consequence to reckon with ( then came the digital age )
sony had the best internal microphone of any boom box , and too bad i once damaged the record side is tape door with a koosh ball a dozen years ago
soon got rid of it , but never forgot how great sony is level of quality was for $80 at the local acme store back then
unfortunately , today , it is probably scarce as hen is teeth in the hope in finding one , if you are a fan of vintage recording equipment
let is talk about the
its microphone is as sensitive as the boom box mentioned above , and it erases and records just as well on high bias and normal bias tape
the boom box had a magnet erase head , whereas the shoebox has a black magnet erase head
( the story about identifying erase heads' capabilities is unique and personal
) here are the pluses and minuses ( and read my review on the )
pros : - tape counter- internal microphone ( try external microphone for cleaner sound ) - erases and records almost equally on normal bias and high bias- battery life nearly as long on nimh batteries as on alkaline ( duracell or energizer ) - well built- runs on included household adapter ( sound quality unaffected , unlike the ) - great price for its features ( $30 at the local best buy back in the day ) cons : - would be more efficient ( but maybe slightly more bulky ) on <NUM> c batteries instead of <NUM> aa- severe dc bias effect ( distorted is' and not' sound , do we know ) - records below optimum on metal bias ( partial erasure over previous recording ) - scratchy sound through speaker , especially after several years of use ( a common problem with units of this league ) this recorder won not fit in your pocket , but has a retractable handle , making it easier to carry
i would recommend this recorder , especially since i have owned it twice ( the first one broken by experimentation in <NUM> and the second one i still use regularly have had since 2000 ) .
the sony pressman desktop cassette recorder with automatic is a pretty good--maybe even very good--tape recorder in this price range
i like the fact that it takes the traditional old fashioned type of tape recorder and improves upon it
we get features like a microphone jack , a headphone jack--and there is even automatic shutoff for when we can not be there right at the exact minute the tape stops playing ! the handle also makes for easy portability ; this can be used to record just about any sound
words , music , lectures and conversations , you name it
the buttons are easy to read and understand ; there is practically no explanation needed for the five or six buttons in the front of the tape recorder that handle features including play , fast forward and rewind
the pause and eject buttons work reliably , too
great ! just as amazon notes , there is also a microphone and speaker--but if you want a very clear voice recording there is a microphone jack so that people can get a very good recording of their thoughts right onto that cassette tape
it even comes with an ac adapter ! if you need to carry this around and you can not plug it into an electrical outlet , just use the four aa batteries you will need for roughly eight hours of usage
of course , if you use strong batteries you may get up to nine or even ten hours usage ; i think eight hours is slightly too short for what you will get out of battery usage
one thing i must tell you--as i am sure you can imagine , this isn not exactly the world is most durable tape recorder
after all , the price is very good for people in all income brackets
what does this mean ? it means that i wouldn not bang it around or let small children play with it unsupervised
if dropped it could well break and that would be a shame
handle with care for the maximum life of this tape recorder ! another caveat : although they say it records lectures well , i am not sure just how well it will be able to record a professor is lecture unless you are rather close to the professor when they talk
this occurs simply because it is not capable of picking up voices and nuances of words from larger distances
i will have to take off one star for this to make this a four star review
believe me , i tried to use this for my continuing education spanish classes ; and i was disappointed
i was not able to get a consistently clear recording of what the teacher had said
good thing i took notes just in case this failed me on that score ! one way to possibly get around this is to ask the teacher if you can place the tape recorder on their desk while they lecture ; maybe that will work if your teacher doesn not mind
overall , this is one fine tape recorder for everyday use and less demanding tasks like recording your own thoughts
it records especially well when you use a microphone that plugs into the machine instead of using the built in microphone
if you are looking for a good tape recorder in this price range and you don not need extremely features , this tape recorder is for you !
i agree with all the other reviews of this item
exactly right for the price
i use it primarily to listed to books on tape that can not be gotten on cd , and it does the job perfectly .
while these recorders are considered "old fashioned" by electronic geeks , they are very useful for those of us who just want to use the counters and go to specific areas of a tape
mine paid for itself in the first <NUM> minutes of a legal deposition when i jogged the momory of a forgetful witness with his own words on tape
he still insisted he couldn not remember anything , but had to admit it was his voice and that he -- being the model of honesty and truth -- must have been trying to tell the truth when he spoke
very effective , these "" recorders .
since getting rid of my rarely used tape deck i needed to have something that i could use to occasionally play cassette tapes
this fits the bill perfectly .
for $10
what a deal
i write songs and play guitar and it is handy to record the music ( at the moment )
sound quality as expected is mediochre
i did record a financial message from my speaker phone ( panasonic ) handset
very good
this alone justifies this recorder
i will have to record from this to a digital hand recorder to check out the quality
digital is not everything
but almost
i have had one of these since 1993
it is perfect
it is a tape player and recorder , and that is it
it never jams on a good tape
it is perfect at what it does
being an audiobook lover i use it to listen to my books around the house and it has had a lot of use ! unlike units that have cd players , the tape is the focus , not an afterthought
also , it is far superior to tape units that switch sides for you , because they often switch sides at the least resistance , not necessarily the end of the tape
in summation , this is the tape audiobook listener is friend for reliable , no trouble , listening for hours and hours and years to come .
this device does what it was intended to do , record and play
it has performed adequately as expected
i haven not gone wrong with any sony product , yet .
i searched the web to find something that i could use to record the songs that i receive
i needed something quick and easy to use
i have gone through countless cd/cassette players that break down within a year
plus , to find one now that has a built in mic is almost impossible , so i was very happy to find this product
i have only had it for a few weeks , but so far it has been a
the minute i hear a song forming within my mind i can quickly grab the unit , flip it on and i am set to go
great ! no more lost songs floating around the atmosphere but now they are safe on my cassette until i am ready to transfer them
it is also great to use during church meeting when you want to be able to record either the sermon or some other happening so you can reflect back on it at a later time
my granddaughter had fun recording her voice the other day and other sounds as well
this little guy has countless uses and it is sturdy , well made and very easy to use
i like it and will write another review in a year and let you know how well it held up to the often use it will definitely receive .
i have been using this almost daily and love it
i use rechargeable batteries and get many hours of play out of each charge
i love it because it is portable and i can easily take my audio book with me
prompt shipping as always .
was exactly what was needed to get an older version of a sony camera to work for my daughters camera
memory was what was advertised and great price
thanks .
i had to return this one as it was the wrong size for my camera
im sure its a good product though as i got one just like it of the right size .
if you shoot low res pix only ( 640x480 ) , you will get about <NUM> pix out of this memory stick , which isn not a bad amount of pix , but it also means you are shooting low resolution
if you are only taking pix for the web , that is great , and this memory stick will get you pretty far
but , if you are hoping to print your images out , you will want to shoot higher resolution , which means the 16mb memory stick isn not quite big enough if you are hoping to go out on a trip ( unless you buy a few of them )
i recommend at least a 32mb memory stick
as with all sony products , this is , of course , well made and solid , and works like a charm
just make sure you know how much memory you need , and then buy more , always .
you sent me the wrong item
the item you sent me was suppose to go to mr
feliz birdi
wroong item/i really don not know what your going to do .
well , i got this with my camera ( ) , and i have to say it is pretty weak
for low resolution pictures ( vga ) and low resolution videos ( 160 ) , no , this memory stick is the perfect buy
but , if you like your pictures and videos high quality and full screen , don not even think about buy this memory stick
on low setting pictures ( vga ) , you get i think <NUM> pictures , and on low setting videos ( 160 ) i think you get about <NUM> and a half minutes
however , on medium setting pics ( 4 ) you get only <NUM> pics and on medium setting video ( 640 standard ) you only get <NUM> seconds to be exact
you should be saying that is ridiculous ! but , for people who don not really care much about quality or resolution , this is a perfect buy for you , though , if you like medium/high quality and high resolution pics and vids , i recommend the 256mb memory stick ( ) .
i was first peeved about having to but stuck with a predetermined sony memory stick format
but after continued use in trv900 , trv11 video cams and the sony clie pda- i have to say i am very happy with the memory stick is flexibility
i usually hate being stuck in a specific company format , but at least sony did it right
the transfer rate in the clie is very rapid
backing up the entire contents of the clie takes literally a few seconds
the clie has a program that allows you run programs off of the memory stick
this is not the fastest operating speed , but it is no worse than a zip drive disk
the size and reliability is unbeatable
compared to a san memory card that has lost it is life after <NUM> year , the sony memory sticks have performed flawlessly for pics , data , and application runs
these smaller mb sizes aren not fair for the price
go for the 32+ mb and up - just like a hard drive , you think a realistic amount is adequate
but once you start shooting and using , you will wish you upgraded for the bigger stick .
the <NUM> stars is arbitrary
this is no top end table such as rega
but for the price it is decent and i have found the speed to be steady
most of my music playing is cd is
i pretty much only buy vinyl music not available on cd
if you are an audiophile who plays a lot of vinyl this is not the table for you .
i have an old late 70s sony with a carbon fiber tonearm and fully automatic arm functions
this one does not have all of those features
but it tracks beautifully , speed is consistent , and the furnished audio technica cartridge is adequate
of course the first thing i did was change out the cartridge to a shure m97xe and now it makes me remember why i liked the sound of vinyl
cd is and mp3s are ok but with this turntable and the shure cartridge you can really tell the difference ! my records are being played again and the sound is terrific !
a nice playing turntable , simple in design easy to use
a real treat if you have some lp is that are nice scratched
i have had this for several years it always works
put in a sure cartridge nice needle , not the cheap thing it comes with
hook it up to a nice receiver yamaha <NUM> and some infinity speakers love vinyl wow a blast from the past is good
hey i have an ipod it is not the same
happy trails
the sony ps lx350h is a good entry point into the "retro" world of good sounding vinyl if you are tired of somewhat "mechanical" and less than "open" sounding cd is and other digital formats
this turntable is totally manual ! cool if you don not mind "tweaking" the notable every so often
the unit itself is pretty <NUM> very you want for full sounding analog
the pitch control works great once you get the motor in the so called owner is manual
the <NUM> and <NUM> motor speed adjustments are on the bottom
the supplied cartridge sounds pretty once you properly align point omitted in the "manual
" if you overlook the sparse info in the manual and take your time setting it up you will be rewarded with a surprisingly good sounding system ! if you can get this notable on sale you won not be disappointed
don not forget it is not and doesn not pretend to be the equivalent of a thorens , music hall , rega or other high end unit
the bottom line is this table is a good sounding good deal !
purchased a sony to replace <NUM> technics belt drive turntable
the sony appears to be one of the few reasonably high quality options for an audio ( as opposed to &quot ; dj&quot ; ) turntable in the sub-$200 ( or even sub-$300 ) price range
if it runs as long as the technics , will be quite a buy - for now this must be considered a &quot ; preliminary&quot ; report ( ! )
picks : looks good ( &amp ; matches other sony components in system ) ; appears to be solidly built ( &amp ; comparatively heavy ) ; rca plugs with removable cables ( a nice feature ! - although cables themselves do not have gold plating , they can easily be replaced ) ; strobe w/slider pitch control ; platter/mat combo appear higher quality than technics
nits : gee , manuals have gotten cheap looking &amp ; provide sparse information ! where is the overhang guide ? cheap &quot ; &quot ; cartridge ( conical , bonded diamond ) , not properly mounted in included headshell ( overhang / alignment guide would be helpful
notes : this is &quot ; manual&quot ; turntable : you lower &amp ; raise the tonearm manually
not as nice as &quot ; , &quot ; where you lower but turntable raises at end of lp
manual is ok for 'active listening' - but you won not want to forget about a playing lp
at least the arm lifter works well - smooth in operation &amp ; easy to control
it also has an &quot ; s&quot ; shaped tone arm , which takes a standard mount cartridge
might be more convenient , but there is more choice avail in std mount - plus , i have two fine cartridges , each mounted in own headshell ( will use the cartridge to play really old lps / children is records ! ) - and , can use existing overhang/alignment tool
there is no built in phono amp/equalizer , an issue for many modern 'home theater' receivers
( but you can buy an unit at moderate cost if needed
) how does it work ? just fine , - using one of my existing cartridges , played parts of several lps &amp ; was rewarded with crisp sound &amp ; no obvious noise ( at realistic , but still moderate , listening levels )
may not sound any better than the old technics did at one time , but speed control appears spot on &amp ; songs sound as they &quot ; should&quot ; ( subjective , of course ! )
controls all appear to work with precision , and strobe marks are easy to read / adjust
two nits here : 1 ( minor ) : start/stop button can be hit by mistake - but care should avoid ; <NUM> ( more irritating ) : control is poorly marked : you basically just it if setting between whole numbers
( tracking force instructions are not intuitive - at least compared to technics - but if you have done before will pose no problems
) these last two items are only of significant concern if you plan to switch cartridges on a routine basis ( alas , something i traditionally do )
oh yes : the unit is taller than my technics : so much so that there was no hope of using it with the supplied
unit is placed inside a cabinet , so cover not needed in this case , but might be an issue if your space is tight and you 'must' use
bottom line : only the poor markings on the control are truly disappointing , and then primarily because of usage within cabinet , and personal preference of changing cartridges on a frequent basis
( cabinet location makes setting doubly hard to confirm : if you can view from directly above , 'ballpark' will be very close , but placement within cabinet calls for flashlight &amp ; mirror ; will have to work in this ! ) the balance of the unit seems to work fine , and certainly sounds fine - which basically means that it doesn not add noise / speed inaccuracies , nor otherwise impede working of selected cartridge
to that extent , it is all that one could hope for , and looks good to boot
other units considered included : new technics belt drive ; music hall ; stanton ; gemini , &amp ; several others ( at least &quot ; looked at&quot ; everything i could find in the sub-$500 range - though budget never called for exceeding $400
if you eliminate the cheap &quot ; impulse buy&quot ; models - which includes some brand name items , such as the 'entry' technics - and draw a fairly strict upper price point ( say , under $300 ) , there are not a lot of choices left
now specify standard mount cartridge , and focus upon basic audio performance and controls - as opposed to &quot ; dj&quot ; performance &amp ; controls - and your choices really narrow
the sony is arguably the best among those that remain , although differing priorities could yield a different alternative .
title says it all
these are very low quality cables and the female end is a joke
look for ones that actually cover the male end you plug in and not this cheesy aluminum end like this one has
<URL> is the cable i went to and it rocked
worked perfect for reasonable price
you will be glad you read this post
god bless
i bought this product to extend my web camera and it works great
the product is as described and the price was right
easy to use
i will buy again and recommend this to everyone .
i am not a big fan of the exposed connector on the female end , but i can not complain much on a &<HASHTAG> ; $5 cable that feels pretty durable .
it is exactly as described
it works good & have not had any troubles with it .
that such an excellent piece of equipment could be areviewed' by persons that are computer challenged
these jokers should seek help before buying a product and writing negative reviews because they bought the wrong product ! geez ! this usb extension cable has performed beyond my expectations for over <NUM> months
there has been no noticeable [at least not to me] degradation in performance to my accessories [digital camera , webcam and jumpdrive ] by using this extension cord and it means that i do not have to be fiddling behind or leaning down in front of the computer to attach and detach the equipment
it is a great buy !
i purchased this extension cable to allow me to sit on my couch and still use my gaming headset on my ps3
it works prefect for that , i have had no problems with it and do not foresee any either .
i recently bought a cheap dollar tree usb and i kept gettingusb device unrecognized message in windows
no problems with this wire
very fast and good length
this wire is plugged into a hub which is also connected with same usb wire
no problems one month later .
this is a simple extension cable that works great for things like extending a keyboard or mouse
i used it for that purpose and had no trouble
if you need a longer extension you will need and active version .
sub standard cables , not the belkin quality i have come to expect
it took almost <NUM> weeks to get them , and now that i have tried both of the cables i am not impressed with the quality of the product or the shipper
a consistent connection is iffy at best , not like the other cables that i currently have , so the problem is not with my system it is with the cables
when i finally received them , the plastic package had yellowed
so these units were either old or had been exposed to sunlight for a long period of time
save your time and money , order them from somebody else .
needed a us extension cable so i could extend my iphone charger
( the outlet is on the floor ) now i can plug one end of this cable into the charger/outlet and leave it there , then loop the cable behind and onto my desk and plug in my charger ! now my charger could reach my phone/desk
works perfect to extend any usb charger ! only gripe is the price
wish it was a tad cheaper , hence the <NUM> stars .
i almost bought it but checked the speed right before i hit the purchase button
the <NUM> mbit speed means it is usb 1
that is about <PERCENT> of the speed of usb 2
it will not work in many applications
you can get a good usb 2
0 cable for the same price .
good quality cable , feels durable , works as described
well made
good buy
the price is also acceptable as well
not quite sure if it is usb 1
0 or 2
will check when i get back .
their isn not much you can say about a cord , but this one is well made , and it does what it is supposed to do
i have a keyboard , a yamaha mm6 that i wanted to attach to my computer , so i can record through cubase le
i started tripping over the standard size cord , so i added this belkin extension , and now it is safely tucked away
sure beats having to replace the usb port in the computer from abuse
belkin makes nice stuff , and this is one of those things that they make well
highly recommended .
first of all , i the cable i got does not look like the one pictured , it is a more plain looking usb cable end
the construction is solid , and it usually works on most of my devices , although some of my friends have trouble getting their phones and ipods to charge when it is connected to a wall adapter
other than that , it is very convenient to be able to move around my room without leaving my phone by the wall to charge .
sometimes usb chords are just too short
this chord has given me room to p ; lay with
it seems to be sturdy , and reliable
i would recommend it .
i apparently already had one and purchased another a few days ago
although the box states <NUM> mbps on the front , on the back of the package it lists that it has been tested with high speed devices
also , on belkin is website , it also states the cable is 2
0 a quick call to belkin confirmed that it is 2
0 compatible .
extension for gaming console duty
replacing a worn out extension cable , these seem to only last about a year or so before they get flaky
rated one star short because the female end is not overmolded ( could have sworn the image showed that when i made the selection ? ! ? )
still a good deal and its a brand name cable
will probably buy more in a year or so
this same cable sells for over $20
00 at local electronics stores
not only was this an incredible buy , but customer contact was professional and consistent
i will certainly purchase here again - look out fort worth !
i needed a new usb extension cable and all of the local options , such as walmart were about $20
after searching on line i found the belkin cables through amazon a very good price so i purchased <NUM> of them so that i would have some on hand for the future
basically i got <NUM> cables for about the price of one purchased locally .
i needed an extension cable so i could use a usb controller with my pc
the whole idea was so i could play emulated video games from my couch rather than from my chair ( my computer is already connected to my television )
this cable performs exactly like i need it to with no problems .
needed an extension cord to be able to more widely use my webcam ( it came with an unbelievably short cord )
i can now take my webcam around almost my entire room without issues at all .
received item as advertied
it works very well as an extension cable should
also received the item very promptly , thanks !
the usb extension cable works great
i purchased four of these for my xbox <NUM> and rock band and guitar hero games ( i prefer the wired setup to the wireless )
the cables work just as you would expect
no surprises here , but any surprise would mean bad things .
yes , it is <NUM> feet long , and works
it extends a usb device cable so that it can reach your computer or usb hub
not much else this thing can do
i like the gray !
this cord is great
works well and is plenty long enough to suit my needs
no problems with this item .
a <NUM> foot usb extension may seem like it is too long but i find i use it all of the time
i mostly use it next to my bed connected to a wall charger to charge my ipod touch
the next available outlet is just out of reach for the supplied charging cord and the long extension allows me to route the cable out of the way so that i don not trip over it if i get up in the dark .
this product was shipped very quickly and received in excellent condition
it was perfect for my purpose of connecting my pc to my tv
i highly recommend this product .
usb cable was dead on arrival
not cool considering i ran it through a wall
today is lesson : test your cords before running them .
my flip video ultra series camcorder wouldn not connect using this cable
i purchased a flip video ultra series camcorder along with this belkin usb extension cable
my computer ( dell running xp pro ) wouldn not recognize the usb device ( flip ultra ) using this cable
the flip connected immediately when plugged directly into the usb port
belkin is a reputable supplier but this cable got just <NUM> star for my application .
since i am functionally illiterate in computer tech , it took a while to find the cable 'extension cord' i needed to relocate my canon mf <NUM> printer
with enough length to snake around the back of a wide bookcase and across a desk , the cable allowed an easy move
there is even room for relocating further from the pc
nice ! the connection was easily made and performance is seamless
never a glitch or interruption
to reiterate some of the other reviewers' point : this is an extension cable , akin to an extension cord
unlike an extension cord , however , length matters
be sure you have chosen the proper footage for your application
on a final note , the price is exceptional
lesser quality extension cables ( if you can find 'em ) at brick and mortar retailers are ridiculously overpriced
this belkin product helps efficiently utilize space in my small home office
in my opinion , this extension cable is just perfect .
nothing outstanding about this that separates it from any generic cable you can buy - i was just in a hurry to get something , and this was at the top of the list .
i have bought multiple of these
they are great to extend a phone charger
i have them on all of my chargers
they have aged well also !
works great
i have been able to extend my gaming laptop to a custom setup over my zero gravity chair
now i can get up and move to my desk without interuption .
when you shop for cables and other electronic adapters , all you want is for them to do what you need them to do
these cables and adapters do just that
no problems , no hassles .
product worked well for my needs
the price i paid was very good compared to a retail store
shipping was on time
packaged very well
good by for the money .
unfortunately , this cable is too long to carry a power charge sufficient for a external hard drive or to use as an extension to a car charger for a phone or ipod
it also will not be compatible with a powered usb hub either - i haven not tried it with an unpowered one
however , it is useful for peripherals such as mice and keyboards at least .
nothing fancy here
i ordered two of these <NUM> foot usb extenders and they do exactly that , extend my usb devices
awesome .
nothing like being able to extend a short apple cable and not lose any data transfer highly suggest you pick one or two up
used this to extend usb from keyboard to computer - works well - no problems - only need <NUM> more words
this product works very well
i am presently using it with my keyboard
i have no problems with it
i highly recommend this product .
nothing amazing to say here but the product works exactly how you would want it to
belkin is always a good brand so you can not go wrong especially at this price
: )
due to my computer setup , i needed a usb extension cord
i shopped many stores in my area and the price was $35-$40 either of monster cable ( also known as the "i am a yuppie and have too much money burning a hole in my pocket" brand ) or of indeterminate quality
i was not going to drop money in that range for something that might have cost fifty cents in china to make and i was not going to enable a corporation like monster , who i feel is fleecing consumers with technological snake oil
i found this cable from belkin , a very reliable company
the insulation & connectors are high quality
the wire feels of a decent enough gauge to last many years
this is a real value for money purchase
if you need one , you are not risking anything buying this cable
i deducted one star due to the fort knox like clam shell packaging of heavy duty plastic that you will have to attack with a box cutter to free your purchase
if they has a security pull tab to make retrieval of the product easier , i would have rated this a full five stars .
amazon list this as in stock i placed order 10/21/ and used 2nd day shipping its 10/29 and just shipped , amazon upgraded shipping to next day , big help when it takes a week and a half to get order
my daughter borrowed and misplaced the cable that came with my hotspot
she knows i have a collection and asked if i had another , i did
this one is the backup now
she loves to have and use technology but has no understanding of it
i used to do this stuff for a living , so everyone comes to me
well , she and the hotspot are on good standing again
and , guess what ? the darned original cable resurfaced a few days after the replacement was put in place
go figure !
exactly what it says it is
it works !
if you are looking for a basic 10' usb extension cable , you have come to the right place
belkin is products have always been reliable , and this one is no different
the belkin is a 10' usb cable , a plug to a receptacle
i use mine on an older pc that only has usb ports on the back of its tower
thanks to this cable , i no longer need to climb under furniture to insert my usb memory key
if you plan to use this cable to extend a shorter cable , be aware of recommended usb cable length limits
devices ( e
mice and keyboards ) should not exceed cable lengths of 10' , while usb devices such as scanners and printers should be limited to a total cable length of <NUM> feet
if you plan to extend your current usb cable beyond these limits , consider getting a repeating cable such as the belkin active extension usb cable
perhaps the best reason to buy this usb cable from amazon is to get their hefty discount on belkin products
you will pay about a third what you would at your local electronics store
now that is a bargain !
no honestly it works fine
not much more to say other than its a long cord
so you can move to another room if you want
i bought this so that i could use my webcam a little farther from the computer but it doesn not work
i see warnings that <NUM> feet is the limit for usb cables , and with the webcam cable it comes to a total of 15 , so i guess i am on the cusp or something
ah well , they are cheap enough that i will just save it and maybe i can use it some other way , not worth returning
no complaints at all about the seller , mind you .
i have used this for years now and it is never stopped working
both ends are , as is the wire in between .
i am using it to increase the length of some short usb cables
for instance iphone <NUM> has too short cable to charge from wall outlet
i want my phone to lie on my table while it is charging
and this extension cable helps me with that !
i recently purchased an inexpensive webcam , which came with a long usb cord
obviously whoever manufactured it intended the cord to reach from the pc monitor/lcd to the back of the computer , and nothing more
this was unacceptable
&<HASHTAG> ; p&<HASHTAG> ; luckily i browsed around and found this cable , which was a lifesaver
it is got a female &<HASHTAG> ; a&<HASHTAG> ; plug on one side and a male &<HASHTAG> ; a&<HASHTAG> ; plug on the other , effectively working as an &<HASHTAG> ; extension cord&<HASHTAG> ; ( to be plugged in the middle , between your pc and one of your existing usb cables that is attached to your usb device )
very good quality cables
inexpensive price
to paraphrase jerry pournelle on the legendary byte magazine : &<HASHTAG> ; recommended ! &<HASHTAG> ;
: )
not much to say
it is a usb extension cord
i have had it for a while and used it for a few different devices and it has worked great on all of them , from an iphone plugged into the wall to allowing me to relocate my printer to a more convenient area
it is pretty solidly built as well , with thick rubber housings on the connections and a thick cable sleeve .
this cable works
haven not had it long , but big surprise
chances are , whatever you pay on amazon will be a lot less than your local retailer .
great price and good quality , belkin is always dependable
the length is perfect for some temporary work areas and i have used it many times .
okay it works fine .
i purchased this to extend a usb cable in order to plug the cable into a wall charger instead of the pc
very sturdy cable .
not much to say
it is a usb extension cord
plugs fit perfectly
will update this review if the cord ever fails .
does the job is a good value for the money i would recommend it to anyone needing one better than the stores .
i am usually very "details aware" but i also did not realize that this was usb <NUM> and not usb <NUM> capable .
i bought this to extend a printer cable
i always buy belkin because of superior quality
this cable extension works perfectly
i am very pleased , and at such a great low price .
i like mine it gives me just a little extra cord for my key board .
really great cable if you need to use a usb device that is a distance away from the pc
i was using this for a usb cell modem and it worked flawlessly
we are now using this cable for attaching other devices and it is working great .
it is a usb &<HASHTAG> ; extender , &<HASHTAG> ; meaning it will &<HASHTAG> ; extend&<HASHTAG> ; your current usb cable ( like an extension cord for usb cables
) in that respect , it performs very well
no problems to report , does what i need it to do .
works great
i needed this extension cable to extend a usb computer keyboard cable
the cable works great , no problems
belkin is a well know name for quality cabling .
if it works , i love it
this works
this 10' cable extends a normal cable
looks good
works fine
belkin makes some really good cables
i have always used them and never been disappointed .
i have purchased several belkin cables and they always seem to be well made
only problem with this particular cable is that it is not usb 2
0 which i didn not realize when i bought it
i had intended to attach it to another cable which i purchased at the same time
according to the instructions , it is not advisable
the mistake was completely mine
i just didn not think to check for usb 2
0 when i purchased it .
its your standard usb extension cable
quality was very good , then ends were molded for durability
time will tell how well its made .
as usual with belkin products , this cable works great and is quality made
i got it to be able to charge my turtle beach xp400 headset while i am using them , since the only plug i can use that won not be in the way is behind the couch on the other side of the living room
it works great , keeping me in the game longer
definitely a great buy
i would recommend this cable .
good cable , serve it purpose
i also use it to extend the range on my lightning cable to charge my iphone <NUM>
i recently had to move my computer
in doing so i used this usb cable to extend the reach of my mouse
what i like most about belkin usb cables is that they don not pull apart at the joints as easily as the other less expensive ones !
works well , with no signal glitches
for an electronic device extensioncable that is a big deal
it carries a good , strong signal .
i use this to extend the receiver of a wireless presentation remote
works great and by a reputable company
it replaced one that i purchased online that stopped working when i dropped it out of a window accidentally
( ironically , the wireless receiver didn not break when it hit the floor , just the usb extender - so i bought this to replace it
this usb extension is just what i was hoping it would be
i bought a usb scanner recently , and i wanted it placed on top of a shelf away from my computer
this cord solved the distance problem with ease
i have noticed no change in the scanners performance since adding this extension cable .
was using this for my printer to hook up to my laptop , worked fine for awhile but for some reason it stopped working
my laptop does not recognize printer when i use this
i am getting a different one arriving tomorrow , hope it lasts longer
i am surprised because i like belkin products .
the cables work great
i like the quality and i haven not had a problem with them at all
thanks for a quality and fair priced product .
i ordered the usb extension cable so i could use a usb headset for ps3
this works perfectly with no distortion or static
very good price ( radio shack = $30
00 ! )
i connect a usb item to these cables and , maybe , %25 of the time it works
i have to fiddle with it to really get any connection
i have older , worn out cables that work better than these .
inexpensive compared to cables at best buy
does exactly what it is supposed to do !
these work exactly as expected
i tested data transfer speeds with and without the extension cable and there was no difference
simple plug and play
they say not go longer than <NUM> feet for low speed devices and <NUM> feet for high speed devices
for kicks i plugged two cables in for a total of <NUM> feet ( 4 foot external hard drive cable plus two <NUM> feet extensions ) and there was no speed difference or loss of data
if you need an extension , these work perfectly .
while i am sure the cable works fine , be careful about what you need it for
i too thought i was buying a usb cable that i could connect two computers
i believed this because it is an "a/a" extension cable
indeed , the key word is "extension
" normally , "a/a" would mean the same type of connector but not in this case .
not much you can really add to such a device as an extension cable
they either work or they don not and these two do
so i am happy
if you need to extend your usb device then these is a great purchase .
it is a cable
it was cheap
why pay big prices for the gold plated extra special ones when this will do the job .
it is a good extension from a good brand and you can not beat the price
why is limited to 1
1 we may never know
great for ps3 controllers and whatnot
be sure you don not need it for anything that requires speed ( external drive etc ) , or you will be waiting for a while
at first i thought it was from the 90s or something , but it does say <NUM> on the packaging
in what universe do they still make usb 1
1 speed accessories in 2012 ? for that ; you get three of em
i needed a long extension to properly position my wireless networking dongle and this cable fits the bill
i have found that belkin cables are of high quality , at least by my standards
<NUM> ft
is more than i need really , but it is nice to have
be advised this is not a usb 2
0 cable and many devices require one
also , this is an extension , not a printer cable
some devices will not work at all or will not perform properly with a 10ft
usb cable and belkin gives you a small list of these devices on the packaging
the amazon price is less than half what my local stores want for the same exact cable and i am happy with my purchase .
works well
i used this as part of a ( )
a strainer served as a receiver dish , and boosted my signal , since my home is not completely reach my shop , unassisted .
i use this cable in conjunction with abelkin usb 2
0 ultra mini huband all my usb peripherals work ( mouse , external seagate hard drive , hp printer ) as expected
of course you can not *power* devices through an extension cable and hub so i don not connect mywestern digital my passport essentialthrough it
note that the product states that using usb extension cables past a certain length may result is problems using your peripherals that aren not designed to be used with very long cables so you use according to your own risks , but as i said before i haven not had any problems .
needed a usb extension cable for a kvm that i purchased
always had good luck with belkin products and this one didn not disappoint .
seems to be a high quality cable
i am very satisfied .
this works for the practical things such as printers and keyboards
however , if you need to connect something that is data heavy and requires the use of usb 2
0 , such as an external hard drive or a hd camera , you need to look elsewhere
that being said , the high price disappoints me for such old technology
although , it overall depends on what you need it for .
this cable works just like it should
i use it to have an extension on my wii controllers when i play without needing any movement
that way they stay charged while i waste my life away .
item received was not belkin branded
cable also did not work , all items show up as not recognized
this seller needs to be investigated
the seller is purposefully ordering fake cables and selling them as name brand ( with the name brand price to boot ) i can understand this happening once but with so many complaints about the same issue , and me getting the same issue , this seller is clearly engaging in false advertising and judging by how far this goes back , they most likely know about it and choose to do nothing about it
( seems amazon does not list the most recent reviews under the product description )
the cable i received is not a belkin cable
it is a cheap no name cable
the picture is of a gray cable with the belkin name molded in the plastic ends
i received a cheap thin plain black cable in a clear plastic bag with the made in china sticker
it was sold by "marginmart inc" and fulfilled by amazon
i feel i was lied to and ripped off .
the cable itself is good , looks durable and works fine
the only thing i don not like is the color
it is kind of gray , so it looks old .
i have used this when using the ipad ( and obviously had it plugged in ) and it still runs the battery down , just slower than it would have otherwise
it is ok but there have got to be others out there that will work better
i mean , belkin makes some great products but this is not top of the list
i use it and its ok but i would really like to find a <NUM> foot ipad cord that actually works and not rely on thsi thing
when your computer is plugged in , it should not run down to <PERCENT> when being used
so , based on that
i consider this product kind of a failure and the only reason it gets <NUM> stars is that i actually do use it
this usb extension cable works as described
one end of the cable has a female usb adopter to accept a regular male usb connector .
sometimes you might wonder , "you know , the usb cable that came with this cell phone/controller/hard drive/other things is not long enough ; i could something to extend its reach
" i know where you are coming from , and i figured you would consider something like this
here , i bought one ; here is my take on things
the cable came in a plastic bubble , tightly coiled around to fit in as small a plastic bubble as it possibly can
the color is a little darker than you would see in the picture , but then you are not buying this because it looks pretty
and it might look darker due to my room lighting
the build quality looks quite good
while it does not have anything fancy like a woven sleeve or led , it feels as though it can handle years of service
you can see , though , that the female side of the cable is not very protected ; in fact , it looks like a mutated male part
it is sturdy as well , trust me , but it would have been better if it were protected by the plastic that surrounded the lower part of the connector
it might accumulate more debris and dirt than it would otherwise , but i have not used this long enough to go through such an endeavor and live to tell the tale
it works marvelously in conjunction with shorter cables
i had a a to mini b cable , which worked very well
i also had a cable of the same kind , so i tried that--but the cable did not let the signal go through
there is a label on one end of the cable : " not exceed ten feet of total cable distance on device or sixteen feet on high speed devices
" this was usb 2
0 hard drive--a high speed device
sixteen feet was maximum length allowed , and this cable itself is <NUM> feet long , so any moderately long cable is going to strain the signal that tries to go to and from the device
it is a great product , but it puts a lot of the cables suddenly to the edge of usability
i would recommend its use with shorter ( 3 feet and under ) usb cables
otherwise , you might be better off getting a shorter extension cable , or an active usb cable liketripp lite usb2
0 certified active extension cable .
the cable arrived today and i was surprised to find that it is an usb 1
1 extension cable
that is why so many other reviewers found that it didn not work with their devices , since most current devices need usb 2
0 spec cables
i elected to return my cable to amazon for a refund
they said no need to return it , they will just give the refund
moral : if a usb cable does not explicitly state that it is usb 2
0 ( or usb 3
0 ) then it is probably a usb 1
1 cable that won not support most of today is peripherals
note : i knew this already , but people should take note that a usb extension cable can only be used together with another usb cable , to extend the length of the connection
it is not suitable for directly connecting a device to your computer without that normal cable .
now i can plug my ipad in almost anywhere in my home
what a great find
very happy with this product .
well made cable that i am using to extend my web cam is distance from my cpu so i can have a wider view of the room .
i have always been impressed with the quality of belkin cables and this one is no exception
it works exactly as one would expect and is nice and flexible with positive connectors .
the belkin cables are well made
i have found them consistently solid in all that i have purchased from them .
bought a new computer where the usb plugins were at the bottom and my logitech camera for skyping no longer would reach my monitor , so this fit perfectly and allowed me to place the camera where it once was .
i bought a couple of these to extend a few things farther away from my computer to crate more space
it works as it was indented to do
i never had any problems with it , just plug and play and your all set
whats more great about this product is that its cheap
i bought <NUM> of these extension cables for a total of $5 .
i have had this for a while
i use it so that i can use my phone or tablet in bed while charging
eventually , it stopped charging them as well
it is inconsistent
good price , but i would like a more reliable cable .
this item is exactly what it claims to be : a very long usb extension
male to female , gray , stylishly modern
who cares ? it is a cable , not a car
there isn not that much to screw up .
always in need for a usb extension for some reason
this cable works as described .
i used a 3ft usb extension cable that came with my device : it worked perfectlyi used this 10ft usb extension cable from belkin : the computer said there was a problem with my usb device every time i tried to connect itmoral of the story : this cable from belkin does not function properly
don not buy it .
i have needed usb extentions but they are hard to find and too expensive when i do find them
they cost as much as a dvd player , lol
this is a good product at a fair price get <NUM> you can use them in a <NUM> places .
can now operate my trackball from a longer distance
well worth the money
i bought two as you cannot find this length in to many stores .
belkin has proven itself as a leading cable manufacturer
this extension cable is no different
please disregard negative reviews by others who say it can not connect between device and pc
this is to extend what you already have so it doesn not clutter things more
a good example is if you have an iphone with the 3ft charging usb cable , and your pc is on the floor , you can connect this extension cable on a rear usb port , and extend it to the desktop , poking out a little , yet not adding to clutter
then you can connect your iphone usb charging cable to the female end of this extension , as if it was your pc directly
works well , and i highly recommend this cable to extend your usb needs .
it is a cable , what more do you need to know ? it is heavy enough and works , good bran i have used before and will use again if the need arises .
if you go to radio shack , or best buy , or staples , you will find the same cable for $30 or more ! the cable is the same as those more expensive one , and even has easy opening package ! love the cables , and the price .
it doesn not say anywhere in the listing that i could find that this isn not usb 2
my mistake for just assuming it was , i guess
still , i think they should make it obvious that it isn not 2 , since that is pretty much the standard today .
works great ! exactly what i needed for my room
running a connection through the to my computer and through usb to my ps3
( just not at the same time
i used this to extend the usb port off the back of a tv so we wouldn not have to get up anytime it was used .
this cable is advertised as having "480 mbps transmission speed" which is false
on the packaging it says only <NUM> mbps , meaning this is not a usb 2
0 cable
be careful ! i would have left one star but thankfully amazon let me return the cable without any hassle .
this works perfect to plug our external hard drive into out hdtv so the hard drive isn not hanging from the back of the tv
we watch <NUM> hd movies through it every weekend ! and the price is excellent too ! way cheaper than the cable i found in the electronic stores ! highly recommend !
i like to set my printers on separate tables and not take up my desk space on hardware that is better left working across the room
great product great price .
okay , it is a usb cable but it is <NUM> foot long
works fine and allowed me to move the printer further away from my computer desk .
what else can i say ? it works and its worth the money
i trust belkin , they make great products
very nice
this allows me to comfortably use my computer while on my <NUM> inch bravia from the comfort of my couch
it has been stepped on , run over , chewed and generally mistreated and still works great
i bought them two years ago .
i needed to add a few feet to my webcam to place it on my flat panel
as always belkin did the job with no visible loss of quality .
the product is great and handy if your are trying to extend the cable of your usb devices
good built quality and easy to use
fast shipping as usual from amazon
works great , nice to have the printer away from the pc on the desk
gives me more room on my desk .
great price and works very well
great price and works very well great price and works very wellgreat price and works very well
works as advertised
and its belkin
so you know you are in good tangles ! ok i made that up
good tangles
but seriously
great cables .
this is a great cable i needed something long and had a price concern , when i received in the mail i realized this is a decent quality cable ! thanks
it is exactly what i wanted , the delivery was perfectly on time and it was very easy to install it
i will definitely recommend this product
thank you
great design the cable seems like it will last a long time
the cable i received is a shiny blue color
i recommend it .
i just recieved this cable , and it works great
like one of the other reviewers , i needed it to extend the usb hub for playing rock band on my xbox360
this cable works great , and now there is no risk of people yanking the cord out of the console while 'rocking out'
i haven not tried it with any pc accessories , but as far as i can tell it maintains a solid connection without any issues
for a price of less than $6 and a brand name like belkin , you really can not go wrong with this cable if you are looking for a usb extension
highly recommended !
i use this for my hauppauge hd pvr
the usb cord on that is only 6ft long and my pc is far away
i got this and it worked just like it should
who says you need a name brand ? also , the picture is a gray usb extender
i got a black usb extender
which i actually like more
keep that in mind .
many don not know that their usb devices can actually reside some distance away from their computers , because they have become used to the limitations placed upon them by the cords that come with their peripherals
but this cable makes it possible to achieve a balance between functionality and aesthetics
with this belkin component , you can now think of setting up an entire room as an information hub , rather than just huddling your computer station into a cramped corner
for those who have multiple platforms in one area , this extension cord will make it possible to more easily share usb devices without having to buy an additional usb switcher
just plug and unplug your devices at will with the additional length
if there is anything negative to say about the product , it is that you don not have much choice as to manufacturer
in a real sense , that doesn not matter : you are going to be happy with what belkin has on offer
but it would be at least psychologically comforting to have more of a choice .
good product for a good price
would recommend to anyone who needs an usd extension cable
sure beats the price of the local electronics stores .
just what i needed at the time , i 'm not sure it is going to handle <NUM> couputers , i will know soon , thanks for your help
i bought two of these , one for a usb power extension for my turtle beach headset , and another for a data cable
both of these work well
i pulled them out of the box , and thought "oh man , these look stiff" but no , they are nice a and supple wile still feeling heavy duty .
i used to be a professional photographer , tv news videographer and news producer , so i was weaned on high quality broadcast quality tv pictures from expensive pro equipment
they are sharp , with excellent color and low noise
consumer camcorders , even digital ones , left me cold
they just didn not cut it compared to the pro gear i had used
that is , until i saw the sony trv900
this baby is really a sleeper
the picture quality from this <NUM> chip camera is professional quality
the picture is very sharp , digital artifacts are not noticeable , and the picture is amazingly noise free , even in marginal light
( in low light , it is noisy , like all ccd cameras
) manual controls on almost everything let you tweak the picture as you learn more
it doesn not look &quot ; pro&quot ; so it might not impress your friends , until they see the results
and the sound quality is not quite up to the picture quality , at least with the built in mics
but if you want to really do some fine quality videography which could be shown anywhere , even on network tv , this is your best choice .
when i received my new camera i was using a borrowed pc100
i did not return the later right away 'cause i wanted to do a little test to prove if the 3ccd system was truly that different
my wife asked me what i was doing , to which i answered : &quot ; let is see if i just overspent our money
&quot ; i used the same tape to film our newborn baby with both the pc100 and the at the same position
what were the results ? my wife said : &quot ; make sure you do the rest of the filming with the new one
&quot ; the pc100 had darker areas , you could see the interlaced video shadows , and a whole other bunch of things i don not know the terms to 'cause i discovered them when i saw the same picture filmed with the
it is a lot heavier than the pc bunch from sony , so go for it only if you are looking for results instead of convenience .
i find myself using the as a digital camera almost as a matter of course
i purchased the sony 64mb memory card ( you need to also buy the pcmcia attachment that it fits in ) and taking pictures is a veritable joy
the supplied floppy drive is next to useless - in fact , i don not know how you'd use it in an active environment
there are manual options : aperture setting ( depth of field ) and shutter speed ( great for darker environments ) among them
you can also record stills right on the tape and later extract them on your computer
transfering video and stills to a pc is effortless ; i use the ieee <NUM> ( firewire ) interface
to make great movies , including voice over ( if needed ) and background music , i am happy with ulead video studio rather than the microsoft xp windows movie maker program - which appears to be a minimal implementation of ulead is program
adobe premier 5
0 might still be better , but i am not professional enough to shell out [that kind of money] or so for that program
by the way , ulead also allows you to create ntsc vcd files , which , once downloaded to a regular ( i use easy cd creator platinum ) , can be played on your dvd player ( not all of them , but certainly those produced in the last <NUM> years )
anyway , a great camcorder and camera ; i find myself walking around with it for hours on end - it just feels good !
i decided to get this camcorder for the better picture ( 3ccd ) and slew of excellent features versus some cheaper models
i have not had reason to regret my choice ! i do action photography and have actually been able to capture some stills off it that are quite impressive
nowhere near as colorful and crisp as my canon slr can give me , but quite useable
and without the cost and time of having to take a slew of photos , develop them , print them and scan them in
don not be fooled by cameras that might offer more than 640x480 resolution
larger pictures don not do you much good if they aren not as good quality ! these are almost as good as some digital cameras give you
in fact , i will be selling my digital camera off , as i don not really need it in addition to this camcorder and my regular camera
the camera is a little larger and heavier than some other digital camcorders , and it does not come with a memory stick included
instead it includes a floppy disk adapter for capturing stills off your tapes
neat to have , but not real useful in the field
be sure you get the pc card adapater as well as a memory stick , this camera does not take them directly
i love the lcd screen , it will flip completely over and lay flat against the side facing out
really nice for watching playbacks
it gives quite good sound and is nice and bright
the battery life is actually not bad at all , compared to a digital camera ! but still worth getting an extended battery
be careful about getting the highest life ones , they are quite big and heavy
controls are pretty well placed and easy to use
i like having things like a neutral density filter turned on with a simple button push
overall , the useability of this camera is very out and implemented
if you want a quality camcorder that will last you a long time , this is one of the best for the price you can get .
experience shows that when sony introduces a first new product in its class , they make a killer product to strenghten their image
this camcorder is one of them ( the others are their first sacd , first dvd player , first walkman , first digital walkman , first trinitron tv , etc
) this camcorder provides broadcast quality-- sharpness , color saturation are first rate
i also tried other <NUM> ccd camcorders and none of them come close to the performance and construction quality of trv900
the only drawback i can think of is the trv900 has a bit of bluish tone in the color which can not be adjusted and the brightness is one stop too bright ( which can be adjusted )
you want it - you got it
excellent picture quality ; sony that really works ; capture to tape ( or extra adapter card+memory stick a must ! ) ; bright lcd display ; variable audio feedback ; ieee firewire , controls that are easy to reach and are for those familiar with previous sony cams
specifically , we use this unit for compositing of people , environments , and virtual products
the firewire coupled with adobe premier is a
simply said , that is essentially all you need ( plus consistent overall lighting in a environment )
g3 or pc - firewire will suck it down as fast as anything i have seen
positively get the custom aluminum case if you do a lot of travel and want to keep your camera happy
this will keep all your components safe and somewhat easily accessible
get a 2+ hour battery ; the battery has plenty of gas - surprisingly the lcd does not drain the juice too quickly
a pc transfer card for the memory stick would be nice - but you can get away with plugging the ieee and transferring from memory card or to tape
the construction and attention to product detail is marvelous
little rubber covers , positive audio clicks , all the nifty want you to have sony make your next car
sure there are a few quirks - but there is few products that have such high quality and high value as the trv900 !
i stand by most of my old review , but after using the epic a bit more , i have found that the spot metering is a good workaround for some of the camera is programming
put that spot meter to careful use , and you can get more and less flash use
also , after days of heavy rain recently here in california , the weather resistant features are nice , too
this camera really is a great value ! old review : i'd suggest finding an old olympus xa in good condition instead of this mostly , although it does have a sharp lens
and it is very small and light too
but the autofocus is a little touchy , and it wants to shoot at f2
8 in any kind of even slightly low light
with the xa , you can choose any aperture ( or iso ! ) you want , and the lens is even sharper
of course , you might have to use a tripod too , but the stylus epic won not really acknowledge that choice ! however , within its' parameters , it is a slick little camera , and you really shouldn not have to pay too much for it ; refurbished ones go for under $50 .
this is the second stylus i have purchased in <NUM> years
i have three teenage daughters that love taking pictures
my second daughter just turned 16
i bought my oldest daughter a stylus when she turned 16
they like the camera because of its small compact size and ease of use
it fits nicely in their purse
after comparing every camera i could find for under $100 , the stylus had much better quality
in order to find as good a camera , i had to double the price
the viewfinder alone , is larger than most , very clear and crisp
never had a single problem with the first stylus
the fact that the price has come down is a real plus also
i paid more for the stylus two years ago , than the one bought recently
i give this little camera a <NUM> star
you will not be disappointed
it is a really nice little camera
it is easy to use , attractive and it is not cluttered up with whistles &amp ; bells you will never use
just point and shoot .
several reviews enhance on how good camera is this so i will go to the point with some examples
i have taken photos with the object very close to the camera ( 15 inch ) with the spot metering mode with candle light , tripod , without flash , asa 400 , with impressive results
i have taken photos with the object very close to the camera ( 14 inch ) with to spot mering mode with flash , without over exposure and impressive results
so , i would support that the short ( 14 inch ) focus capability is great and useful
if you want close photos of objects with a idiot proof little camera , i mean without zoom , tele , macro as it should be this is the choice
i had met several focus problems with objects at 2m from the camera , hope that practice would help me to improove
however some photos have excellent focus and sharpness
excellent dark sunset photos with the night scene mode with asa <NUM> and tripod
red eye reduction pre strobes are unconfortable , but very effective
i prefer this than cheap zoom cameras
definitevely i support the several comments of experts telling this is incredible considering the price .
this camera is one which has consistently received lavish praise from photo magazines such as popular photography for its ease of use and its superb zuiko lens , which is comparable in quality to 35mm single lens reflex ( slr ) fixed focal length wide angle lenses
i have borrowed one belonging to relatives and am quite impressed with how it easy it is to use , as well as the fine pictures that it produces
admittedly , it is a bit small , so those who are comfortable using larger point and shoot cameras or slrs will have to try to hold it steady
otherwise , you will get blurry pictures
my favorite point and shoot camera is the yashica t4 super with its 35mm carl zeiss tessar f3
5 t* lens , but the 38mm zuiko lens on the stylus epic is just as contrasty and sharp
furthermore , the stylus epic is at least $50 cheaper than the yashica t4 super
those who want high quality pictures from an inexpensive point and shoot camera should strongly consider buying this petite gem .
recently i looked at over two dozen models doing some research for a friend who wanted to buy a new compact camera to replace his old nikon
although we are really looking for a point and shoot with a short zoom capability ( about ) and so didn not pick this one since it is fixed focal length , i was impressed enough with it to want to make a few comments
first of all , none of the other two dozen models had a lens this fast , at f2
there were a couple that came close , but you will find , especially with the point and shoot zoom models , that the fastest the lens will go is only f3
4 or 3
many of them are f4
0 or more at the low end
so if you want at least f2
8 speed , this camera is about the only way to get it
there is one exception to this
you can buy a rollei qz35w for ten times the price and get an f2
8 lens also
for the extra money you also get a camera that weighs in at <NUM> oz
however , it has an amazing 1/8000th of a second top shutter speed , which ought to be fast enough to freeze an airplane propeller , not just a golf swing
well , the rollei is a great point and shoot but it doesn not fit in your shirt pocket very easily at <NUM> oz
, not to mention it will cost you a pile of green stuff
two other things the olympus has that the other models don not or usually don not have is there is no shutter lag
you hit the shutter button and there is no perceptible delay
the yashica t4 , although it has great optics , has this , and so do many of the other point and shoots out there
the problem can be prounounced enough to affect action shots
for example , you might take a picture of your child running across the living room floor only to find out that he wasn not even in the frame when the film was developed
the final thing that is nice about this camera is the "weatherproof" aspect
this doesn not mean waterproof , however , but a few drops of water won not hurt it
all in all a great little camera to take with you anymore .
i have recently rediscovered film photography and have aquired this famous point and shoot
film is still a great affordable option for high quality pictures if you scan your negatives
plus without an lcd to worry about how the last picture looked , i can focus on taking the next picture
right out of the box , the size impressed me , it is one of the most compact 35mm cameras i have ever seen in person
only a canon elph is smaller , but that is basically a rectangle
the stylus epic is one of the best handling cameras i have ever touched
modern digitals are mostly rectangles , but the stylus has a great tapered design that feels great in your hand
the shape is also perfect for sliding in your pocket
the sliding cover is also the on/off switch , so there is no odd buttons or switches to slow you down
on top of that , loading film couldn not be easier
my main concern is that the camera is rather loud when it advances film , so its not exactly a subtle camera , but otherwise i am glad i picked this up
update : having just developed a few rolls , i am very impressed by the optics of this camera
just a "generic" <NUM> speed film yielded pleasing results , but i noticed some quirks
first of all , due to the rather wide lens , you want to get up close and fill the frame
but the lens cannot focus closer than about arms reach
not much of a problem for most situations , but closeups aren not really suited to this camera
and then there is the flash
yikes ! if you can avoid it ( and you can with fast film and a steady hand ) , do not use the flash .
a good p&amp ; s
very nice design
does tend to overexpose by1/ stop
lens is actually a little wider then 35mm ( ~32mm )
lens sharpness is good for a p&amp ; s but does not compare to good slr optics like nikon
cameras operation has some idiosyncrasies like how you get to spot metering mode , the fact that the focus is driven solely by the indicators in the center , etc
the date stamping is a little too small and too close to the center of the image
is a problem
the viewfinder is very tiny and has severe distortion
overall , a good , but not great , little camera
if you can spend more get the yashica t4 w/zeiss lens .
popular photography recently called this camera "
possibly the best camera in the universe and i agree
it is small , light , it has an *excellent* quality lens
the lens quality is way above the average point and shoot
the lack of zoom is one of the reasons the lens can be *so* good
maximum lens opening of f2
8 and maximum shutter speed of 1/1000 sec ( but no 'manual' setting ) it has an 'intellegent' flash that reduces flash intensity for shots ( prevents overexposure ! ) many different available 'modes' give you great versatlity , including ared eye' flash mode and a ispot' metering option
i own <NUM> of these cameras !
the epic qd cg is the epic model that i bought , with the quartz date imprinting ( which i have never used ) and the attractive metallic &quot ; champagne gold&quot ; finish that aren not in the base model , but without the &quot ; panoramic&quot ; in the more expensive dlx model
the f/2
8 lens is sharp and bright , and the camera is small enough to carry in my pants pocket
but the feature i like best is the accurate exposure system
the default automatic mode uses fill flash effectively
you can also force the flash off or on , or combine foreground flash with long exposure for night scenes
the flash is bright enough to reach 27' with iso <NUM> film , and its brightness is automatically reduced to prevent overexposure of subjects as close as 1
the flash is close to the lens , so you should use the mode when the ambient lighting is dim and your subject is pupils are dilated
using this mode , i have never shot a subject with red eyes
if you don not absolutely need a zoom lens , this is a handy camera that takes great pictures .
i have been shooting pictures since i was about 8 , almost <NUM> years
i have owned several cameras , my first real one being a canon that i bought in high school
i upgraded to the eos line in the early '90s and still shoot that line in film , but added medium format ( hasselblad ) for portrait and wedding work ( part time )
earlier this year , i got a digital and decided that i would invest a lot of time into that medium
but i wanted a film camera that , like my digital , had a good lens , was small and lightweight , and shot quality prints
i researched for several weeks all potential reviews on p&s ; cameras
my wife has an older pentax that was alright , but i had decided that the zoom lenses are often slow and not sharp enough
i debated between getting a yashica p&s ; off ebay , getting the newer zoom camera by the same maker , or getting this olympus
i decided on the olympus and am glad i did , though i am sure the yashicas are fine cameras
working the camera is a snap
open the lens cover , and shoot
i think the default setting is for fill flash , but the settings button cycles around -- so just use it for several rolls of film and get used to it
it does , however , reset to the default setting after you turn it off by closing the door on the lens , which is a minor problem
there is no need to wait for the lens to pop back in , since it is fixed focal length ( though -- keep in mind the difference )
you may not believe me when i say this , but this camera will take better pictures in low light situations than all cameras except slrs with the most expensive lenses
having to use the rest of a roll of film and not particularly caring about picture quality , i took this camera to a recent high school football game
now football in texas is big , and stadium lighting is pretty good , but it is never good for anything other than expensive , fast lenses , and fast film , right ? wrong
well , partially wrong
this camera , armed with <NUM> ( yes , that is <NUM> -- something i almost never shoot ) film shot nighttime moderately lighted pictures that came out great ! the angle is wide , so the content leaves something to be desired , but this wide open apeture lens will definitely do the job when you need a fast , quality lens
there is a red eye reduction feature in the flash cycle , but i haven not tried it
my applications for this have been mainly outdoor , and the pics i have gotten are very sharp and as good as my slr is
the guy i sold my to won a national award with a pic he made with that camera
i recently asked him if he could do the same with this olympus
he simply asked me when i wanted to bring it over !
i have bought four of these little cameras
( for different family members ) it is reliable
it takes great pictures
it has the necessary features but not so many that one is overwhelmed
it fits easily in a shirt pocket
it doesn not have a zoom but that is just one less thing to break or use up your batteries
if you want to fill the frame just get closer to your subject
it doesn not have all the whistles and bells of larger more expensive cameras but a camera you have takes better pictures than one you left behind because it was too big or so expensive that you didn not want to risk losing it
i have the usual assortment of larger fully featured cameras as well as the required digital camera but i wouldn not be without one of these little beasts .
this camera is simply awesome
take it from me , i am no stranger to digital photography
i was using my sharp digital camcorder to take digital still pictures but i was not very impressed with the results
moreover , a camcorder is too bulky to haul around
so i decided to go with a smaller camera
i did a lot of research before settling on the camera from olympus
it is feature rich , looks very cute , and delivers pictures with a punch
it works effortlessly on my windows xp
my favorite feature is the 3x optical zoom ( digital zooms are generally useless )
the lcd screen is crisp and clear , although it is use should be limited to preserve battery life ( use the lcd only to review already taken shots
do not use it for taking pictures - use the viewfinder )
the video output works great
i could go on and on
it is comnpatible with smartmedia which , in my humble opinion , is the better storage medium
overall , i am quite impressed with the zoom
it is simply a wonderful camera
i wouldn not expect less from olympus
regarding complaints about lack of a usb port for downloading : just get a smartmedia card reader
a good card reader costs less than twenty dollars and simplifies your life a lot
i personally use pny smartmedia card reader but any good card reader should do
not only does a card reader download your pictures at blazingly fast speeds , you also save your batteries by not using your camera to download the pictures
ps : if you are looking to save money , consider getting a refurbished camera
they come with a manufacturer is warranty and in most cases are essentially brand new cameras
i should know
i got mine refurbished : - )
bang for buck , this is the best and most versatile all around digital camera to get
i recommend that you buy <NUM> nimh batteries and a charger
the supplied alkaline batteries are just to get you started
i also recommend a <NUM> or <NUM> mb memory card if you intend to use this camera while disk adapter
it does come with a serial cable for pc and mac as well as a video cable for viewing on your tv
for turning your digital photos into real prints , i have had good luck with ez prints ( [
] you use their free software to send them your photos and your prints arrive in the mail
this overcomes the last drawback of digital cameras
there may be other similar services that do this so shop around for the best picture you just took , just the iscreen' button
this way you won not have to close the camera to switch modes .
i joined the digital parade after an agonizing <NUM> months of comparison and indecision
i liked the sony mavica features , especially the floppy disk method of storing images
i have used my work is mavica <NUM> and loved its simplicity and great ability to take indoor pictures without a flash
i also loved the rechargeable ismart' battery which sony sells with its product ; it actually tells you how much time you have remaining before a battery change is required
it could also do short mpeg motion pictures - with sound
the big negative : it is huge and weighed a ton
it is resolution wasn not sufficient either
i finally ended up with the olympus 450z because of its high resolution , its available floppy adapter , its many features for the price , and its compact size -- its virtually identical to my old 35mm model
it takes great pictures , but isn not as capable in low light conditions as the mavica 91
the panaroma picture capability was a feature which i never thought of using -- until i saw the software demo which was included with the camera
it is like magic -- it puts together a panarama of pictures into a single composite image
truly amazing
in summary , the <NUM> is a great camera , albeit only slightly better than the <NUM> - and doesn not include the floppy adapter as the <NUM> did
great - yes , but the price really hasn not dropped as i had hoped
finally , if you are thinking ahead , you will order <NUM> or <NUM> nimh batteries and a recharger , a <NUM> or <NUM> meg smart card , and the floppy adapter
you have suddenly got yourself a $700-$800 camera outfit
shop around - there are cheaper places to buy your camera .
as so many others have noted , this is a great camera for the money
it is loaded with features seen only on more expensive digital cameras ( changeable iso values , great low light capability , a true optical zoom lens with the ability to add 2x digital zoom on top
i could go on and on about the *pros*
there are so many ! here are the *cons* i have picked up so far : 1
camera does eats its four aa alkaline batteries quickly , especially if you use the lcd a lot
the fix : i purchased rechargeable <NUM> mv nimh nexcells and a maha c204f charger for under $40 online and neatly solved this problem
not the most intuitive menu and button system
the fix : reading the manual before trying to use does help
a *quick guide* sheet comes with the camera
keep it handy to figure out those features you don not use often
now i know how to use the features that are important to me and don not have to refer to the manual any longer
manual is confusing with three languages/page
the fix : english is primarily on the pages so look there first
the content index page so it is easier to find what you are looking for later , and keep the &quot ; quick guide&quot ; that comes with the camera handy
if you are going to take panoramic photos , only the *olympus* smartmedia cards will support this feature ! if you purchase brands like sandisk , you won not be able to take panoramas
the fix : purchase olympus smartmedia cards on auction sites or at bidding sites online
i bought my olympus <NUM> mb card for $45 under the olympus website price
slow photo download rate
first of all , i didn not find the serial port download overly slow , especially compared to other digital cameras
however , since camera has to be on during the download , i recommend purchasing an ac adapter ( doesn not have to be olympus brand ) to save on batteries
but if you are a speed freak , then the fix : purchase either the usb or flashpath floppy disk adapter
either will speed up download time considerably
bottom line for me
best camera for the money , hands down ! buy one for yourself and see !
a couple things : pros : 1
i have dropped my olympus d450 several times , and once i slammed it in a car door ( in its case )
for some strange reason , it still works fine
you can get an mp3 player that uses the same type of memory card ( smartmedia ) , buy a <NUM> meg ( smartmedia ) chip , and reformat the card for either device when the occasion calls
a <NUM> meg card can hold either a couple hundred pictures , or about an hour of music
the floppy adapter works well to transfer files to/from the smartmedia card , and a usb smartmedia card reader works even better
however , downloading data using camera and serial cable is quiet an frustrating process ( batteriy draning , time intensive , etc
) cons- 1 : start stockpiling aa batteries now , especially if you really like using the lcd screen instead of the viewfinder
2 : this isn not the kind of camera you can whip out real fast and and take an instantaneous photo
it takes about four seconds from when you slide the cover open to when you can snap a picture
all in all , a good buy
maybe this camera is too dated
it is quite large , it can barely be called a compact camera
also , the maximum aperture is a mere f4
5 , so it is a good idea to use film
on the other hand , the picture quality is excellent , with quality
genuinely much better than the results i can get from a digital camera , especially at the shorter end of the zoom
and the flash does a pretty good job
there is some , but in general it doesn not scenes , the way most flashes do on small cameras
i had this camera for a number of years , and my friend still uses it
over the years it is developed a few problems : it makes a grinding sound as the zoom extends ( it hasn not broken yet , but i expect it will someday ) , and it can be a little tricky to open the door enough to activate the camera
maybe the stylus epic 2
8 lens is a better choice - there is no zoom but it has a faster lens , a smaller body , and slightly better picture quality .
i am a rookie
i never really had a use for a camera with a zoom lens
i was always content to use my very simple point and shoot
one day , my pictures came out so badly from my simple camera that i decided that i need to get one with a zoom lens
i looked at many brands of cameras , but i never considered the olympus
then one of my friends , who knows a lot more than i do about cameras , convinced me to test the olympus stylus epic
i fell instantly in love , and i bought it
that choice has been the best decision i ever made ! i love the small size and sleek design of this camera
i also love all the bells and whistles on it , especially the timer because no one gets left out of the picture
it also takes very good photographs
i recommend this camera for anyone , including people like myself
a great piece of equipment , and the price was very reasonable .
i went back to the 35mm format
the olympus stylus epic zoom80 qd cg camera is what i wound up buying
this is a competent camera , much like its predecessor but with additional picture taking modes and a zoom lens
the additional picture modes include combinations of flash and timed exposures allowing you to create some neat effects under low light ( night ) conditions
the <NUM> to 80mm zoom lens is effective in framing shots without a lot of ugly negative space
the camera is weather resistant , which seems to be some extra wiper seals on the lens and a thick gasket on the camera back
this should enhance its longevity , but don not expect to take it swimming
i will let you know about durability in another <NUM> years
this isn not a replacement for an slr ( and isn not intended as one )
the quality of pictures is somewhat less than you would experience with an slr
but if you are attracted to cameras and specifically to olympus for their small size and ergonometric elegance be sure to check this one out
a manual settings snob i was
my <NUM> minolta had a light leak
too late to get a repair before a trip to alaska i bought a point and shoot
i bought this brand because olympus have glass lenses
but the design is what really sold me : the camera is &quot ; splashproof&quot ; , the lens cover ingenious , and the small , very lightweight oval fits in your hand like it belongs there
it has trekked with me across alaska , florida , fell in a fountain in savannah , been on a beach too many times to mention and has bounced off airport restroom floors more than once
it survived being thrown <NUM> feet into the street when my bag was grabbed and the camera flew out of it
it has gone fishing with me and even scooted off the face of a glacier once
and you know what ? besides being more durable than i could ever imagine , it takes great pictures
two years and <NUM> rolls of film later i have had <NUM> bad pictures
all because i was taking low light shots without a tripod -- my hand jiggled the camera
last month , we were on the beach at midnight with a full moon out
i placed the olympus on stairs and set the timer so me tripping the shutter wouldn not jiggle things
beautiful shot of the ocean , the moon and unbeknownst to us until the photos came back
a sea turtle coming ashore behind us
i have taken the olympus places i would of never taken the expensive ( ok ! ok : and clunky and heavy ) minolta
the olympus fits in my pocket
it is not an ordeal to get it out and determine the lighting , put on the right lens or even to load the film
i miss the minolta when i have a beautiful sunset to shoot and know what it would look like with a polarizing filter and asa <NUM> film
and , when i was set up with it i could actually focus faster than the autofocus on the olympus
but three bad shots out of 3000 ? i can stand a nanoseconds delay .
the size and design of this camera make it ideal for what it is designed for
it takes great pictures in light and dark ( though it is better at outdoor pictures ) and it fits easily into your pocket
it opens quickly with one hand ; no fumbling around with a lens cap
it focuses quickly so you can take a shot from a closed position very quickly
the only thing worth noting is that this is a point and click camera
if you want to control exposure , shutter speed , etc
or play with macro , this is not your camera .
takes great pictures
survives a drop onto the sidewalk ( dropped from <NUM> feat from a bench )
handles rain no problemo
still takes great pictures
small size is great and it is easy to use
the editor review says battery compartment is hard to open -- it is unintuitive by the arrow direction ( it looks straight ) , but look at the hindges and you will figure it out
the viewfinder is tiny , but it works just fine
the camera is small size lets you get extra pictures from a <NUM> exposure roll becuase you don not have to roll out the film at all to cross the camera body : ) it is so small that it fits in teh secondary compartment of the camera bag i bought along with it
the zoomer is cool
they say that it is 2
2x , but a 35mm with no zoom is
45x , so you are actually getting 4x zoom relative to a 35mm wide angle point and shoot
this is the best bet for your money
if you want more zoom , go get a professional camera , but with that much money ( over $200 ) , its time to go digital
this is the perfect camera for me going to la and shooting at the la galaxy ( soccer mls ) players .
performance from such a small piece of equipment
since having a kid our travel baggage tripled and i couldn not afford to carry my canon elan ( great one when i bought in 1993 ) along with my camcoder
i looked around for a small 35mm point &amp ; shoot and i decided on delux edition of this one over minolta freedom zoom <NUM> &amp ; <NUM> because of the price and reviews i read at this site
the delux edition has a more gold look to it and comes with a leather cover , battery , and has a panaromic mode function
size is a big plus to this one even though the minolta is looked more appealing to me
the pictures came great as mentioned in lot of other reviews
the best are the ones i took in the night with 'night scene' flash mode
one has to be very careful not to shake the camera when taking pictures in this mode .
i have looked at dozens of point and shoot cameras for myself as well as friends who wanted to buy , and although i don not own an olympus stylus epic , there is one thing that is great about the model that i wanted to mention , because out of the two dozen or so models i compared , the olympus was the only one that had an f2
8 lens
i am not sure if the epic zoom <NUM> goes that low , but the fixed model does
so if you want a compact point and shoot camera with a relatively fast lens , this is about the only way to do it , unless you want to spend about a $1000 for a rollei qz35w ( which , at <NUM> oz
, is a tank compared to the olympus
of course , the rollei has that amazing 1/8000th of second shutter speed , probably enough to freeze an airplane propeller , not just a golf swing )
but getting back to the olympus , there were a number of models that were f3
4 or f3
8 , but the olympus was the only one at f2
8 .
for the buck , olympus gives you a better lens than any other consumer level camera
i love the shots i have taken with this camera
great colour , focus , and sharpness .
i have had only good results with the stylus
it takes wonderful pics , is very handy to tote around , and takes quite a beating
( my 1st stylus was a 35mm model and it resided on an open shelf in a boat for <NUM> years without misfiring once )
my only disappointment has been the reduction , though contact lenses make a real challenge for any direct flash unit i have seen .
even with <NUM> iso film ( the manual recommends iso 400 ) , this camera takes very sharp indoor/outdoor pictures with brilliant colors
haven not tried the <NUM> film yet , so i am eager to try some outdoor evening pictures
however , with the <NUM> film , this camera still took some excellent night pictures ( using a tripod ) of downtown during christmas season
don not regret buying it one bit , best investment in a long time .
if you are like me , you saw this discontinued sangean and thought , &<HASHTAG> ; cool , it is just like sangean is tiny dt110 , plus weather band and a speaker ! want want want ! &<HASHTAG> ; then i patiently waited until i found one in new condition
here is the problem with this radio : standby time is about <NUM> days , without using it at all , and it is completely dead
just sitting there running the clock will kill batteries
i had a similar sony ( without speaker ) which i left in a closet for more than a year and the battery was still working
i notice that a couple people report short battery life with the newer dt110 as well
maybe these things are ok if you use it every day and don not mind changing batteries constantly , but don not use too much effort obtaining one .
this is a very nice radio to have around all the time , at home and when traveling
it is very small ( about the size of a deck of bridge cards ) and i take it backpacking and all all of my trips
i am on my second one , first one stolen
weather brodcasts are a real nice touch , you don not have to wait for a tv or radio announcement of the weather , when you can get the report and forecast direct from the nws
tv , fm and am all work great
good memory setting features of about <NUM> for each band
the alarm is another nice feature when traveling
also nice is the internal speaker , which is rare on a radio this small with this many bands and features
the fidelity is all that you would expect from a 1&quot ; speaker , but it is fine for what is is for like listening to news or a talk radio show
the audio is stereo on the headphones on am and is of very high quality on the headphones for all bands ( tv , wx , am and fm ( stereo ) )
my only negative comment is minor , relating to battery life
i have used alkaline and rechargables and i seem to only get about <NUM> - <NUM> hours , which is sufficient , but adds up over time
i recommend the use of rechargable nimh batteries with this unit to keep the operating costs down if you use it frequently as i do .
purchased radio for someone in the hospital who likes late night am radio and hates television
normal am radios did not have any reception in the icu but this one did manage to tune two of her favorite stations
battery life could be better as it ate a new set of batteries each day
tuning in the stations was initially difficult because when i tuned it at my home with the feature , it picked up over <NUM> stations some nearly <NUM> miles away
i just wanted it to receive her three favorite stations so i had to continuously delete stations until i got her three loaded
it is tiny and will easily fit in a shirt pocket with room to spare
it is truly high tech and about 1/4 the size of a standard small radio
it is not cheap or cheaply made
if you like small electronic gadgets and can afford it , i would recommend you purchase one .
i have had this radio for <NUM> years now and still going strong
the weather band has always been poor in my area ( which is why only <NUM> stars ) , but other than that no complaints
oh , and obviously the tv function is no longer usefull , but i didn not get it for that
this is a small radio that does a good job pulling in stations .
i have had the ( or its predecessor ) for years and have been happy with its excellent fm reception and useful interface ( lock switch , auto power off , easily accessible volume control )
it has survived many drops
the has the same ergonomic features , is smaller ( but not much lighter ) , and adds a clock and weather radio reception
the shutoff timer is <NUM> minutes instead of an hour , which i like , and the presets are much more convenient than the 200v
my only quibble : no belt clip
i like that it uses aaa instead of aa batteries , since i always have spares for my palm pilot and noise cancelling headphones
i haven not tested the earbuds that came with it--i will probably throw them away .
i love radios and have owned over thirty
i am constantly looking for the holy grail - a radio with great reception and plenty of features
i haven not found that yet but i can do comparisons
here are the pros and cons of this one : pros : 1 ) this is truly a pocket radio and very light
it feels lighter than a deck of cards
2 ) digital tuning - a rarity in pocket radios
you can quickly scan from station to station and from am to fm to tv
3 ) has a speaker built in
you don not need headphones
the sound quality is adequate for talk radio and am music
the volume is adequate for quiet environments
4 ) it has tv audio and the reception was ok on the four major stations in my area
cons : 1 ) there is no built in fm telescoping antenna
you need to insert headphones or the included wire and switch it to speaker in order to get most fm stations
a small telescoping antenna would have been an improvement
i find the hanging wire annoying and i think it is just a matter of time before i lose the wire
2 ) the reception is not as great as the amazon review suggests
i found that there was a good deal of static on several am stations and am is very dirctional
fm was great on headphones , though
3 ) the cary case is a joke
it looks like an afterthought
it is a membrane thin piece of vinyl that will not protect the radio
4 ) the ear buds are also a joke
5 ) weather reception was the worst i have ever heard on a modern radio
6 ) the tuning light is bright and , no doubt , draining the batteries like crazy
if you are looking for a pocket radio that is digital and has a built in speaker , this will do
i see lots of room for improvement , though
i also think it is overpriced
i think it should be 39
it would be about right at that price .
i have had a lot of problems with other radios to obtain adequate reception in my home area
this radio was far superior and brought in all the stations clearly
i wish that the user interface was easier to use but the performance makes up for it
no regrets .
i bought one of these radios about <NUM> or <NUM> years ago primarily to use while traveling and at the ball park
it proved to be a good radio for traveling and an adequate radio for use at the ball park
in the ball park reception was bad in certain areas and in other areas the radio had to be turned to tune in the station
since i live in an area by the sea , the battery terminals get corroded faster than normal and apparently something inside got corroded as well since operation now unreliable
the compact size is great
the timer is rather annoying since the factory setting can not be changed and to make it through a ball game , the radio must be turned back on a couple of times
i found the supplied ear buds to be uncomfortable but used them anyway --- the jack is smaller than normal
bottom line : the radio worked good enough that i am now ordering another one from amazon at a savings of more than $20 when compared to what i paid for the orginal one .
just thought i'd stop/shop by and look at what was available from sangean
i might as well say it , i have had my current sangean radio ( ) for <NUM> years - that is <NUM> years of extensive use hours a day x days+ a week
while all other radios i have owned within this size range have long since '' ( over <NUM> years ago ) , this puppy just keeps on working with the same reliability as day 1 ! am/fm/tv reception is quite remarkable as it always has
weather band has always been a little weak in some areas of colorado - you can pick up several different stations if you are in the right area , which is pretty cool actually
i would not give up this radio for anything else out there
just one question still haunts me - will this thing ever die ? i hope not , but if it does , i will get another sangean .
this receiver is so small it is easy to carry with you always
i have it with me while commuting and bicycling
the reception is great in city or country
it was my best little friend on 9/11/2001 and for weeks after , when we had no idea what was going to happen next ! i have owned one for a few years and through my rough and careless handling i broke it dead
am buying a replacement today , however
the only drawback is that i have to keep the instructions around to remind me how to set the memory functions , but everyday use is easy .
the dt200v for about $10-$20 less performs better , lacking only the dt300vw is weather band
the 300vw is a little smaller and lighter
both are small enough for a shirt pocket , perhaps with a bit of sag
the weather band doesn not work very well , getting the same station on every channel on my dt300vw
the dt200v can be operated in the dark ; this is impossible with the complex operation of the dt300vw
the performance difference is most noticeable on the am band , where the dt200v does remarkably well in distance reception
the dt300vw uses aaa batteries instead of aa , and has a ( unusual ) subminiature jack on the earphone jacks , requiring an adapter ( included ) to use any other earphones .
why does all these great reviews miss the key key feature that is missing---direct push button tuning
this should be radio design 101
a thousand versions of mp3 and ipod type players
numerous small radios that you must listen thru earpieces and not thru speakers
why is it that not a single manufacturer can build a small pocket radio that has a digital tuner and direct tuning push button presets as in your automobile
radio shack built a couple of version some <NUM> to <NUM> years ago and they were excellent
i have had <NUM> or <NUM> of them but all have now broken and rs no longer offers ( they do offer a rather miserable version that has presets but you must scan thru all presets to get to the station you wish )
could you imagine doing that on your television set with some <NUM> hundred channels ? this seems such an obvious product instead of the 1001st version of another mp3 player
there are those who carry a radio in their pockets when walking ( think postmen ) , going to the beach , working , hiking , camping etc
this is a natural and yet no one builds such a unit that i can find
again radio shack had such a unit some years ago ( a couple of models--i would suggest a couple of ergonomic improvements but on the whole they were excellent and some bean counter at rs decided to no longer offer them )
sony has such a unit , but you can only listen via an earphone ( not thru a speaker )
someone once told me that the key to business success was always to know what the chikens are eating .
this is a great little radio
very light weight for walking and it has the tv channels in addition to the standard am/fm reception
i have trouble falling asleep at night and i put on the headphones , tune in to a talk radio station and drift off to sleep
the sleep timer turns it off in an hour
use rechargable batteries on this and save a bunch .
i wanted a cord reel to hang from the ceiling in my garage out of the way , yet immediately accessible without having to get an extension cord , unwrapping it it , etc
this one , though much more expensive than the variety you will find at the local hardware store , is built like it will last my lifetime and my kid is too
heavy gauge metal everywhere with no corners cut
it comes packed like it was china too with heavy styrofoam all around
i found a reelcraft ceiling mount on another web site and it , too , is made to last
i would not hesitate to buy anything from this company as they obviously build their stuff for the commercial , market
i have used it for quite awhile now and have nothing but good things to say about it .
although you may a bit more for this item , it will last the rest of your life -- assuming reasonable service/use
i used just about all the others , and found the others to be sales ( toss in garbage when breaks
) frequently , when new , the *others* give some clue how they will ultimately fail as well as how they will perform
stiff cable , increasing and inconsistent spring tension ( in lieu of constant tension , thin bases , poor dfm , etc seems to plague the others
however , the reelcraft works like a charm
after seeing the reelcraft in the professional arena being used in the harshest of environments and <NUM> years later working like the day it came from the factory - i decided to bitet the bullet and spring for what will be my last power cord reel purchase .
i had a cheap offshore reel that died very quickly
i have had the reelcraft for some time now and you get what you pay for
this is a strong , reliable unit
mine is mounted on the ceiling of my garage
for me that is a perfect location
but it can also be easily mounted to a wall or other location
having worked as an electrician i can vouch for the fact that reelcraft used quality ( hubbell ) parts throughout
this unit has a very strong spring that winds up <NUM> feet of 12/3 cord effortlessly
the <HASHTAG> wiring throughout really does make a difference
plug a good leaf blower into this unit vs a <HASHTAG> gauge extension cord most of us have , and you will feel the difference
a tip : be sure that the unit is connected directly into an electrical outlet
if , in order to locate the reelcraft in `your' best location , you must use an extension cord , be sure it is made of <HASHTAG> wiring
no reason to have a reelcraft that can do a great job if it has to suck power through a tiny extension cord straw
update december <NUM> - unit still functioning perfectly
can recommend
update march <NUM> - unit still hangs from my garage ceiling and works just fine
still recommend
update january <NUM> - unit in use for a few years now
not constant use that a mechanics service bay would see , but home use
unit holding up like new .
reelcraft electric cord reel with 12/ cordthis cord reel is designed and manufactured to be used in commercial settings such as automobile repair facilities , where it is used dozens of times every day , year in and year out
shops can not be bothered with the frustration or breakdown , of inferior cord reels
- every aspect of this reel is high quality ; heavy steel , strong spring , finish , large support bracket , design , and workmanship , etc
as long as it is not abused , this product should last for decades
by comparison , the cheap imports are mostly plastic to keep the price low -- some even have plastic internal parts that wear out or fail too easily
- simple to pull out the cord length needed , and stop on any "click"
when done , it rewinds with ease and authority every time
you don not need to baby it for the last 10' to get it all on the reel - it just goes on
the large rubber can be easily moved so more , or less , cord hangs from the roller bracket
- the 45' 12/3 cord is rubber sheathed , so it stays soft and flexible even in cold weather
unlike less expensive reels that might use the smaller <NUM> gauge or even <NUM> gauge wire , the 12/3 cord is more than adequate for any <NUM> volt tool , or even multiple tools
hubbell brand plug and receptacle are used
- the 4' 12/3 pigtail should be long enough for most installations
the fitting that protects where the pigtail goes into the unit , also keeps the cord close to the reel and out of the way
if the combined draw via this cord will be greater than <NUM> amps , the pigtail needs to be plugged into a receptacle that is on a <NUM> amp circuit
- this is the smallest commercial of this length
the reel itself is only 12" in diameter and the unit projects a mere 13" from the wall
- the roller bracket can be in any of <NUM> locations around the reel , for mounting on a wall , ceiling , bench , or wherever you want ; so don not worry if the amazon photo has it in the wrong place for your installation
for example , refer to customer images for a different mounting location than amazon is photo shows
- packing was excellent , with large molded foam blocks completely protecting the reel from damage
unsurprisingly , there was no shipping damage
there are other cord reels on the market , such as the coxreel , but i don not see how theirs could be any better
i also own a grizzly h5695 12/3 cord reel , which costs 1/5 as much as this one , and is a terrific value
however , comparing the reelcraft to that grizzly is like comparing a milwaukee drill to a ryobi drill
commercial quality versus homeowner quality
this is a lot to pay for a cord reel , but commercial grade reels are expensive
highly recommended .
i use this more than any other item in the shop and have never regretted purchasing it a few years ago
it truly is bomb proof
so buy once and be done with it
on a side note , amazon cs was excellent in shipping a replacement unit overnight after ups "lost" the first one .
excellent product i have used for months
the cord easily retracts
easy to hook up
great for the center of the garage
i have been using this on an almost daily basis for a few months now
pros : plenty of length for your average size garagecan mount on the ceilingcons : retracting mechanism can be finicky , but has much stronger recoil then others ive usedi would definitely recommend this to anyone , just be prepared to fight with the recoil until you get the hang of it .
i received this as a gift , because i added it to my wishlist
about the same time , i purchased an almost equivalent version from home depot , but with larger wire
this is 16/3 and the one i have is 14/3 or 12/3
this one works well and my other one doesn not
the hd version is wire gauge is large enough that it won not retract fully , unless you wind it perfectly
i have to "coax" it in for the last <NUM> feet on a good day and pull it back out an rewind it atleast once when is starts sticking with 7+ feet out
this version retracts fully , with no fuss
i am really happy with the performance .
it was great out of the box
within about <NUM> months the center plug somehow got bent inside so i can not plug anything into that one anymore
after <NUM> months the lock stopped working so when it is extended i have to put something on the cord to keep it from reeling back in
i should also add at this point the cord may have been pulled out a couple dozen times at most
update - i opened it up today to see if i could get the lock to work again
turns out there are <NUM> plastic cogs that work together and one is mounted on a rivet
it had gotten a little bit bent so straightening it out seems to have fixed the problem
i also cranked the spring up another revolution so it retracts a little more forcefully and all the way to the end
easy repair with a screwdriver and pair of pliers .
simple review for a simple product -- it is just a good cord reel
triple head is nice , circuit breaker is nice
mounting is easy , and hardware is included for both ceiling and wall mounting
smooth feeding out and reeling in of cord .
i like the product , however after doing some research i found what i believe to be the exact same reel at sears for $24
i actually purchased one from sears when they were offering it for $18 and some change
the construction is identical but the one from sears does not have a circuit breaker , to me that is not a big deal
other then that so far it works like i expected it to .
pretty sweet piece of kit
suspends from the ceiling well , the rectracting assembly works well
some people may complain that it is only <NUM> gauge , but it works well for quick jobs in a workshop .
having owned the sangean , the sangean as well as the sony , i can readily say that i like all three pocket radios very much
all three are pll ( phase locked loop ) digitally synthesized receivers
this is how they rank in my opinion : 1 ) best am : almost a tie between the and the
2 ) best fm : almost a tie between the and the ) radio controls : the and the both have a stereo/monaural switch ( bandwidth control ) for detecting weaker fm stations whereas the has a dx/local rf ( radio frequency ) gain switch for fm , tv and weatherband signals
personally i think that the stereo/mono switch is far superior to the dx/local switch for receiving the weaker fm signals ( when set to mono and not to stereo )
the dx/local switch on the other hand is much better for reception in large cities ( when set to local and not dx ) so that the rf gain of the unit is lowered when trying to receive very strong local signals on nearly the same frequency that strongly interfere with each other
thus depending on where you live , work or play will ultimately determine which specific radio with which type of switch control you may want to purchase
all three have lock/hold switches for keeping the settings fixed except for the analog volume control switch
in addition , the lock switch on the must be set to "on" when changing the batteries ( you have up to <NUM> minutes which should be more than adequate ) so that the presets won not be lost
the sangean radios both have fine sounding deep bass boost switches whereas the sony does not ( it appears however that on the sony a small amount of deep bass boost is always on and cannot be turned off )
also , the sony is always in stereo mode for fm reception and sounds fine as well
all three radios sound the best with better earphones or earbuds than are supplied with the units which is not too surprising , but i found the sony headphones adequate for most purposes
also , all three receivers can achieve quite strong volume output levels before significant distortion occurs
4 ) all three radios are very well constructed with the sony probably the most rugged design
the as well as the sony have a hinged battery door ( the sony is door can be forced to come off however ) and also seems well built , but a few people have talked about the breaking if it was dropped
the does not have a hinged battery compartment at all , but it also seems to be well built
the comes with a small , tightly fitting slip case with a belt clip attached to the case ( in addition the specially designed case was constructed so that the radio can be completely operated very efficiently without ever taking it out of the case at all , except of course for changing the batteries )
the sony and the both have a removable belt clip that attaches to the radios and neither of them come with a case
both the and the fit very nicely however in the zippered micro hard shell case , , by sakar ( available online or also available at many stores nationwide )
this hard shell case is not very expensive , but also provides a great deal of protection against breakage if the units were dropped
5 ) presets : : <NUM> total- <NUM> on fm , <NUM> on am and <NUM> random ( priority settings )
except for its <NUM> priority settings that require a single key press , it is a little harder ( 2 key presses , one with a time delay , instead of one on the sony ) to directly and quickly choose a loaded preset
however an automatic scan/seek capability , aps ( automatic scanning for and loading presets and seeking sufficiently strong stations ) can be used to either load presets for the first time or even scanning for previously chosen presets
: <NUM> total on any band in any order ( called my favorites ) , but they are found only in a forward progression without the ability to go in reverse
an aps procedure can also be used to setup presets on any band quickly and automatically
: <NUM> total- <NUM> on fm1 and <NUM> on fm2 , <NUM> on am , <NUM> on tv and <NUM> on weatherband
it is extremely simple to setup presets and to retrieve them , but tuning is not an automatic procedure and requires single adjustments or the tunning button can of course be held down to speed up the scanning process
6 ) power : : <NUM> aaa : up to <NUM> hrs on fm and <NUM> hrs on am
: <NUM> aa : up to <NUM> - <NUM> : <NUM> aaa : <NUM> on tv or weatherband , up to <NUM> on fm and <NUM> on am
7 ) the ( now under $35 at amazon plus shipping , but is now as much as $50 elsewhere ) and the ( now under just $50 on amazon including shipping ) are much higher priced than the sony ( now under $29 plus shipping on amazon ) and have only <NUM> day warranties whereas the sony has a limited one year warranty
8 ) best overall : i live in a rural area in the high mountains of new mexico so for my location the stereo/mono switch is superior for improving the weaker fm signals ( see my note on this above )
thus , for my location and for working around computers and in heavy rf ( radio frequency ) noise environments ( such as fluorescent lighting , electric motors , etc
) either indoors or outdoors , i really like the the best for the great stability of the fm signals and its ability to detect weaker fm signals ( it does not have a clock , but it does have a <NUM> minute automatic shutoff timer )
i like the sony the best outdoors and it is also mostly ok indoors ( which comes with a clock , but no automatic shutoff )
for all around use if you require a small speaker as well as earphone listening , probably the is the best ( with both a clock and an automatic shutoff ) , but all sangean pocket radios mute during automatic scanning and seeking which makes it much harder to find weaker stations on am or fm very easily except using a manual and thus a more tedious search procedure
for more details , please also see my separate reviews of the and the .
um , i wish i hadn not bought this radio
it is larger than expected
it is too big for the pocket
well , it would fit but then the lock would have to be used so the buttons didn not get pushed and then the stations cannot be changed
if you want a clip you have to put the radio into this cheesy plastic thing that has a clip
it looks super cheap and not what was expected for a sangean
that clip was a hassle to use so it was gone in a minute
i bought this radio hoping for one that was more convenient to wear at the desk and walking around and on walks without thinking about the radio
cons : it takes two button pushes to change the station to your next preset
what ? ! i thought it would be smaller than it is so read the dimensions closely
no built in clip
i have two other sangean radios that i love
oh well .
great : reception , bass boostgood : sound quality , priority station key , button layout , case/belt clipneeds improvement : could be smalleri think $40 for a radio is a reasonable price
i was really looking for an audiophile radio for a higher price but could not find one
i had an aiwa for a decade but lost it
very small , great sound
the sangean arrived on time with earphones , case with belt clip and manual
you can station memory for am and fm seperately
it is easy to set and even swap stations in memory
you can assign three stations to the priority button and access them quickly
i am buying a radio , not earphones
to test i used klipsch image x10 earphones
the radio sounds great for the price range
the bass boost is intelligently designed similar to the super linear bass on the aiwa
it is not designed for dirt cheap earphones which is a good thing
i easily pick up powerful fm stations from <NUM> miles away
the am reception is such that i do not have to turn the radio to tune local am stations
there is no hiss on local stations and near hiss free on stations at a medium range
the buttons are designed ergonomically so that you can distinguish them by touch
the hold switch stops everything but the analog volume wheel
the position of the wheel prevents unwanted changes
the hold switch also serves to preserve memory on battery changes
digital volume control is annoying when the steps in volume change are too large
the analog wheel is an intelligent choice
i use rayovac ic3 <NUM> minute rechargeable batteries available on amazon
they actually do recharge in <NUM> minutes with the rayovac charger
i have not had to recharge them after using the radio daily for a week
the batteries are about two years old
this radio is a little larger than i am accustomed to
i haven not cracked it open
it may be the am antenna
the aiwa was smaller but did not have near the reception this radio offers
the belt clip is a good compromise
for the price i am very pleased with the radio and recommend it
i will continue looking for a smaller radio with high fidelity sound .
i have a radio shack branded version of this unit
same design
works fine
good sound , memory works as supposed to
reception seems solid
i purchased this to replace a toshiba am fm stereo micro radio that was credit card sized and fit my shirt pocket while i walked or jogged for many years
the mini stereo jack finally broke and put it out of commission
since none of the other japanese firms produce such products anymore , i started hunting around in amazon and other web retailers
i chose this unit based on price and on other reviews by other buyers
although it is no where near as small as the toshiba was ( which was exactly the same size as a <NUM> credit cards in a stack ) this unit performs the same while adding digital and memory tuning
it is very sensitive in both the fm and am bands and provides very good sound using any decent stereo headphone
i use <NUM> pairs of sony headphones fit in my ears so that they do not fall or move about while i jog at white plains , ny hs track
the ear bud headphones supplied by sangean sound great but would fall out while i ran .
i got this and a refurb
sony walkman to serve as wireless stereo headsets for my home theater
this is a very nice radio
i have seen it offered for as much as seventy dollars in other places on the web .
i am so very glad this radio was available for me to order ! i have several sangean radios , and every one of them--let is see , i believe it is <NUM> different models before this one , <NUM> of one model and <NUM> of another , plus one each of 3--every one is aces ! i am sure there are some sangeans that would not be a good fit for me , but so far i haven not bought one that wasn not
i read the specifications and the reviews very closely , and a lot of times ! before deciding to order one
this radio , like the <NUM> different models i got before it , came well packed
the instructions are great
the features are excellent
it is well made , sounds just like i need for it to sound , has the functions i need , is a great size and shape--it is just great
i only got this today , got it working in just a few minutes , and i am looking forward to having it for a long time
i walk , don not run , and will be very careful not to drop it
i have it in the case it comes in , and that fits fine in my pocket
a home run , sangean !
this durable , amazing , practical , radio has been with me for several months now , tagging along with me in my shirt pocket , coat pocket , jacket pocket , pants pocket , strapped to my belt , tied to my sleeve , dangling into a bag , clutched in my hand or just laying near me
i have worn out a dozen pairs of headphones along the way ( in case you think i am or anything ) , but the radio is totally unscathed
it is the greatest
it fits in my pocket , has amazing sound quality , and is every bit as good as it was on the day i bought it
it is amazing how such a magnificent piece of electronic engineering can be rendered so by poor interface design
i like the small size and excellent sound quality , but a few aspects of the ergonomics could be improved
for example , i like to switch rapidly between stations ( as soon as a noisy commercial comes on , for example )
this requires pressing two buttons instead of one -- as all of my previous walkmen could do easily -- so i am a bit annoyed at that
the is to use the "priority" settings , but it is limited to only 3
yet i could live with that if only it functioned properly
i bought one and had to exchange it because the indicator didn not work
they sent me a new one and it had the same problem
guess it must be a design flaw
so i simply have to accept the fact that it will suddenly stop working without any warning whenever the batteries run out
but i thought "no way , that can not be true" so i contacted sangean
they told me that the battery indicator light is only there to let you know that you have just removed the batteries ( duh ! ) and should replace them soon before the station settings disappear ! hey , tell me something i don not know , like the fact that the existing batteries are weak ! when i told the sangean guy that every single battery indicator in every single product i have ever owned was there to tell me that it is time to replace the batteries ( and not a "reminder" that i just did so a second ago ) , he shrugged as if i were nuts
second , i figured out that they must have made the left earpiece chord shorter so that you could easily tell them apart while running without having to read the fine print ; however , they don not do anything to let you increase the slack on the chords ( by sliding the wires apart ) , so the left side keeps popping out of my ear whenever i turn my head ! the , of course , is to go out and buy a pair of headphones and use that instead
when i asked him if sangean intended to address any of these problems in the next model , he said "no , but we will be making it in lots of choices of colors ! " ah , so good to see that they have their priorities sorted out
guess i will keep this because i am not finding anything better out there , and frankly , it does sound great
and yet i still give it <NUM> stars , so you can imagine how happy i am with its qualities
( sigh )
i have bought many small radios over the years , including others by sangean
i was very disappointed with this one
it looks cheap , feels cheap , and has mediocre sound
for the price , i was expecting better
i know i could have bought a much nicer radio for less money .
this is a nice little radio - compact , gets very good reception for me , has good bass response and is quite light
it fits easily in a shirt pocket
of course the ear buds that came with it are trash
but that is the same with every audio device you buy - shouldn not be a real shocker to anyone in this day and age of mp3 players , ipod is , personal devices etc
, that you are paying for the device , not the ear buds
just realize that going in and buy yourself a decent set of earphones or earbuds at the same time you buy the unit
my major complaint is how the favorite station settings work
setting up your favorites is easy enough , but to listen to them , you have to click a "recall" button , then rapidly tune up or down to get to whichever station you want and click "recall" again before it resets to normal tuning mode
if you want to go to another favorite station , you again have to click "recall" but this time , instead of starting on the station you were last on , it goes to the bottom of the list , so you ( again ) have to scroll all the way through your favorites
i like it much better on their other radios - like the sangean , where you just click a favorites button and you can then scroll at will and when you turn the power off and on again , the station is what you left it with last
this constant business of hitting the recall button , then repeatedly scrolling through your list , hitting the recall button again , is quite annoying
what otherwise would be a <NUM> star rating gets <NUM> stars knocked off as a result .
the crucial advantage of this unit is the ability to receive fm stereo signals in mono mode , which boosts the ratio
in simple terms , this makes weak stations sound stronger
( sony walkmans no longer offer a mono switch )
otherwise , this digital radio tuner has functioned very well for me during my many long walks over the past couple of years
a minor downside of this unit is the fact that it is a little bulky , requiring <NUM> aaa batteries
also , the "" were worthless ( and painful ) , but easily replaced by $9 panasonic headphones
the station preset selection controls are complicated and , and the instruction manual is hard to understand
but this is a good tuner , and i do recommend it .
i have bought two of these radios and worn them out
now i have bought a third dt100 , and i see this model has been discontinued
my first dt <NUM> was bought from ccrane
i used this radio until i accidentally killed the radio by dropping it
my second dt110 lasted for years , and was damaged when i shipped my belongings cross country to washington
so i bought the sony walkman
the sony had , and similar size
the sony also has weather , and tv audio
the sound quality of the sony was always a disappointment
the band button is a real problem
the sony eats aaa batteries
the sony has no <NUM> minute off switch to save batteries
the sony has no lock switch that prevents the assorted buttons from doing their thing
the ^}*=##{ band button is on the front of the radio
i primarily listen via a pillow speaker , and some times i accidentally hit the stupid band button and my station is gone until i turn the lights back on and find out which band i have wandered into
the sangean <NUM> had awesome sound quality
almost as good as cd on strong stations
i would recommend that you toss the ear buds that comes with the radio ang get marshmallow or skull candy headphones , and the sound quality will surpass your ecpectations
in closing bye bye sony ! i am going back to sangean !
the shortwave radio is great
very light weight and the main reason is for times in hurricanes when electrical companies shuts down the power
i also purchased some eneloop aa rechargeable batteries to use with this shortwave radio
very good for listening to other stations globally
highly recommended for everyone at home , individuals camping and all others involved in some form of technology with radios .
i would have given this <NUM> stars but that didn not appear to be an option on the amazon
com form
after seeking through the entire sw band three different times , at different times of the day and night , all i got was bbc , and that only once , and some religious broadcasts
i would have been very happy to get stations from just canada and mexico , but no such luck
it is a very nice am/fm radio with some spiffy features like a sleep timer , but my hope was to receive international broadcasts , and i am returning it because it simply did not do that .
this is a basic am/fm clock radio if that is what you need , it looks nice sounds nice , and works however if you need single sideband you need to look at the ats 909 .
if your like me and you can not stand the deluge of commercials on top40/classic rock radio and live on local college radio stations ; this radio is for you
all my favorite college radio stations come in crystal clear , everything from 89
1 wfdu to 91
1 wfmu and one of the long island radio ( 92
7 wlir ) stations my big digital receiver cant even find
the buttons are a little small , but that drawback out weighs the features
like a button located on the top of the radio that illuminates the lcd screen for <NUM> second
the short wave is somwhat alright , i am told that the big city with all its electronics interfears with sw reception .
this is a good little radio : good reception , good tone , good controls
its only weak point is its size , though , too big for a beach robe pocket , too small to stand up on its own on a beach towel
but otherwise , i am as happy as a clam in the with it .
this radio is the best of its type for the money
the sangean <NUM> gives you ssb and a nice knob , but it is considerably more expensive , and also quite a big larger
if all you want is a good , small , am/fm , basic shortwave radio with a speaker and memory , you can not beat this
i find its reception to be quite good , on all <NUM> bands
as far as battery use , it works very smoothly with rechargables
it has a battery indicator that displays when you first turn it on
when only <NUM> segment is lit , it means you are getting toward the end ( maybe about <NUM> hour left )
at that point , you can charge a second set of batteries and install them when it finally dies
you can also just disregard the battery indicator and wait for it to die , and then charge the second set
as soon as the battery power gets too low , the radio shuts off , but still retains the time and memory station settings
it can run in this mode for hours
in my case , i had <NUM> nicads in it that died , and it took me <NUM> hours to charge <NUM> nimhs that i use as the 2nd set
the radio is time and memory settings were still intact when i finally installed the nimhs ( you have <NUM> minutes to make the actual switch )
very nice !
the sangean am/fm digital shortwave world band receiver is a great little radio
i have had mine for a bit over one month and really do like it
however , it is somewhat larger and heavier than i thought it would be
i bought it to take along on overseas trips , but i am afraid it is going to be too bulky for comfortably stuffing into my bag
oh well , the unit is going to be a lot of fun at other times
so far , i have not been troubled by the short battery life ( 20 hrs
) described in previous reviews
i suppose that could be a problem under certain circumstances , but aa batteries are easy to replace anywhere in the world that has paved streets
i am a bit shy about describing my experience with the sangean because several of the earlier reviews were apparently made by radio experts or aficionados much more knowledgeable than me
i am just an ordinary guy that likes to listen to the radio once in awhile , but i do have some observations from my experience with it that might be helpful
first , the radio is touted to be an entry level shortwave unit
i thought that shortwave stuff might be fun to play with , but i quickly found out that listening to most programs from europe and elsewhere is silly because i am usually asleep when they are broadcast
nighttime is apparently best for shortwave reception
i find it best for sleeping
further , the interesting shortwave broadcasts are hard to find among all of the bands and frequencies available
yes , i admit it--i am in over my head with shortwave
i even bought a book about shortwave radios that included programming schedules
i am still confused
i suppose a true shortwave fan might find this radio more usable in this area than i have so far
the radio has a great "preset" feature that i like and use all of the time
radio stations are easy to program in and to scan
i enjoy the sleep feature , the dual time display and option to lock the radio for travel so it doesn not turn itself on in the airport like my last radio did
the am and fm stations come very well and the digital tuning seems to be right on target every time
the comes with an ac adapter which is nice , but it doesn not charge batteries in the radio
there is a backlight for the display window , but it is sort of feeble and is almost useless except in complete darkness--like maybe a cave or a closet with the door closed
a set of low end ear buds is included along with a envelope that serves as a case
i haven not used either one yet
i think maybe this review sounds more negative than positive , but i didn not mean it to come out that way
the is a dandy radio , i use it every day and i do recommend it .
hi folks its vince the radioman
i have a large selection of radios and love to do compares and share my thoughts
this radio is good for the casual listener who doesn not want to spend a lot of money but would like to hear some sw along with am/fm
the fm section is the best part of this radio
the am section is filled with images and noise for the dxers out there
for local am its pretty good
the built in sound and sound slection modes are surpisingly good
the overall construction and quality is fair at best and the radio is a battery hog
the sw section is fair
if you want to hear the big broadcasters , ok , anything else is static
there is no fine tuning
the yb300 and the eton e <NUM> are far better for tuner sensativity and battery life
its not a bad radio but others are better
how about <NUM> and half stars .
i had this radio ( from radio shack ) for some 5+ years and it always was one nice , easy to use , reliable , with nice reception , nice alarm "human" system device ! i gave it to my dad and he still using it daily
the only thing is the price
it is hard to swallow an idea of $100+ for a radio
but the device itself it superb .
owned one of these for about <NUM> years and dropped it several weeks ago
replaced it with another one last week
works great on all bands , ssb and synchronus detection would be a nice addition though .
i have been listening to shortwave ( or world band , as it is called now ) for about <NUM> years , and am awash in radios
after some friends decided that there was room for just one more , i received the sangean 606ap as a gift , and have been thanking them ever since
like everything else , the sangean has it is good and bad points
it is compact size is just right for the pocket on the motorcycle jacket
the audio quality , although , is very easy to listen to for extended periods of time , and greatly improves with a pair of stereo headphones
the f
band displays excellent stereo characteristics , and the sensitivity means capturing stations 75+ miles away is a common occurence
the mediumwave ( a
) band is a little above average , with great daytime reception , and nighttime listening being almost too good - dozens of stations all coming in at once
detuning the frequency by +1/-1 khz can usually help
i was blown away by the shortwave performance on a radio this size , and using the power adapter over the batteries , the performance increases greatly
the major stations sound like they are broadcasting from up the street , and sometimes i have to lower the antenna or toggle the local/dx switch to avoid overloading
smaller stations can be called up quite well , and tuning up or down by <NUM> khz can help to remove some interference from nearby signals
a wide/narrow setting would be a great addition , as would ssb for grabbing some utility frequencies , but the plusses like low power consumption with a <NUM> step battery indicator , lighted display , dozens of presets , 2 clocks , travel lock , +5/+1 tuning , and a nice travel case , make this a great radio for globetrotting , or having the world on your nightstand
i highly recommend this radio to anyone wanting to fish into the fray of world band radio and come up with an excellent catch .
i have owned this particular model of sangean , as well as several others , for a number of years
sangean radios , in my experience , have excellent sound ( for their size ) , have great reception , and are quite easy to use
i listen to classical music , international news , and domestic news while at my home in radio/tv/cellphone land
only the sangeans work up here
our pretty little grundig porsche radio has to live at the city house to be useful
back to the <NUM> - the metal and plastic case of the <NUM> is quite solid , handsome , and compact
the stand is both very convenient and angles the radio perfectly for easy viewing of the lcd at counter/table/desk height
the sound quality is terrific , considering it is a single driver of maybe 2
5&quot ;
sound is full , dynamic , lively , remarkably rich , and very fast
bass is lacking , as you would expect over a radio with such a small driver
the <NUM> has one nasty habit , which is that if you plug it in , and it has batteries in it , it will drain the batteries instead of using the wall power
you must take the batteries out of it before it will use the ac
mine is a fairly early one ( it uses the european power adapter with a us adapter on it ) , so this may have been fixed
as mantioned , this is my 6th or so sangean , and the whole line is well built ( except perhaps the 322 ) and they all sound great
i highly recommend them all .
for several years , this has been my favorite multiband pocket radio
it recently has been bumped from that position by the kaito ka1102 ( see my review on the kaito )
both receivers offer excellent am fm and shortwave performance , including stereo to earphones
the choice between the two radios hinges on features , price and desire for ease of use
sangean offers long wave reception , kaito does not
kaito has single sideband mode ( for hams ) , sangean does not
humane alarm of sangean is less "jarring"
sangean in much easier to use/manual is easy to understand
kaito is cheaper but feels more solidly built
sangean has rotary volume control , kaito has up/down buttons
"batteries included" on kaito ( nimh rechargeable )
both are pretty amazing for their size !
after trying a few different radios , including the grundig yacht boy 400pe , this one is still the best
fm reception is by any other radio i have , plus very good am and sw sensitivity
many more features than the yb400
very decent sound from the speaker and superb sound from a good pair of headphones
the yacht boy might sound a little better ( the speaker is at least twice the size ) , but i still love playing with this little gem
there are characteristics about all radios that each individual would like to have in their ideal radio and you can read a few of those in the other reviews
however , i personally can not think of anything i wish were different about this radio , other than i wouldn not take it to the beach and expose it to the salt air
otherwise , it goes everywhere
it is also the radio i use most often in the house
and for the price you can get it for , it is more than worth it
i guess instead of just repeating a lot of what has already been written , i will just say i have bought three !
i am a radio nut
i even have one in the shower
i needed a radio to replace my sony
i live in the california central valley between fresno and bakersfield , the radio reception here is horrible and i like to go to sleep with the radio on and ear plugs in
with my sony i could get fair am/fm and sw
with the sangean i get great am/fm and sw
i get stations on the sangean that were nothing but static on the sony
it is a little bigger than my sony but has some great features the sony didn not
like setting the length of time before it turns off and the auto station select ( i used it for fm , i like all kinds of music )
the handy display light that turns off after <NUM> seconds
and to pull in those weak stations , a simple button to change to the fine tune mode
also handy is the lock button that locks the front pannel ( it keeps me from changing the station by bumping the buttons while falling asleep ) if you don not mind a big radio and want one for am get a cc radio
if you want a small radio to travel with or a small radio for your night stand , this is the best for the price
pros : great reception , easy to use , small , comes with a nice leather case , ear plugs , external antenna and ac adapter
cons : no wrist strap .
after much research for a small radio that can receive shortwave for an extended overseas trip , i settled on the sangean 606
i already have a sony sw7600gr ( standard in the industry imo ) but wanted something smaller and less valuable ( the sangean is about 1/2 the size as the sony )
initial thoughts were that 1 ) it was chunkier than i was expecting and 2 ) the plastic casing seemed cheap
i have now lived with it for ~2 months and i am thrilled
reception for fm and am is on par with the larger and more expensive sony and it is marginally easier to use
i also prefer the sound of the sangean over the sony ( npr talk radio mostly )
with automatic station setting , fine tuning , alarm , light , etc
, it is an ideal travel radio
other nice features at this price point is the protective case , sw reel antenna , and ac adapter ( not included with the sony ! )
i have used it daily for ~2 months on the same set of batteries
if i were doing a lot of shortwave listening the sony would still be preferred , and the quality feel of the sony is 2nd to none
biggest complaints ? the flimsy up/down tuning buttons and that amazon suggests buying an additional antenna that already comes with the radio
full disclosure- this is my 4th sangean but that just speaks to how good they are in receiving tricky am & fm radio stations
update : i paid ~$115 for this sangean and when i bought my sony sw7600gr it was ~$200
if you can get the sony for ~$25 more than this sangean , i'd probably go for it
just make sure it is the same made in japan radio it used to be !
update for december <NUM> ( my earlier review was sometime in <NUM> when i purchased the unit ) after two years of use , i am revising with the following comments and upgrading to <NUM> stars ( if i can figure out how to do that easily ) since i don not think you can rate something 4
5 stars yet
durability : i have carted it across <NUM> continents over the last few years
it is been shaken about quite a bit
absolutely no problems
the ac adapter size/weight issue is not important
this unit is a battery miser
i never carry the ac adapter
when you travel light , you don not want to carry any adapter and batteries last a long time and are cheap to replace
shouldn not be an issue even if you are ecologically fanatical due to long use you get out of them
i still don not like the dim light , but overall the unit is been a workhorse , i must say
===detailed analysis will follow if i have the time , but overall impression of quality , ergonomics , and design is very good
for those who primarily want a good travel radio , with the shortwave as a bonus , i have a few minor complaints
1 ) light for frequency is not that bright ( and display is a little small for us older folks who want to see the clock at night without groping for our glasses ) 2 ) bigger problem is that the light goes off to save battery power
what is wrong with that ? nothing if you are running on batteries , but when using the ac adaptor i would like the option of leaving the light on ( like a clock radio ) so you can wake up and see the time without groping in the dark for the display light switch
3 ) the power supply is dual voltage ( good ) and almost as heavy as the radio ( bad )
it does sag in a us outlet , but that is aesthetically annoying more than it is an actual problem
fm reception is excellent , i must say
haven not played much with the sw yet
written instructions are good and seriously , my overall impressions are very good
clearly , much thought has gone into the "radio" aspects of this device
it is a little weak as a "clock radio , " which is a bit of a shame , but it does have very nice alarm ( dual ) and a gentle wakeup alarm that does seem very "humane
"it might have been more accurate to award this radio 4
5 stars
more later .
i got this radio november 9th , and am not pleased
the reception isn not that great , and the f
has too much override ; where you hear the same station on adjacent frequencies
unless it is a very strong station , you have to tune away from the nearby station to get anything
sangean could have done better .
i have tried a number of compact or pocket shortwave radios
the sangean <NUM> is by far the best
it has all the standard sangean features - a digital clock , automatic radio after 60 , 45 , 30 , or <NUM> minutes , radio and beeper alarms , fine tuning , band scanning , automatic tuning , a tuning light , a faintly lit display window , and a shortwave frequency range of 1
711 mhz to 29
this last feature is what i most like about the 606
compact or pocket shortwave radios often compromise on the frequency range ; but not the 606
the reception of the am , fm , and shortwave bands - considering the small size of this radio ( 5 3/4" x <NUM> 3/8" ) - is very good
its physical body seems to be solid , although the tuning buttons are a bit delicate
the speaker tone is somewhat tinny , of course , but not unusually so for a radio of this size
there are no tone adjustment controls , nor does it have ssb capability
a power adapter and reel antenna are included
overall , the <NUM> is very easy to master , since its design is intuitive ; it is also attractive and extremely portable in its small flexible pouch
the price is rather high , but a good radio costs money
i recommend the sangean ats <NUM> as a simple compact radio for travelling and hiking .
i have been a radio buff and collector for many years and i have a large collection of radios
dollar for dollar pound for pound this is one of the best buys out there
it is compact and great for travel or listening in bed
it has and excellent tuner on all bands
it has a suprisingly excellent sound from the built in speaker
it has full sw coverage with a 1kh tuning increment which is essential for serious dxers
it is functionally laid out well
really couldn not ask for more in a light weight compact
it far out performs the sony sw35 and <NUM> and the grundig yb300 and <NUM> which is in the same price range
also , radio shack carried this radio under their name ( rs ) and has recently held clearance sales where this little gem was selling at a great discount
if you see it buy it , its a must do !
i had this radio for <NUM> months before it stopped working
it is made very cheaply and does not justify its price
the battery cover in the back kept falling from the day one ( nothing was broken ) , just sign of poor quality control and fit and finish
it ended up in trash somewhere
will not buy sangean brand .
reception is super for it is size
i bought this radio primarily for listening to fm and talk radio
i don not listen to shortwave
my favorite fm stations come clear and .
it is hard to believe that you can purchase so much performance for less than $40
this little radio has the ability to fill a large room with undistorted sound from any of its <NUM> bands
moreover , it is quite easy to use
sensitivity and voice clarity are remarkable
the automatic gain control deals nicely with weak and strong signals
selectivity is quite good , but one could use a larger tuning knob ( or i suppose in my case , smaller fingers ) to make those fine adjustments easier
the size of the radio makes it easy to pack
although you get a lot of radio for a few dollars , it would have been nice if sangean had included an ac adaptor
i have used this radio a lot since i purchased it , and it does have a hardy appetite for batteries when played at high volume
accordingly , i purchased an ac adaptor for it
i tried several adaptors before i settled on the radio shack 4
5 volt &quot ; international&quot ; model ( cat
this device accepts almost any input voltage and frequency and produces a full amp of filtered , regulated dc
unlike other adaptors i tried , this one is relatively &quot ; quiet
&quot ; it does not induce hum or electrical noise
best of all , it folds up in a very small travel package
if you don not want to spend a lot of cash on a multi band radio , but want to be able to listen to stations wherever you may travel , the sg622 should work well for you .
it is got everything i needed in a compact battery powered radio
as others have noted , the tuning floats a little over time , but the sw and am and fm bands work fine
good for the garage or working in the yard .
this is a sized portable with a very basic design
it can tune <NUM> shortwave broadcast bands but none of the ham or utility frequencies between
its performance on all bands is decent , especially compared to other small portables
it covers more shortwave bands than many
sound is not great , but again , it is good compared to others in this class
i would recommend it as a radio to pack along on trips
it works fairly well and can be had cheaply enough that if it were lost or stolen it wouldn not ruin your life
it would also be good for those , including the visually impaired , who have difficulty running a general coverage set with a digital display
or for those who just don not want to .
this little radio has superb sensitivity on all bands
you will be impressed by the high fidelity output from the internal speaker
there are <NUM> sw bands and an additional <NUM> for am/fm so there is plenty of content
overall , the radio feels solid , antenna and knobs are good quality
it is powered by <NUM> aa batteries but also will run on an a 4
5 volt adapter ( not included )
range and performance of this sw radio rivals units costing much more
a great choice for getting into sw and it is price won not set you back .
this radio was a disapointment
i live <NUM> miles outside of chicago , so i am not in one of the most challenging areas , such as in the loop or in downtown ny
the fm band could only reach the very strongest stations , and not the weaker ones as i'd hoped
i guess it comes down to this : that you get what you pay for
this inexpensive radio was unremarkable ; as matter of fact i actually couldn not receive that many shortwave stations either .
i bought this radio as a replacement for the kaito ka11 , which inexplicably stopped working in the am/mw band and gave me concerns about kaito is quality control
this is a basic shortwave/fm/am radio , large enough to provide decent sound yet small and light enough to fit into a backpack
as i am going on a trip to asia and will be going to places where shortwave radios are banned , it is also cheap enough to leave behind somewhere
there aren not many bells and whistles on this model : no exact frequency readout , no sleep timer , no alarm , no presets , no "wide" or "narrow" filter , no treble and bass settings , no external antenna jack , no tuning outside the basic fm/am and shortwave broadcast bands ; not even a carrying case
it has a headphone jack and input for a/c outlet and that is about it
i compared it to my sony and found the sensitivity to be about equal
i was able to tune into the usual shortwave powerhouses : china radio international , radio bulgaria , radio havana cuba , radio canada international and voa africa service without much effort
the sony obviously provides better selectability though ; the sangean had far more interference from adjacent stations
this sangean , like all analogue models , also suffered from frequency drift and had to be from time to time
build quality is fair
it is light enough not to add much additional weight to my backpack , but as others have noted , the knobs are flimsy
speaker quality is good
it is not too tinny sounding
if you are looking for a cheap , small , light travel radio , or a backup radio for emergencies , this is the radio for you
if you are interested in shortwave dxing ( viz
, listening to long distance stations as a hobby ) this radio may be too limiting and frustrating
if you intend to give this radio heavy or rough usage , it may not last .
i am very pleased with the quality and performance of this radio
for the money it is hard to beat
not a lot of features , but that is why other radios cost more
good reception
i recommend this radio .
i bought the radio shack version of this radio ( the ) just as something to hear what was available on the shortwave bands
i am new to shortwave listening and am so far impressed with what i have found so far with this radio , but it doesn not seem to have great selectivity
every station i have heard so far has at last <NUM> or <NUM> other stations bleeding into it , which makes it difficult to listen to certain stations sometimes
but for its tiny size and low price , it is a good deal .
i have had one of these receivers in my collection for about years
i have been worried it will stop working , so i looked around for a new one to replace it , found it and the price and delivery were great
radio arrived new and well packed exactly like i expected
nothing bad here , this purchase is all good .
this is a great radio
mine is about <NUM> years old
it is very easy to use
the only thing i do not like is that the sw band is not continuous
it is missing the ham frequencies .
if you are serious about shortwave , this isn not the radio you want , but this radio is great as a &quot ; do- &quot ; radio , or as a lightweight travel rig
it will will bring in the shortwave stations : bbc , radio netherlands , radio japan etc
sound quality is quite good
like most analog radios , knowing what frequency you are on is impossible , but for casual tuning , or to get a taste of what shortwave has to offer , this radio is fine
it is also small and light enough to make a decent travel portable ( and cheap enough that if you lose it , it is not the end of the world
) and , its a good radio to toss into your emergency preparedness kit
it will perform better with an external antenna &quot ; boost&quot ; - just take a 10'-30' piece of wire , attach a couple of alligator clips , and save yourself $15 by not buying a &quot ; reel in&quot ; antenna .
this is an "old fashioned" dial and pointer radio , lacking all of the features of a modern digital set
no preset stations , poor indication of the actual frequency that is tuned , no clock , no alarm
somehow , it is still great fun to use ! band scanning has been a weak point of digital radios
the sound is usually muted while slewing through the frequency range , leaving just a tuning indicator light to show that a station has been found ( most will not stop scanning on weak signals ) , or if not muted , a loud "chuffing" noise is produced as the frequencies are scanned
with this set you just turn the knob and listen for stations ! if you want to easily find , say the bbc on 5
975 mhz a digital radio will get you there much faster , but for scanning the band to see what is on , the old dial and pointer still works quite well ! for a similar but smaller and slightly less expensive radio , see my review of the kaito wrx911
for a more expensive radio with "double conversion" , which eliminates "false signals" on shortwave , see my review of the kaito ka1107 .
i own on of these and love it so much i got my brother one for christmas
though small , this radio has great reception of regular and shortwave channels , without any sort of cumbersome antenna wire to deal with
the batteries last a long , long time , even when i fell asleep and left it on all night a couple times
just don not break the antenna off right away , which i always seem to do ! anyone would have fun with this
( oh , and it is very sturdy
i actually did a human cannonball thing , diving face first onto mine , when holding onto the dog is leash as it saw a cat , and though i got a black eye , the radio was unscathed and still working great
perhaps you want to dip a toe in the waters of shortwave radio listening
in my case , i wanted to give my kids a different perspective of the world around them than that which comes from the cliches and stereotypes presented on tv and in the movies
i'd had a decent sangean shortwave a number of years ago but was hoping that as technology marches forward , decent functionality might be available in cheaper units
right off the bat , let is discard am ( medium wave ) and fm
those are commonly available
i have no interest in introducing my kids to the belligerents who populate the am band
there is no reason to listen to fm radio if someone has a decent cd collection for the car
even though the offers both am and fm , i bought this solely for the shortwave
taking a cue from other reviews here i expected that shortwave reception would be weak , but also expected that connecting this to the antenna that had been used with my component stereo system would significantly increase the number of listenable signals received
first i should say that without the external antenna this unit is a paperweight
listening at night as i used to do with the better shortwave receiver , the only thing this picked up in multiple listening sessions was three or four religious broadcasts that probably are readily available on am radio if the political blowhards haven not driven everybody else off the dial
adding the external antenna from the component stereo did make a significant difference in reception
more signals were indeed detected
unfortunately , the overwhelming majority of them were unlistenable
i am not a shortwave enthusiast so i am only speculating that what such listeners mean by "sensitivity" or "selectivity" is a radio is ability to home in on a signal while suppressing general static and noise
most of the time when some kind of signal would be detected , the delivered it as one chunk of coherent sound bobbing about in a sea of white noise
sifting through band after band of unlistenable signals turned up a handful of broadcasts that were coherent but significantly noisy
no radio australia or radio moscow or english language broadcasts from points around the globe , but rather , mostly just the occasional foreign language broadcast peppered in with the already mentioned doctrinal teachings
in short , the effort required wasn not worth the parsimonious results delivered
it is probably a safe guess that "drift" means either a signal slightly changing frequencies or a receiver is inability to stay locked onto a fixed signal
with the i found that signals repeatedly drifted , to where it was best if i kept one hand on the dial in an attempt to follow the signal is shifts one way or the other
never had to do that with the shortwave receiver i'd used in the past
listening to broadcasts from around the world can be a fascinating pastime , an activity to share with the kids
but if you want to stick a toe in those waters just to see how you like it , or how the kids take to it , without spending too much , this unit just isn not going to drum up any enthusiasm
it would be like buying a used yugo to see if calling the tow truck from the side of the road inspires your teen to take up driving
this fails the effort/reward equation , this fails the cost/reward equation , and even when it lands a signal , it is the audio equivalent of watching a snowy tv screen
don not abandon the idea of trying shortwave radio , but please , walk up the ladder to a better , higher priced model that will deliver enough listenability so that you or your kid can make an informed decision on pursuing this further .
this radio is a good deal
it compares to my rca globetrotter that gets good am reception
the performance is better then the radioshack whitch has synthesyzer or display noise whitch sucks not to mention that it mutes while scanning so if your blind do knot get this radio
the sangean is easy to use and if connected to a fence with wire shortwave performance gets even better
becarfull with the tuning becuss it can break[mine did] so i ordered another one
grait radio sangean !
have owned this little radio a few years
the tuning failed to work well within several weeks
it is a very cheap elastic string around a pulley and in colder weather
even 50 is
it loses friction and slips making tuning almost impossible
and yes , the volume knob is loose as mentioned by others
reception of fm and am are pretty good
there is only limited reception of shortwave with antenna fully extended and with trying to aim antenna to fine tune a station
so , if you leave your radio on a favorite station and the poor tuning mechanics aren not a bother this might be an acceptable choice
but radios half the price are around with no cheap mechanical parts
it is a shame they would use fairly good electronics but allow such cheap tuning and volume mechanicals to make the radio a poor choice .
i bought this radio hoping that it would improve reception in an interior bathroom where i take my morning shower
i like to listen to a local news station , traffic , weather etc , but we live in a very tough reception area near a tower that broadcasts many foreign language ( mostly korean and spanish , i think ) local stations that seem to overwhelm cheap a cheap radios' tuning ability
i have rarely been able to pull in our ( wtop , washington , dc ) local am news station , but this radio does a fine job
yes , it does indeed have an am band ( labeled as mw ) , contrary to some reviews , and does a great job
sound is quite good , and the unit is small , though not tiny , and surpringsly heavy for its size ( i
solid ) .
nice starter radio for sw lots of freq to tune , live near the beach and the many stationcome in ok ( not great ok ) hey its a nice starter radio , also bought the fr200 now thats great
a fellow reviewer named mary l
stein "talk show junkie" writes : > despite the advertising there is no am band on this radio ! this is quite untrue
this radio has am band , it is however labeled as "mw" ( as opposed to being labeled "am" )
"mw" stands for "medium wave" and is just another name for "am" ( which stands for amplitude modulation )
although labeled differently , it is quite obvious once one uses this radio that mw are the am stations .
i first encountred this radio when sold under the radio shack brand as the in alamogordo , otero county , n
we are at the base of the sacramento mtns
, in the white sands basin
i wanted a small radio i could take hiking in the sacramentos , and this one fit the bill for size
i was amazed at how it could pull signals in the canyons of the mountains on all bands
it is remarkably durable , surviving a <NUM> foot fall and an auto wreck and kept on working
it finally gave up the ghost , and i hunted for years to find another
well here it is
anyone who wants a quality reciever comparable in all ways to the grundig will find this little radio to fill the bill
for the money , you cant beat it ! [asin : b0000228gf sangean fm <NUM> band shortwave world band radio
love this very good to have no power works on battery has different channels good to have around use it for home and traveling camping
i wasn not able to get any of the major shortwave channels like voice of america and radio europe and bbc but the fmband works pretty good .
i have long been a shortwave fan , but the price of shortwave units has seemed prohibitive to me until i found this sangean unit
the reception is surprisingly good for something so small and portable
it is attractive enough enough that i can leave it in the guest bedroom , on the nightstand for the use of my guests , and small enough that i can take it with me when i travel
naturally you are not going to get a lot of power out of it , but i have had much larger , more expensive shortwave units which performed at about the same level , so i have no complaints with the sangean
it was a good buy .
just okay in my opinion , i got this radio to be able to listen to npr and bbc news at home
reception in my home in santa fe , new mexico is just okay , not great , pretty fuzzy most of the time
a little disappointing , but since it was inexpensive , no great loss
maybe it will work better in other places .
this is a very good radio for folks just entering the world of shortwave listening
the radio has a very good sound from the built in speaker and the tuner on am/fm and sw seem to be pretty good
i have compared this radio to the popular sony sw11 which is sony is analog mulitband equivalent
the sangean has much better sound and about the same level of selectivity from the tuner
the sangean is also about $20 cheaper
my only knock on this radio is that even though the tried to keep the price down a telescoping antenna would have been nice
other than that no real complaints
a very good buy !
receives wonderfully , but cheaply made
hope volumn knob stays on for a while
i listen to sw since i was <NUM> years old and still remembering all frequencies for some stations that no longer around
this radio is very high quality , solid and precise
the sw on low/high band is very efficient and sound is very good
as one should understand , any radio is as good as radio conditions are
the time , weather , solar activity they all affect sw waves
if you know what you do and have a good antenna this radio outperforms anything in reachable price range
the memory banks ( 231 of them ) are very well organized , allow banks and automatic scanning through the range and auto selection through the bank frequencies
this is one very smart radio
i purchased mine in <NUM> and still no other radio can challenge this brick despite near <NUM> years have passed since .
first let me say that it is certainly not deaf at all on the extremely long whip as stated in many other reviews , but it is certainly better with either a passive ( as supplied with the radio ) or an active antenna attached ( such as the kaito ka33 or kaito ka35 )
! now on sale at amazon for only $ 219
99 , it is an excellent bargain ( including shipping )
i have only had my unit for two weeks , but overall i find it to be an excellent and very intuitive and much better sounding radio than the famous sony ( which i have also used for over a year ) and i find the reception comparable , but the sangean is much more intuitive and user friendly to operate even without the touted sony synchronous detection circuit
the ability to be able to quickly change bands from lw to mw ( am ) to sw and to fm , etc
and in any order for example on the sangean is an excellent feature set unlike the sony where during automatic band scanning you will get "stuck" in a single band until the choice of am ( this includes lw , mw and sw all in a single choice- for further details , please see my separate review of that sony radio on amazon ) or fm is selected or unless a digital frequency is separated entered
update : january 19 , radio system is really fabulous and easily worth double the cost of a new sony for example
it certainly works better on a passive or active antenna system or on the included ac/dc adaptor as well , but it does work great even on the whip in my subjective opinion
the ability with the simple and very straightforward and easy to operate page system to be able to quickly pull out prerecorded station frequencies from numerous countries all over the world is a fabulous and very well implimented idea
once all the numerous bells and whistles are understood by a beginner they could more easily enjoy this approach on this radio as well as on simpler introductory models as well ( such as on the or )
they have even included the usb/lsb ( upper or lower designators ) and ssb ( band ) in the prerecorded frequenices in the numerous list of available stations
furthermore the system knows automatically and loads this detailed information in the detection algorithm as well
anyway even without synchronous detection as on the sony , i am definitely hooked on this new sangean
try it , you will like it too ! it is great fun to use and enjoy
thanks very much for helping me decide on this particular one steve ! what a birthday gift ! i have only three very small criticisms so far and i will update this review as i continue to regularly use ( see above ) the on all of the available bands : 1 ) the sangean really needs a carrying handle to be installed either on the unit itself ( there is not even a carrying strap ) or one at least on the fine case that is provided
a friend of mine has one that he really loves and takes everywhere , but it is now held together with duct tape ( and still works perfectly even after being repeatedly dropped )
2 ) if the unit gets totally reset for some reason ( i have only read about this problem ) , the unit will reverts to the asian list of internal preset stations and has to be sent back to the sangean factory to be reprogrammed
this process should be certainly be available instead using the computer link on the bottom of the sangean as a software download on the internet just like upgrading a computer or pda , cell phone bios or other such system
3 ) the switches on the right hand side of the unit are a little too small for easy and efficient operation of the radio
fortunately the ssb ( single ) switch is directly on the front of the unit and is very easy to control once the main tuning knob is put into the slow mode so that the bfo ( beat frequency oscillator ) can be readily adjusted to the position of zero beats , i
, so that the voice transmissions sound ( pun intended ) completely normal .
this is a decent radio
it sounds good and has a plethora oftuning features
but , it is expensive and offers only mediocreperformance for the money
for a bunch less cash you can have a more sensitive , moreportable radio , the sony sw7600gr
while it doesn not soundas nice as the sangean , it will pull in many more signals , has better ssb performance , plus has synchronous detectionwhich locks in signals and reduces noise and interference
amazon is price on the sony is almost $100 us less than thesangean
the sony is the absolute best value in this classof receiver .
i purchased this radio several years ago and found it to be a really fine performer
excellent sw sensitivity , good am and excellent fm as well
considering the ats 909 is rather small size
sound is quite good , too , for it is size
and it is got a fine assortment of settings/buttons for improved performance
the big problem was that it didn not hold up well over the long haul
firstly , the numbers/letters on the buttons that i used most often rubbed off , including the silver paint underneath , and became totally illegible
then , about a year and a half after purchase , the digital clock refused to hold the correct time
i had it repaired but the clock went bad once again a few months later
and lastly , the speaker went bad , giving only fuzzy , low fidelity sound
it is now , essentially , unusable
were it not for the abovementioned problems , i'd rate it five stars
at the fairly high selling price of around $250 , the ats <NUM> should hold up for a lot longer than it did
i guess that these days , quality and durability of most electronic goods just aren not as competent as they once were
sigh .
is the sangean the same as the sangean ? specifications on the sangean website indicate there are some similarities
personally , i can only attest to the features and functionality of the former
as the owner of a sangean , which was purchased in late <NUM> with the wide ( w ) fm band ( 76 to <NUM> mhz ) , i suspect they are pretty much the same
both dual conversion pll models share the same frequency range , the same clock/dual time , the same narrow/wide filters , the same audio switches , the same output jacks , the same usb/lsb in <NUM> hz , the same eeprom memory backup , the same tuning capability , the same alphanumeric tagging of stations , and the same rds readings for the fm band
aside from the attractive and updated design , the sangean features <NUM> memories as opposed to <NUM> on the
power can now accommodate rechargeable nicd batteries , which is a major improvement compared to the sangean
audio is boosted from <NUM> mw to 1
5 w when ac power is applied , much like my old grundig yacht boy 500
an individual headphone amplifier is now featured
it has a longer whip antenna , i suppose to address the poor reception the reportedly had off its whip
weight and physical dimensions are more or less the same
performance ? i would venture a guess and say they are probably about the same , considering they share pretty much the same processor and some internal configuration
my own experience with the sangean is excellent
i find the ability to hear weak stations amidst the static on the bands is slightly better than my grundig satellit <NUM> radio/tecsun and grundig satellit 500 , but only when using the headphones
i hasten to add its lower floor noise is only better on certain frequencies ; on some frequencies the grundig satellit 750/tecsun and grundig satellit <NUM> either equalled or outperformed it when utilising the same external antenna
i would say the sangean has better filtering than the grundig satellit 750/tecsun when eliminating stronger adjacent stations
but then , the grundig satellit <NUM> blows away both due to its synchronous demodulator
as far as actual performance from my location in malaysia , the sangean matches the grundig 750/tecsun in receiving stations in tunisia , morocco , libya , egypt , israel , chad , darfur , south sudan , zimbabwe , swaziland , south africa , eritrea , ethiopia , bahrain , oman , kuwait , saudi arabia , iran , turkey , greece , macedonia ( northern greece ) , brazil , cuba , usa ( wwvh in hawaii , wewn in alabama and wwcr in tennessee , knls in alaska ) , canada , ireland , uk , sweden , spain , portugal , france , ascension island ( family radio relay station ) , holland , germany , vatican , austria , poland , moldova , serbia , czech republic , slovakia , bulgaria , albania , romania , russia , afghanistan , kurdistan ( northern iraq ) , pakistan , sri lanka , india , tibet , china , taiwan , mongolia , north korea , south korea , japan , myanmar , bangladesh , thailand , vietnam , indonesia , philippines , solomon islands , guam , pulau , australia , new zealand and sarawak ( malaysia )
two negative issues often highlighted about the sangean is the high battery consumption and deafness off the whip antenna
this definitely is the case with my radio
i generally use rechargeable batteries or ac power
the whip antenna is never used
instead i have it hooked to an external 1/4 wave antenna , which is linked to about <NUM> meters of <NUM> ohm coaxial cable and fed through an antenna tuner
the sangean obviously addresses these issues with rechargeable batteries and a longer whip
and from the reviews i have read , a few owners of both radios have noticed an improvement
overall , i am very much impressed with the sangean
i use it regularly in my dxing and find it has been more than adequate when the other radios just couldn not handle the task at hand
it is not a receiver , but for its price it is a powerful portable radio .
i own a sony , grundig yb400 and just purchased the
of the three i would give the the lowest score
it definitely lacks the sensitivity of the other two
( though connecting an external antenna helps greatly but defeats the purpose of a portable radio
) and i find the audio quality to be muddled and tiring to listen to
if you are looking for a good portable i would also recommend the grundig yb400 or the new sony .
if you are really interested in what shortwave radio has to offer , this is the radio to get
there are better models , but for this price , it is second to none
good sensitivity , adequate selectivity ( ability to separate signals from one another ) and lots of bells and whistles
covers all the shortwave specturm
numerous ways to tune stations , the best of which is the keypad input
digital readout eliminates guesswork as to what frequency you are on
fm tends to overload in urban areas with lots of fm signals
the only real downside to this radio is it can be pretty complicated to operate
plan on spending some time going through the manual and figuring out all the features
if you live outside of europe or the east coast of north american , you will likely need to use an external antenna
<NUM> feet of wire with alligator clips on each end should do the trick .
i had this model up until two years when my wife got mad at me one time and threw it across the room ( about <NUM> ft )
needless to say , the radio assumed room temperature : ) it gave up the ghost ! however , it is definately solidly built and is absolutely loaded with almost every feature a shortwave listener would want
even ssb ( single sideband ) reception by using a built in bfo ( beat frequency oscillator switch for upper
and lower sideband ! rf gain switch is handy when you are close to an a
with headphones you can listen to stereo fm
get this radio if you are serious about shortwave
and get the portable roll up antenna for really improving sw reception
this radio has my very highest recommendatiion ! oh
i am getting a new one sometime soon to replace the one that went airborne for about a second !
i was a little nervous about spending $200+ on a portable receiver
after having and using the for a full week i am <PERCENT> happy with it
my other ( quality ) receiver is a grundig satellit 800 , that i had bought refurbished two years ago
the has much better sensitivity than my grundig with a <NUM> foot long wire antenna at 15
000 mhz where i just compared them
the grundig is better , with its built in whip antenna , but the comes in a respectable second there , in my book
it also has the best sound i have ever heard from a radio this size
ssb sounds better than some ham rigs i have listened to
mine came with an ac adapter and <NUM> foot , windup , long wire antenna
i use nimh <NUM> mha rechargable batteries , so the adapter is not necessary for me
excellent portable sw/am/fm receiver , i am happy ! ken
first a disclaimer : i own the c
crane "super 909" and not the standard unit
i use this radio far more than any radio i own
i have an office that is partially below ground and a very difficult am reception area
i telecommute a lot and i listen to talk radio while i work , and this radio gets me through the day
one neat feature is the variable sensitivity knob on the left side of the radio lets me turn the sensitivity down and rotate the radio in order to determine the exact direction a weak am signal is coming from
this way i can position the radio for optimum reception
once in position i turn the sensitivity back up again
here is one thing you might not have read about this radio in any other review : it is a great help with ebay
that is right , those three separate timers on this unit combined the military <NUM> hour clock allow me to look right at an auction end time ( which is in <NUM> hour format ) , punch in a time about five minutes before that , and let the radio tell me when to get in front of my computer and get ready to win that auction
and , i can set up to three different timers at the same time
you don not need the "super" version to enjoy this feature
( yes , i know that is probably not what the designers of this radio had in mind
) the downside is that the one thing this radio is supposed to excel in ( especially the "super" version ) it simply doesn not , at least not for me
i once ran a simple wire out of a cheap analogue sw portable down here in the basement and got a lot of sw stations from overseas , like japan and tiawan , but this radio can not pick up what that cheap radio could in the very same location and with a better antenna setup
i don not get it
also , the volume is broken or somehow doesn not work in such a way as to allow me to turn the volume down very quiet
i actually have to run the volume a bit louder than i want because i can not turn it down
i am way too much of a cheapskate to pay to get this fixed
finally , i actually bought this slightly used ( but practically new , it was pristine ) , so i didn not pay full price
if i had , and i was a real sw enthusiast , i would probably have been disappointed
so three stars because from my expreience it does not excel at what is supposed to be its specialty ( and i have got the "hot rodded" version ) , and its a rather expensive radio
personally , i love it but i am only using a fraction of the functionality that people typically buy a radio like this for .
i am kind of collector of portable radios
when i read about the 909 , it seemed to me like the definitive portable ( i don not like the 'other definitive , sony 2100 )
so , i bought it from amazon ( good price and reliable store ) and as soon as it was delivered to me i benchmarked it against the first radio i got on hand : a modest fifteen years old phillips compass
well , to my surprise , the phillips showed twice as sensitive as the sangean
even with the sangean is whip full extended , and the phillips' one totally folded , the phillips clearly outperformed the 909
when switched to an external antenna , the sangean improved <PERCENT> , but the point is , what a portable means ? why such a good radio performs so poor with such a long whip antenna ? if you need the receiver to carry it around while travelling , then check the sony 7600g or grundig yb400pe ( both with superior performance as portable )
otherwise , with an ext
antenna , the radio is an excellent receiver
the fm capture is superb , as well as the ssb legibility
the sound is quite good , even if not as good as the grundig is .
 <NUM> years ago i had a cheap portable shortwave radio that never picked up a single station
so , when i bought this radio , i was optimistic , and yet skeptical about any results
so , i am a world band newbie , and this seemed about the right amount of money to spend on a first radio
here is the exciting news - within <NUM> minutes of unpacking this fine little radio , i was listening to radio havana , then radio netherlands , and then
well , you get the idea
success was a matter of attaching the external wire antenna , hitting two buttons and turning up the volume , thanks to the stations in the memory - over <NUM> of them
in minutes i had been around the world and was now scanning the bands on my own
i'd call that instant gratification
here is three things i really liked and i think will be attractive to a prospective purchaser
although the radio is complex with lots of features and buttons , the buttons make sense - the interface to use the radio is almost intuitive
you can not say that about most modern products with lots of buttons
the tuning features are fantastic
you can directly enter a frequency using the pad , you can quickly choose a "band" to search manually , you can have the unit "scan" automatically and stop on strong stations , or you can manually rotate the tuning dial which has two granularities - fine and course
the tuning dial is detented and feels great
the regular am/fm performance is excellent
using the and store feature , the unit quickly found and stored all the best signal am/fm stations
fm was clear , clean , stereo and sounded superb on headphones
and , i easily tuned my favorite am station from <NUM> miles away
here is what i did not like
the volume knob is too sensitive at the bottom of the range
cracking it open more than a hair was too loud on my headphones
there are some tiny switches on the side ( little used , i presume ) which can only be operated with a pencil point , not a finger
3 ) the display is an ugly green color which seems very old and archaic , although it was reasonable visible
4 ) setting the world time ( utc ) seems impossible
i finally had to settle for setting local time to world time
i am not sure why that was so confusing
5 ) the plastic case appears to be a bit delicate
this is not a radio you want to drop on the floor by accident
i can not speak for the technical performance about reception , gain , selectivity and such , because i am not experienced and this is my first radio
however , it easily tunes stations from around the world and i thought the sound quality was superb
it is easy to operate ( i was even able to operate it in the dark ) and brought satisfying results for about $225
i am enjoying it and feel it was a sound purchase .
this is the exact same radio when it comes to reception as the sangean ats <NUM> it just has more "bells and whistles" .
i spent much time researching various makes and models of sw radios before making purchase of the sangean
i have had and/or currently own several radios , ranging from portable sony&<HASHTAG> ; s , to very low cost china export models , to full blown ham radios such as the desktop yaesu 847
in short , i rate the sangean ! it is uncomplicated and very easy to use after reading the brief manual and spending some time getting to know the radio
i simply love the <NUM> memories and the tagging of stations
this is the primary reason i purchased the radio &<HASHTAG> ; i want pushbutton convenience to the stations i listen to the most &<HASHTAG> ; and i want to see the name of the station ( which you can easily create )
performance wise , i rate the sangean as follows : fm =
i live in the sticks , but even away fm stations come in with relative ease ( even with the antenna collapsed , although the antenna should be extended for clearest reception )
am = 4
5 stars
all of the mw stations come in fine , and you should have no problem hearing all of your favorite stations , although there may be some noise on the weaker stations
as with all radios , for sw listening , you will need to steer clear of electrical noise sources such as lamp dimmers , motors , and other sources of noise
keep in mind that there will be very limited reception when indoors
this is true with all radios
when i moved outdoors and connected the included wire antenna , reception was strong on all sw bands
in fact , the wire antenna outperforms the whip antenna by a slight margin ( it should , too , being long ! )
the sangean preloaded memories really make listening for a particular county or station a pleasure ; it&<HASHTAG> ; s really cool to select which country you wish to listen to , and to further select from a list of stations from that country
the tonal quality and volume are more than adequate
the overall features of the sangean , compared with other radios , are simply superb
the overall build quality is excellent
this is a fine looking radio with a big , informative lcd display and great features
i have read on how this radio will quickly drain batteries , so i simply keep it connected to the wall transformer &<HASHTAG> ; no big deal .
i have had a <NUM> for <NUM> years
it is gotten several thousand hours of use , has fallen on the floor a few times , and is still going strong
it is very true that this radio is hard of hearing using its whip antenna
it has inferior sensitivity
i just bought a $20 analog sw radio which is vastly more sensitive
you must add your own external antenna
the reel antenna will do nicely
after that , the <NUM> truly performs
it can hear everything then
the speaker is also poor
it has inferior sound
again , the $20 analog i bought has vastly superior sound to the 909
the sound on the <NUM> is disappointing
i only ever listen to it using headphones
the <NUM> has a tuning knob , which is much better than up/down buttons for tuning
you can tune in <NUM> khz increments
that is fine for sw
the narrow/wide filters are okay
not great
using the narrow filter and tuning away from an interfering station can help with the interference
the tuning for ssb is unacceptable
ssb should not sound like donald duck in a radio with this price
if you rip off the display glass , you can adjust the bfo screw and almost get ssb to
i prefer the bfo knob on the yb 400pe to what the <NUM> has
poor ssb performer
the sound mutes when you tune
that is bad
i ripped my radio apart and modded the radio so it would not mute
the radio frequently beeps when you press buttons
this is annoying
i ripped my radio apart and removed the beep speaker
the memory function is very nice
nearly <NUM> pages of <NUM> memories each
most of them are preprogrammed and out of date
you have to find a cheat online to bypass the memory lock so you can store your own countries and frequencies
decent fm and mw reception
mw dxers will not be disappointed
no drm
this is an old radio
if you want drm , you need to do another mod , buy a mixer/filter chip , pipe the signal into your computer , and decode it with the appropriate software
no synchronous detection
at this price , the radio really should have had sync
it makes a huge difference in terms of listenability
sync completely removes adjacent interference and fading distortion
if you listen to sw you want it
the <NUM> doesn not have it
i like the 909
but i must suggest you get the sony instead
it is much cheaper
it has much better sensitivity
it has much better sound
it has synchronous detection
or if your focus is ssb , get the grundig yacht boy 400pe
it is cheaper , has better sound , and ssb
sorry , but your radio is greatly outclassed by the competition .
the sangean ats <NUM> is my very favorite radio
and that is saying a lot , since i have quite a few different models
the <NUM> is fairly easy to use , once you carefully study the manual a few times
it is by no means a simple unit - having a number of bells and whistles - but the ergonomics seem to be quite sensible
covering the shortwave band is as easy as it possibly could be , thanks to the key pad entry , scanner , tuning wheel , and memory presets
i find this not to be the case with some popular shortwave radios , such as the rp2100/
the sensitivity and selectivity of the am and shortwave bands are very good , even when only the whip antenna is used
in fact , i have compared the am reception with that of the ccradio plus , and found them to be nearly equal - the ccradio plus having only a slight edge
however , the <NUM> aided by the kaito ka35 active loop antenna is a superb combination , if you want the best reception
on fm , i find the reception to be excellent as well
and as for the shortwave band - pages of nine presets each , each page able to be titled by the user ! that is more than enough memory for an amateur
the lsb and usb also perform very well , and allow you to listen to truck and ham transmissions
the tone of the speaker is quite good for a radio of this small size , and probably better than many portables
some , though , may find it a bit flat on am and shortwave
it seems to sound best on the fm band
i find it especially nice for classical music played at a soft to moderate volume
an output on the left side of the radio allows you to run the signal through an external speaker system , for even better sound quality
the <NUM> rests on a small folding stand which pulls out from the back
as an improvement on this , i would suggest using a plastic radio stand from universal radio
this addition will hold the radio at an angle that is much easier for viewing the display , and will help to make the <NUM> a practical desk or bedside radio
however , the numerals indicating the time of day ( in format , rather than 12 ) - although they are always displayed - are rather small for reading late at night
at two in the morning , it is difficult to focus on such tiny digits hiding in an olive green lit display
the beeper alarm is also rather soft
if you are a heavy sleeper with less than perfect eyesight , this radio may not suffice for the bedside
again , i have used quite a few different radios , and the <NUM> remains my favorite , alongside the ccradio plus
i would rate it as an excellent portable , the very best for sitting down late at night and running through the various bands until your wife says , "come to bed ; it is late ! " in fact , i have two ( two 909 is , that is , not two wives ) - one being the "super" 909
i would highly recommend either version to any one who takes seriously
of all the models i have used , the <NUM> is the easiest and most capable and enjoyable one
and although it may not perfectly suffice as a bedside model , it makes an ideal desk radio , especially since its <NUM> 1/2" body takes up so little space
finally , i have had my original <NUM> for since about 2004 , and it has never given me any problems
the digits in the display window work fine , as well as every other function on the radio
from reading many other reviews , i'd say the consensus is that this radio is well built and durable
yes , it is expensive ; but if radio is important to you , then the <NUM> will certainly be worth the price
it is a means as useful as the internet - and far more convenient - for keeping informed in these worrisome times
[note on the "super" 909] after buying and liking very much the regular sangean <NUM> radio , i learned of the "super" <NUM> model , which costs an additional $100
i carefully researced and considered this modified version for over a year before i finally decided to buy one
after comparing the two , however , i have to pass on my opinion that the "super" <NUM> may not be worth the inflated price
the radio is sensitivity is admittedly improved , though not drastically
the tone of the speaker is brighter and clearer , especially on am and shortwave , but it is also more tinny than the original , while the bass response is in no way improved
all considered , this amounted to an expensive and unexpected disappointment , especially considering the glowing review i had read on a certain radio web site , which originally persuaded me to buy the super model
in fact , in some ways i actually like the older model is tone better ; it is warmer , and better suited for music
the most outstanding improvement is in the color of the display light , which is now a brilliant blue when the radio is plugged in , but faint blue when running on batteries
oh yes , i am quite pleased with that modification
but even in these environmentally correct times , i wouldn not spend $100 on a blasted light bulb ! so , if you are tormenting over whether or not to spring for the "super" 909 , perhaps you should at least lower your expectations
like myself , you might like the older less expensive model just as well , or even better
[update] after using the "super" <NUM> as a bedside radio , i have to correct my opinion of the neon blue light
it may be beautiful in the daylight , but it is far too bright at night
at <NUM> am , this lighted window will simply burst you eyeballs
and the last thing your eyes will be able to withstand in the wee hours of the morning is a focused search for the tiny digits that indicate the time , nevermind the even smaller alarm symbol
in the end , the colored light that sangean originally provides is the best and easiest way to view the display at all hours
[second update] sangean has updated the <NUM> with the new "909x" .
hello folks its vince the radioman , i have been a radio buff for many many years with a vast collection
i love to do compares
the sangean <NUM> is a very very good radio
the tuner is of top quality and the overall performance is consistant with the sony <NUM>
this radios best quality is its construction and the sound quality
it has the best built in speaker i have ever heard in a " portable " radio
it is very durable but a bit heavy in weight
it is loaded with extras like a line out , ext antenna jack and a really nice ssb set up
the am and sw sections are very good
in its class the only better radio is the sony <NUM> because of its outstanding tuner , however , the tuner in the <NUM> is very good
all in all the <NUM> is probably the best all around radio in its class due to the sound quality and the diverse functionality ( extensive memory and a wonderful visual display window )
its a little expensive and as i stated before a bit heavy but a great radio .
this is a nice little switch
it has a rugged case , rear ports , and frontside link lights
it took about <NUM> seconds to replace my base10 hub with this device and it has been silently blinking along ever since .
does what a ethernet switch should
nice 10/100 indicator lights
i plugged this switch into another switch to add more ports in my wife is office
no crossing cables required
i recommend this switch
please note that i bought mine "used" for under $10 , which is about the max i would ever pay for a <NUM> port switch .
i have this little switch installed under my desk to connect my pc and various peripherals ( external hard drive , printer , fax , etc
has given me years of reliable service .
i have been using this switch for over two years now and have never had any kind of problem
it is a great little switch that is definitely worth the money
all the ports are in the back , the casing has a brushed aluminum look , and it is fanless , so it is definitely possible to leave it sitting on the desk
since the "switching fabric" supports 1gb/sec , that means each of the five ports can carry their full 200mb/sec ( 100mb/sec each way ) capacity without problem
the darn thing doesn not even get warm
definitely a good buy ( i rate it at <NUM> stars out of 5 )
one note : if i were to buy another switch today , i'd probably go for the 10/100/1000 version of the same switch ( the )
darn near every computer sold these days has a gigabit ethernet connection built into it
so , having that switch would most likely let people take advantage of the added speed on their local networks ( assuming they had cat 5e or cat <NUM> cabling -- however , it wouldn not make any difference across the internet since only a rare few cable modem even connect at 100mb/sec and i don not know of any that connect at <NUM> gb/sec )
but , since that switch costs about twice as much as this one , there is a bit of a .
i have been using this switch ever since i bought it years ago and it has been fully functional .
hurrah ! not much to report except that it is as painless as technology will ever get
you plug it in and now you have more ports
success !
i have typically been a linksys only customer , but being frustrated with some of their products lately i decided to make a switch , and i am glad i did
it is compact design makes it easy to tuck it away
i have yet to have a problem with the <NUM> that i bought , one for home and one for work
they have been running <NUM> months and counting with all the ports active in both locations .
this is a great swicth with low price
i use it together with internet sharing router to build my home network with <NUM> pc , two servers , one powermac and a laptop connected to cable modem isp
connecting via the swicth for internet sharing doesn not show any noticeable as compared to connecting via the router directly
it works well by itself as we as with .
i just took this out of the box and had it installed in less than five minutes - seriously
i was a little surprised at first because it is only a little larger than the size of a deck of cards
so i took out the included ac adapter and plugged it into the hub and into my powerstrip
then i plugged the included usb cable into my computer is usb port and into the hub
windows <NUM> recognized the new hardware and installed it with the windows <NUM> cd in about twenty seconds
then i plugged in my intellimouse optical and my intel camera and windows installed them as well and i was all set
five minutes after opening the box ! so these are the great things about it
easy to install : literally five minutes
great size : not much larger than a deck of cards
great price : pci usb ports cost twice as much
works great : four devices can be plugged into the space of one of your computers usb ports
a great buy !
i first went to local retailers to comparison shop and found competitive products generally priced two to three times as much
so , i decided to give the a try
i powered down my hewlett packard running windows me and installed the new hardware
i chose to use the optional ac power adapter , because i was hooking up the &quot ; viking - intelliflash smart card reader&quot ; and wanted to ensure enough power
upon rebooting windows me automatically recognized the product and installed the required driver
i verified the installation under &quot ; control panel/system/universal serial bus controllers
&quot ; it was newly listed as a &quot ; general purpose usb hub
&quot ; i can not imagine anyone having problem adding this hub to his or her existing system
i give it a perfect <NUM> for ease of installation and excellent value .
when the number of usb devices here exceded the number of ports on my dell dimension , i shopped around for a <NUM> port usb hub
this unit looked appealing ; not only did it come with a <NUM> foot usb cable , it could be powered by the computer usb port or from it is own wall wart power supply
when it arrived , it was an easy and straight forward install
plug the supplied cable into the hub , plug the hub into the computer is usb port , plug the devices into the hub , you are done
turning the computer is power on , five leds lit up green
one led for each port and one showing the hub is running from the computer is power supply
a red led lights to show when the hub is wall wart is supplying the power
elegant simplicity in a translucent package , the most difficult thing to expect in setting this up is opening the blister pack to get at it .
i have had this for awhile and have not had any problems
i have a camera and some other things plugged into it
it is nice not having to worry about running out of usb connections .
i bought this hub several months ago and i am extremely pleased with its performance and looks
i am very pleased with its esthetic looks due to the clear case
one nice surprise was the fact that included with the usb hub was a power cable
this allows the hub to power the devises instead of siphoning power from your computer is motherboard
this helps keep your power hungry devices happy
i would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a good usb hub not only for its esthetics but for also its supreme performance for such a great price .
i have owned this hub for about a year
for the most part , i was very satisfied with the hub when i was only using a couple of usb devices going into the hub
however , i recently bought a usb
on top of a printer , usb keyboard , etc
the was just too much
i agree with the other reviewer , just spend an extra few bucks and get a robust hub that will last you a while , through multiple upgrades .
i could not get this thing to work
tried it on windows xp , 2000 , and 98se
windows simply will not recognize this device
i work in a tech support center and have fairly technical skills
i have also had other technically adept people look at it , with same results
i will try belkin or linksys now but i'd steer clear of this item .
this hub is really very easy to install
plug it and you are done ! the ac adapter is included in case the devices need more power
it can be used without the adapter as well
it looks great , it is very small so it doesn not occupied precious space and it is affordable .
no real problems getting this to work
my only gripe is that it &quot ; seems&quot ; to slow the boot up of windows by a good <NUM> or <NUM> seconds
otherwise a great product at a great price !
plug it in and plug in your usb accessories and it works like a charm
no more fumbling in the back of your pc box to pull out the usb connector of an accessory you are not using to plug in one you want to use
the connections are in the front of the dlink box
good price compared to linksys , belkin and other competitive models
i am quite happy i bought this hub .
there is not much to say about this product
i just plugged it in and instantly forgot about it ! i was a bit skeptical because most usb hubs tend to be a bit pricier , but the hub works great and it can not get any easier to set it up
i love the compact design as well
this one is definately a .
this hub was a great value
i was suprised how much usb hubs go for , and this one represents an incredible value for someone who just wants a simple small usb hub
the hub itself is small and attractive , with lots of leds to light it up , and the now so popular translucent stlying
set up was a breeze , plug it in and your good to go
the hub also supports or operation
this means if like me your hooking up small low power devices to it , you don not have to plug it in ! the user guide is a little lacking , and the retail packaging is a little plain , but if you can live with that , this is an exceptional value .
this is an excellent product
installation was super easy
performance is flawless
it is pretty nice not having to pull my computer out of it is corner and try to find usb ports in the dark
even if you don not need extra ports it is nice to have them all out front .
1 : remove ( tiny , transparent ) device from box
2 : connect /w good quality ( supplied ) usb cable to pc
3 : connect up to <NUM> usb devices to hub
4 : get to work
it is really that simple
it has <NUM> green status leds ( 1 for each usb port and <NUM> for power on )
it also has a transformer for external power , which is only needed if your usb device draws a lot of power ( like a usb digital camera )
this is a great peripheral at a great price .
simple to hook up and use
includes an external power supply that the instructions say is optional , but that should be used
the usb subsystem provides power to many of the accessories that attach to it ( card readers , etc
) if you don not use the power supply , attaching more than two devices will overtax the usb system and stop all devices from working
so use the power supply immediately and you are all set
great value , led is show port status .
the standard of <NUM> usb ports for computers isn not really enough
i have a pda cradle , webcam , intellimouse explorer , scanner , and a zip <NUM> drive that all use usb ports , and it gets to be a hassle having to switch them around all the time
hub works great , i reccommend it
i am revising my rating downward after failing to get my printer to operate consistently with this hub despite its bulky and power supply
when i switched to a lighter asante hub , i no longer had any problems
maybe the problem was in my usb cable , because the seems to be a solid , piece of equipment
the price is right , so you could do worse than give it a try for yourself
the hub initially worked fine with my imac for lighter tasks
but as harry carey would say whenever a fly ball fell short of the bleachers , one more biscuit for breakfast might have insured a home run
lately i am finding that print jobs involving photos are requiring me to unplug the printer from the hub and directly into the usb port of the computer
occasionally , the unit causes everything to freeze when attached to its power supply , then resumes functionality when i unplug its electrical source ( the instructions claim the unit is <NUM> times more powerful when run by electricity )
fortunately , at these prices you can afford to just toss it and try something else .
this is a terrific value ! i have expanded my laptop is single usb port into four - quickly and easily
even though i had read some mixed reviews , my experience has been very positive so far ! you really don not need to spend more money on another hub - this one is a great value , reliable and is too
i wouldn not think twice about buying this product .
yes , it greatly improves reception when attached to a telescopic antenna using the included clip
it gave me air traffic and sw
wish it came with bnc adaptor though
good for the price for a lazy guy like me
i guess you can get the same results with a long wire and a curtain clip .
for the price , it will really help bring in some stations
rolls up nice and small for travel
helped some distant stations really clear up and i found some neat number station ( yes they can still be found ) with it , hehe
no a good purchase , not a good helper , not even a good antenna
it helps with signal and of course with noise
it was a very expensive shipping
same as antenna .
if you don not want to spend much money for improved reception on a portable sw radio , this is a good choice
i purchased one and it really does help bring in signals that are too weak when using only the telescoping antenna
this is a handy little portble antenna .
this antenna did not work at all
the only good thing i can say is that is was cheap enough that i didn not go to the bother of sending it back , just into the trash .
really like this antenna
just wish it was a bit longer , like a total of <NUM> feet long
have it set up in living room near ceiling and does what it is suppose to do .
this is a good range extender
i am new to the shortwave game , but i must say , this is a good antenna for my yb300pe
i am hearing stations i didn not think i'd be able to get
i am new to the whole shortwave genre , but this is good
it is very easy to use and it does add to your antennas normal range .
for a reasonably priced antenna this is a great product
use with a mulitband radio that gets carried outside frequently
compact size and long antenna make this unit very adaptable
i velcro'd the case to the back of the radio for easy carrying
pull the antenna out as far as necessary to get a signal
i found the antenna wire to be quite long and durable .
this little antenna really makes a huge difference ! it brings in the weak signals so i can hear what is broadcast - while listening i have disconnected and reconnected it to compare reception with using just the stock telescopic antenna and it makes a world of difference ! i use it indoors on my tecsun but i have tried it outside and it does work even better outside
it may not be a super antenna but it really does a great job for improving reception and the price is great too !
i bought this for emergencies and have not tried it out yet
it is for my bug out kit and hope i do not have to use it for that scenario
the shipping was fast and the description was correct
i would recommend to anyone .
this antenna is advertised as something people purchase along with the sony am/fm shortwave world band receiver
and the product description for that radio says there are two antennas included with the radio - a ferrite rod internally , and the little silver telescoping antenna on the top of the radio
nowhere does it say the external antenna comes in the box with the radio ( it does )
so when i purchased that radio , i also purchased this antenna
though i never opened up the packaging and tried out the separately purchased sangean antenna with the sony radio , i have absolutely no doubt about its quality
the antenna that came with the sony receiver appears to be exactly the same antenna - just without the sangean name on it
assuming it is ( and i'd be very surprised if it isn not made in the same factory , even on the same assembly line ) , the antenna works great ! it is compact , long enough to significantly extend the capabilities of the radio , and stores easily out of the way when not in use
just don not buy this with the sony am/fm shortwave world band receiver - that is already got one
i see that this antenna has the same "frequently bought together" buying "suggestion" that the receiver does
amazon took my sangean antenna back without any hassle and credited my credit card quickly with an apology - and a promise to take out the "frequently bought together" suggestion on the product item pages
it is highly misleading , to say the least
so in that regard , i am not impressed with amazon for leaving that still up on both products ( well over a month since purchase now )
got an old receiver that didn not come with this antenna back when you purchased yours ? by all means get it
it is well worth the money .
very nice antenna easy to use and the fact that it was compact made it easy to use and to store
easy to use and put away
i kept the one that came with the radio with the radio
i put this one up permanently at home for quick use .
is exactly what it is described as
a <NUM> ft portable antenna
easily pulls out of the case and and you have a long wire antenna
attach to your radio using the 3
mini plug or clip it on to the radio is external antenna
winds back in with no problem
very good deal for the price .
good alternative for a portable antenna or if you cannot have an outside antenna
works surprisingly well
can give you more noise when used inside , but still better than using the whip alone .
this short wave antenna has increased my reception on my shortwave radio by more than <PERCENT> over just using the radios own antenna
it has increased my reception on all bands including am , fm , tv , and shortwave bands
installing the add on antenna is a breeze
highly recommended .
this antenna comes with the radio
you do not need to order it , unless you lose the antenna included in the box
this improves the reception dramatically on sw
it doesn not improve standard commercial a
reception very much , except at night
the radio comes with this antenna and the carrying case for the radio itself
the antenna itself is outstanding for its size ! very compact , rolls out and in very easily
just use the "shuttle" style knob to reel it back in ! it does improve the received signal considerably compared to the "ship" antenna
it does plug directly into the antenna jack .
this thing is just a hunk of wire
it works just like any other piece of wire
it just is on a spool that lets you wind it back in
nothing magic here .
this antenna is excellent
i placed it on my rooftop and i was able to pull in signals from all over the world
it is worth the price to buy it
by gregg l
friedman md , psychiatrist , hallandale beach , fl
i coundn not believe is was so reasonably priced
i have wanted one of them for a very long time
i used this with my tecsun
indoors it did nothing
outdoors , i hung it from my 2nd story balcony
it brought in over three times as many stations than using the whip antenna
for stations i could get in without it , the signal was cleaner and stronger
it worked better when plugged in than when clipped on ( even though when clipped it still showed an improvement )
it is very easy to reel in when done .
i tried my sangean portable short wave antenna with my sangean 505 , i did not notice any significant improvement with reception , but then again at the time i am living in a rather large city ( mexico city , the biggest in the world )
i took my little radio and antenna on a recent vacation to the us virgin islands and attempted to pick up some radio stations from the french caribbean with the built in whip antenna
i had some luck , but when i connected the i had some improved reception , i was very happy with the result
i recommend this antenna for radio environment .
this is a great antenna that makes a huge difference in reception
just attach it to the in/out plug and watch it work .
this isn not a magic antenna , it is a simple wire that can be plugged into the shortwave ( if it has a jack ) or clipped to the aerial if there is no antenna jack
try a couple of different orientations and you can usually improve the reception of a handheld shortwave significantly
there is a similar kaito antenna that is harder to wind back up , but is otherwise the same
i also have an older antenna that appears to be identical
this antenna is nice and portable , fits in my portable radio carrying case , and gives a decent boost to reception
it is not magic though and you could , in fine diy fashion , hook up <NUM> feet of wire to your shortwave for much the same effect .
due to the predominantly good reviews and great sangean reputation , i expected more from this antenna
it is easy to use , but did not improve reception on any of my radios
i tried using it on a shortwave radio , a weather radio , and a regular am/fm radio
i could not sense a difference in reception either with , or without , use of the antenna
sure , it could have to do with my geographical location or other factors
but after three failed attempts on three different radios , i am sure that the antenna holds some degree of responsibility .
i have two eton ( grundig ) radios
both the s350dl and the mini300 are good radios for me
the addition of this useful little accessory , this random wire , has made both radios even better receivers
in short , sometimes the additional antenna helps with reception , sometimes the effect is negligible , in a few instances it is best to disconnect the antenna
in talking to a friend who is very knowledgeable about all things radio , this is what can be expected of this type of simple , easy to use , equipment
i do use this antenna in conjunction with a grounding wire when using the s350dl , and i find the combination to be very effective
the sensible adapter clip works fine with either radio is antenna
were i to recommend any improvements to this product ( i am doing so here ) , i'd suggest the addition of a sort of device , such as one often finds on tape measures , or fishing spools
the strap is handy , but a hook of some sort off of the spool case would also be a useful feature
of course , one can fashion a hook and employ it with the strap to partially work around this
these are suggestions from an "indoor user" , stringing about windows and curtains where these sort of features would be quite useful , and the kind of user likely to gain in numbers over time
overall , this is a very useful device for better sw listening
i'd recommend this simple antenna to anyone who is looking for a way to easily improve sw reception
it is not a panacea for sw reception issues , but it certainly does help one is reception in a lot of circumstances
the reasonable price and super saver delivery are also positive factors .
i works just fine with my little sony shortwave radio
i like the fact that it retracts making it easily portable
it is definitely not an outside antenna with regard to reception , but it is significantly better than the little factory antenna
i would recommend it to others as a starter antenna for receiving shortwave broadcasts .
i used this antenna in the house this winter and it worked out well on my tecsun <NUM> sw radio
i use another type of antenna i built for summer and outdoors but this antenna could be hung out a window and hung as high as possible
they say position to the north for best reception
have to go to the web and look up sw info
to location and time of year
i really like that it plugs into the radio and has an adapter if needed to clip onto the antenna .
i live in an appartment complex which is brick and i don not get cell phone signals , so i didn not get much from this antenna from my appartment
i will try again outdoors and give another review at a latter date
two stars for now not knowing how this works yet , nice concept if it works outdoors
very portable .
i have several wind up antennas
they all work&<HASHTAG> ;
they are all just a convenient
the added is very handy
for the price , i'd by another one when i need it .
wire is a bit thin but doesn not affect the operation of the devices
the wire antenna that came with my shortwave only had a clip on which was not convenient
this one has 3
5 jack for external antenna and clearly get me better reception across all bands
probably the best overall antenna in a super portable package
recommended .
the signals improved significantly = if there are no blockage from buildings etc and if it is high the signals are excellent .
it is a good little unit
but remember it is only a portable and will just improve reception so much
i do recommend it for its quality and portability .
this antenna will easily improve your inexpensive shortwave is reception
my old sonysony icfsw7600g worldband radio receivershortwave picked up stations that were never possible with the antenna .
i purchased the tecsun to put away in a faraday cage in case of emergency and wanted an external antenna
even though there is really no gain , this antenna allows portability and the ability to have something outside away from inside walls and interference
not bad for the money
this would also be great for a portable antenna to take with you on the go !
the objective of adding the sangean to the was to improve reception relative to the radio is native reception capability
the sangean does not make a substantial difference in this radio is reception
that said , there may be no fault with the sangean antenna and criticism may not be warranted , it may be the telescoping antenna included with the is just that good
the sangean does connect and work as advertised
there is no complaint on quality of build or ease of use .
it coils nicely without hanging up
comes with a coupler to clip onto other radio extending antennas
not a replacement for a antenna
good for what it is : a travel antenna .
this hard drive was received in good shape and has worked in my nas box in a configuration
i have not profiled it for performance , but it is working flawlessly alongside another 1tb seagate in the configuration .
the drive arrived quickly and answered my needs
i have it installed with another 500gb drive and i am happy with the performance
i am especially grateful for the good packing and quick shipping .
i have used both western digital green 1tb and seagate barracuda 7200
11 1tb in dlink <NUM> nas device for about a month
these are my experiences
seagate didn not need firmware update
packaging : wd was packaged very well with cushion padding where as seagate was packed really lousy
i had ordered <NUM> drives in each brand and one of the seagate boxes looked like it was opened already ( may be it was human error while packaging ; i didn not bother )
noise : seagate is noisier than wd but it is much smoother than wd
meaning , wd produced lot of hard clicking sounds that really irritated me ( both drives ; may be just the two i received were defective )
clicking sounds from seagate felt normal to me ( and it was muffled )
heat : seagate got much hotter than wd
i figured wd didn not produce as much as heat because it uses "intelliseek" that runs the motor at optimal/slower speeds rather than the advertised 7200rpm
speed : i couldn not compare speed as i was running wd in raid1 and seagate as standard drives
overall , i am very happy with seagate mainly because of its much smoother operation and brand reputation
hope this review helps !
i was weary about getting this drive since i heard all the problems of loosing data and these drives going bad after a short time
don not believe the hype ! i went ahead and bought it and installed it
i went to the seagate knowledge base site , downloaded the firmware and followed the instructions on the site
i updated the firmware and the drive has been running smooth and fast ! i love the space for the os and all the apps i have loaded
the price is so good too that , i think i am going to buy another one so i can dump all my pics and music on to it separately
or , maybe two so i can run a raid setup
anyways , don not let the firmware problem scare you , this is a very good drive .
this drive failed after <NUM> months use
i am rma'ing it now as it is under warranty but just lost a ton of data
apparently this model has many issues that cause it to fail both hardware design and firmware
definitely not a good combination ! thanks a lot seagate , you just lost all my future business .
i am in the it industry and have had installed , swaped , formated hundreds of hard drives in my life
hard drive failure is normal , and it is expected
what i have found out is that mtbf that manufacturers publish has very little correlation with reality , since reality is affected by factors such as temperature , handling , etc
what they publish is in a perfect laboratory environment-- not what people normally have at home
in my past , i have used seagate , maxtor , western digital , and hitachi
seagate has alway been high on my list because of their reliability and their <NUM> year warranty
personally , reliability is a huge concern for me because i take tons of precious pictures of my family & baby and i cannot afford to lose them
that is why i always build raid systems with different drives from different manufacturers , and in certain cases same manufacturer but with very different batches
after only <NUM> weeks , this drive failed
since it was on a raid system , no big deal
i swapped in another drive , and it to amazon
my other 750g failed after a year is use
that is <NUM> seagate failures within <NUM> days of timespan-- not a good impression so far
let is compare the latest seagate with the latest western digital technologies
my green 1t wd drives have been running for a few months without any problems so far
it is by far the quietest drives i have ever gotten , certainly much quieter than any of the seagate barracuda drives
it is also the most vibration free drives ( seagate is a bit noisier ) and cool running-- heat shortens the lifespan of everything
the return policy for wd is much more hastle free-- you put in your credit card number and they will hold the fees , and mail you a new drive immediately until you return the defective one , upon which they will refund the credit card fees
compare that to seagate is return policy where they want to charge you a set amount of cost if you want them to send you a replacement while you still have the defective drive
seagate used to be well known for its quality in the early 90s
i used to trust them exclusively , but throughout the years their quality has decreased tremendously , and i no longer recommend using them
it happened to maxtor in the early days when megabytes were a lot ( maxtor drives were notoriously bad in the 80s )
i guess every good successful company , in their quest to drive up more and more profits , take shortcuts to make more money and eventually shoot them in the foot
guess what , slashdot has a headline "seagate hard drive fiasco grows
" ha ! i am not surprised
sorry , but seagate is just not living up to its reputations anymore
your <NUM> year warranty is useless when you can not recover precious data such as pictures of your family/baby
regardless of how good a manufacturer is , i cannot emphasize how important it is to building , or at minimum do thorough backups every once in a while
you will be protecting hundreds of for your corporation ( if this is for corporate use ) , and hundreds of tears for your family ( for family use ) .
my st3500320as bricked itself today after <NUM> months
seems like the firmware problem
it would be useful if seagate would proactively notify users about such danerous bugs in the firmware
also , if the drive is an oem drive seagate will not repair it nondestructively , even if the problem is due to the faulty firmware
if you buy a seagate it may be prudent to wait a few months to make sure that model is stable , since so many of their newer drives seems to be having firmeware and related issues .
bought this when it was in the goldbox for a friend
he has <NUM> setup in a raid and it seems to be working great
they just work
seagate has never steered me wrong .
bought two of these for my macpro 8
very easy to install ( open mac case , find empty hard drive slot , push them in , reformat them and they are up and running )
do video work so these have been a great addition .
i have not had it in the machine for very long , only a month so i can not attest to it is long term reliability
so far in use it is a tad faster than the <NUM> gig seagates and wd is that it replaced
before i formatted or used the drive i did check the firmware version and it seems amazon is shipping the latest drives so thats a good thing
so it is a decent speed <NUM> tb drive at a decent price so no complaintsgiving it a <NUM> as some of the previous 1tb drives gave me problems and i am still a bit jaded .
the "seagate st3500320as 500gb 32mb 7200
11 sata hard drive" has performed as expected for me
i bought it to replace a failed iomega drive in an external usb case
the seagate drive was fairly easy to install in the external case and the included software recognized and formatted the drive with no issues
*update*after reading another review , i checked my drive to see if it required a firmware update ( the seagate website has utilities to check ) and it does
the update process is cumbersome
not recommended ! cfh
search the seagate community forum on this one
it will simply disappear from your bios at ramdom intervals and give you the blue screen of death
i fixed all my pc problems by replacing this drive
don not waste your time and money on this one .
perhaps amazon has done some retraining of their warehouse crew since the earlier complaints were posted ? my 1tb oem seagate barracuda was packaged very securely inside of foam padding similar to what is found in the packaging for retail seagate drives
this box was then placed inside of a second box for shipping
it only took <NUM> business days to arrive via usps ! thumbs up to amazon for their care in packaging of this drive for shipment .
the disk arrived ups , i installed , formatted and used it in a windows home server
it came right up and continues to work fine
i somehow missed the fact that it was an oem product , which means no box , just shrink wrap
no cables , just the drive .
i had bought <NUM> of these for my home server and one of the <NUM> failed
amazon was awesome and 'overnighted' me a replacement drive
i sent amazon the request to replace the drive around 4 : 00 p
one day and the new one was in my hands around 10 : 00 a
the next morning
if that is not great service , i dpn not know what is
+ after getting the replacement drive the remaining <NUM> drives work fantastic
thanks , amazon !
i bought this about six months ago when the price was much higher , but i still feel like i got an exceptional deal
this had ncq ( native command queuing ) that most drives do not
that means when files are highly fragmented , the disk drive itself intelligently reads the files according to where they are positioned on the disk and then puts it back together before sending data to the computer
the result is a faster disk than one that doesn not have this feature
i had zero problems with this disk , unlike one of the 1
5 tb drives
i had to send that one back for exchange and got one back that vibrates slightly
so , i plan to purchase another <NUM> tb disk with ncq to complement the one i have
i may make it into a raid configuration .
after purchasing this drive to use in an external case for backing up my computer , i had reoccurring problems with the drive
i tried different cases , different operating systems and even installing the drive in a desktop computer
no luck
after contacting seagate and explaining to them the issues with the drive , they refused to give me a firmware update which seems to be the fix for the problem according to pages and pages of forum reviews
they said since i used it in an external case it voided the warranty
after reviewing the warranty , this is untrue
now i am out of money
i did purchase toshiba drives for my ps3 , laptop and desktop as well as the external case i originally used for this seagate drive
all are working wonderfully
*buyer beware* seagate has really fallen off as far as reliable products go
i would insult their customer service but if you have ever had the torture of using their website and bureaucracy , you already know contacting seagate is like pulling your own teeth in front of a live studio audience .
i'd completely skip the seagate lineup
i had three seagate drives fail ( the next replaced it is predecessor ) in about a year is time
if you are wondering , i work at a university and we are encouraged to buy through purchase orders locally
and that meant seagate
so three drives failed
yes , that counts as a statistical anomaly
it deserves a fine googling
some people tried to tell me my computer case didn not have the proper air flow or that my external casing is power supply hurt the drive
( nuh uh on each account )
other people pointed me out to a firmware problem with a large group of seagate drives
the drives can enter a limbo bsy state that bricks the drive even though physically there is nothing wrong with it
it can be cured with a very technical serial com with the controller board
( which i actually did for kicks
it is kind of cool
) seagate acknowledges the problem
they have a serial number search
armchair quarterbacks estimate the failure is on <PERCENT> of their lineup
not sure
wouldn not take the chance
they won not fix oem drives
they will do the low level repair thing for retail drives if your serial number comes up in their search page
this kind of mass failure of hard disks happened once before oddly enough
it was with hitachi/ibm is deskstar lineup , properly monikered "deathstar
" google it if you'd like
but anyway , for the time being , run away ! run away !
died in less than <NUM> months
i brought this from amazon
now i have contacted seagate for warranty purpose
they said i need to ship the item at my expense and wait for weeks for replacement ( probably another rectified/refurbished brick )
not worthy , total waste of time and money ! another chinese garbage .
i just purchased <NUM> of these drives for use with a voyager q from newer technology as my backup system
my computer is a 2
4 ghz imac and i am running these drives on fw800
regarding performance , these drives are great
as a comparison , i have a 750gb wd mybook fw800 drive that i had been using as my backup drive
i copied a 17gb file from the main computer to both drives ( at different times ) and it took over <NUM> times as long to transfer the files to the old drive ( which is less than 1/2 full ) compared to these drives
stuff : this drive is quiet
also , both of my drives checked out to be unaffected by the drive issue according to the seagate website .
today my computer suddenly stopped working
i am using this seagate 1tb drive as a secondary hdd ( primary drive is much smaller ) and i use it to store my music , movies , etc
thank goodness i also back up everything to a third external drive , because as it turns out the only way to get my computer to start working again was to unplug this internal seagate drive
i checked and ironically i ordered this drive a year ago to the day
so yeah
the drive was fine while it was working , but one year later and it seems to be busted
not planning on buying another seagate any time soon .
this product have been serving my need for over four years with out any problemi have had wd black which is also very reliable but i went with this because it is cheaper
i am sticking with seagate and wd only
i am surprised more people have not posted about what a disaster this product is , with many many early failures
there is a very long and heated thread on seagate forums : [
]mine : installed <NUM> nov 2008 , died <NUM> jan 2009 , with about <NUM> hours of video files i had copied from family camcorder tapes at 1x
too bad to see a company that used to have a fine reputation going down the toilet .
this drive was ordered as a replacement drive after one of these failed in my nas due to power failure ( actually , daughter with a flat iron )
i received it quickly and it installed and was up in seconds
the other drive is still going strong .

great hard disk
very quiet and fast operation
with a sata installation , it is very easy to route cable around the inside of the box .
well , the hd on my <NUM> yr old hp mmpc died and i decided on this model to replace it
installation was a breeze and my system was up and running in no time
so far , the drive is working fine-- fast and quite , and much larger than my old drive
if you do not need the sata cables and controller , go for this one ; it is only the bare drive and therefore , cheaper than buying the kit which includes the cables and controller
nuf said .
this is indeed an oem drive - came with no warranty card , no sata cable , screws , shipping list , manual or any other insert
if this drive goes south i don not have much of a paper trail to help me send it back
purchased from tech for less through amazon
i guess they ran out of them because the seller is now some other outfit .
this was purchased for an office
for some reason i cannot format the drive from windows , i need to use the seagate program i downloaded from seagates site
this doesn not make the drive a bad drive , i just do not feel as comfortable with it as i do others i have purchased that windows will format
the awkward install and setup is the only reason for the lower score .
this unit also is an exact replacement for a second raid sytem i needed
shipped on time and properly packeged
many thanks ! : ) mark
i used this dive for backups and after two backups it completely failed
seagate should be sued forselling total junk to the public i don not know how they get away with selling this junk
the dern thing is almost too quiet
just intalled <NUM> of them raid 1
i can not tell when they are spinning
wow ! if you are installing in an older pc , like me , that doesn not support sata 3
0 , you will need a jumper ( not included ) to change to sata 1
5 .
i purchased three 500gb versions of these back at the beginning of <NUM> for a system build where i used two in a raid configuration and the third drive as a back up
just <NUM> months later all three drives are failing : each has a smart problem ( detected by windows and by seagate seatools ) and two of the three also fail seatools short drive tests
i use these drives in an extremely well ventilated antec p182 case that has a separate hard drive bay that keeps them isolated from the heat produced by the motherboard and graphics card , so heat is not the reason these drives are failing
i believe the real issue is with poor quality components
i use a fair number of other seagate drives and have had no problems with them
i bought literally about a dozen 2
5" 7200rpm drives for upgrading various notebooks ( mac and pc ) without any issues--for a while i was replacing all my friend is drives after i sped my macbook <NUM> drive up from 4200rpm to 7200rpm and was showing everyone the performance improvements
in any case the problems i have had with these drives seem to be an issue limited to this particular version
the only positive thing i can say is that at least i learned these drives were going bad before they completely died
i was able to back up all my data to my nes array
i have filled out rmas through the seagate webpage and will hopefully get replacement drives soon , but i don not know that i will actually trust them considering my <PERCENT> fail rate with the three i already own
i may decide to replace them with wd drives instead .
not much to say
it was good while it lasted
vista began acting weird until it wouldn not boot anymore
luckily i have two more hard drives , a <NUM> gb seagate and a <NUM> gb western digital ( i kept this one from the first computer i ever bought like <NUM> years ago and it still works ! )
i have been reading a lot of negative reviews about seagate hard drives and with my experience i will not buy another seagate drive ever again .
worst drives ever ! had <NUM> fail already none due to excessive heat or impact
the wd drives i purchased at the same time are still going strong
buy what you'd like but i am sticking with wd .
model st3750330as , product number : , firware : sd81 , date code : 08387
worked great for about <NUM> months and then with no warning ( grinding noises , etc
) of imminent failure , i turned my computer off on a thursday night and friday morning the bios would not recognize my hdd
i just got the "no boot device available , press enter key to retry"
i then purchased a copy of "spinrite 6
0" hoping to just recover my data
"spinrite" only recognized the "a" drive that the floppy was in
i even tried an external hdd enclosure with another computer , but that didn not work either
three weeks earlier , i had sold ( after cleaning and formating ) a seagate freeagent pro <NUM> gb external hard drive" because my son had given me a new "wd , my passport essential se" external hard drive
as i am typing this review , i am looking at that "factory sealed" package and just shaking my head
i wish that i had know of the firmware update fromm 7200
11 to 7200
that may have helped
seagate is replacing my hdd under warranty , but years of information , pictures ( less what has been saved to dvd is ) and records are lost
that is my fault for not backing up on a regular basis and i can live with that , but if there was a known problem with these drives , then i feel that seagate should have let all registerd users know of the firmware update , hence my one star rating
there must be a reason that they have cut short their warranty period from five years to three .
it bricked right around the six month mark
my bios won not even recognize that it exists anymore
i have switched sata cables and power plugs and tried it in a completely different machine and it still isn not recognized and so i am reasonably certain that it just plain failed
i am a complete backup fanatic and it is still under warranty so this is nothing more than a slight hassle for me personally , but beware !
mine has finally quit being detected after <NUM> months of use
during that time , it has disappeared several times daily
now it doesn not show up in the bios
i have four of these drives in raid <NUM> using a 3ware
luckily the 3ware card is very smart and i am still able to use my computer
even when it is "working" this raid unit with these drives was slower than it should be
so now i need to buy <NUM> more drives and rebuild my system .
installed this drive to upgrade a 80gb hd on a relatives computer
in less than a week stated to get hard drive failure is imminent messages
ran the seagate diagostic software and the drive did not pass
currently am waiting for a replacement drive from seagate
luckily still had the original 80gb drive that i had cloned from and was able to reinstall it
it is a shame that a brand new drive would not last more than a week
an internet search shows that there has been a high failure rate for this model of hd .
excellent disk drive
easy to install
great amazon price ( $89 ) fast delivery
no problems
remember to buy a molex to sata power cable adapter
needed for older systems with molex power only
converts <NUM> pin molex to sata power ( 15 pin ) .
this drive performs without fail
i have seven of these <NUM> gb hard drives and all have been excellent
i use these formatted with a mac so i can speak only for mac performance .
when you get this drive just go to seagate
com and pop in the serial number and it will tell you if your drive needs the firmware update or not
i received mine and was told by the seagate site i did not need it
so i installed , loaded os , powered down a couple of times to test and everything works fine
pretty fast write speeds as well
btw i have purchased personally and for work seagate , maxtor , western digital and hitachi/ibm drives and all have at one point or another have failed
yes the seagate issue is a special case just like the ibm "deathstars" years ago
but to say one company makes drives that fail more than others is just bullcaca .
update : a newer generation of this drive , the7200
12 , bulk/oem version , has been available for a while now and has better performance in terms of speed and power consumption
so that is likely a better option
original review : as of now , this is the state of the art seagate 1tb drive
it uses just three drive platters ( the thing that looks like a compact disc in the photo - there is actually a stack of those inside your hard drive ! )
older 1tb drives used <NUM> or even <NUM> platters
less platters means greater data density , which means faster data transfer speeds
less platters also means cooler operating temperatures , usually
the 7200
11 line of drives uses 333gb platters
the new 7200
12 drives with 500gb platters is starting to be released - a one platter , 500gb drive is available now
a two platter 1tb drive should be out sometime in the next month or two
by the way , a few notes about oem / bulk drives : - oem or bulk means it comes in plain packaging , with no software , screws or cables
if you are replacing a drive , that may not be a problem
but if it is a new installation , you will need a sata data cable and ( often ) a power adapter
- as of 1/3/2009 , seagate has reduced the warranty on their oem hard drives from <NUM> years to <NUM> years
not a big deal to me , as after <NUM> years i am not going to pay to return the drive and put the 3+- model refurbished drive i get back in my machine anyway
the real issue is , what is the reliability of the drive , so you don not need the warranty ? it is very hard to get a good answer on that
many people would say buy a seagate , western digital , or hitachi drive , and after that , it is a roll of the dice
certainly making sure your fans are working and you clean out the dust bunnies helps !
seagate is knowingly selling a faulty hard drive that just up and decides to not be seen by the computer one day
you will lose everything on it
no it does not stop working , you can hear it spinning and there is no warning to this happening
when you contact them they try to charge you $400 or more to retrieve your data for you .
these hard drives are absolute garbage
i had one for <NUM> year and <NUM> weeks that bricked up
<NUM> weeks past the warranty
i would not be as ticked off if this was not a known issue with these things
just google "barracuda bricked hard drive" or "tick tick tick
significant number of seagate hard drives failing"
the company has a wonderful $300
00 program to get you your data back , great
i just went out and bought a western digital , which i would highly recommend over seagate crap .
i have absolutely no complains for this hd
excellent performance and for a good price
<PERCENT> recommended !
i dunno what the negative reviews are for
small print indicates they are not about the st31000333as , but another drive
i bought my st31000333as over a year ago , use it in an external vantec case with firewire connection
blazing speed , never a problem
note that if you buy the drive alone you don not get rails , disc , anything but the drive itself
if you want a kit with all the cables , etc , then go for that and pay more
i was using western digital hd is for years , finally gave up after the one died
been using the seagate barracuda line exclusively for several years now , 300gb , 400gb , 1tb
no complaints
they run so quiet you don not know they are there
highly recommended .
i have had two of these die on me and have had to backup all of my data and move to new drives
this is unacceptable ! it takes a good day to transfer all of your stuff to a new drive , reload windows , reinstall all software , etc
these drives are crap .
i have owned three of these drives now , and all three have failed in a matter of months
thankfully i have been using them as one disk in a raid , so i haven not lost any data yet , but this failure rate is unacceptable
meanwhile , the western digital drives in my raid have been chugging along for over <NUM> years without issue
do *not* buy these seagate drives unless you want to lose data .
stay away look for updates in other reviews for failures
pros : works fine until it dies ! cons : i have had <NUM> failures of this model disk in the last <NUM> days in <NUM> different systems
these were not gamer systems and are well cooled in large antec boxes
clearly seagate has a problem and expect additional failures - next time i will put the service / shipping charges towards western digital units rather than replacing junk with junk
cons :
died without any warning after two months
the return policy is horrible - you are literally not allowed to use packing peanuts , bubble wrap , or newspaper to package a dead drive when you return it for warranty replacement
it has to be <NUM> inches of foam rubber in a corugated box or your warranty is void
also , you are sent a refurbished drive as a replacement
you are also required to pay for shipping the drive back , and can wait as long as <NUM> days from the day they receive it to get your new one
this last point isn not too bad in itself , but when mixed with everything else , it is stupid
oh , and the rma form on the website was down for two or three days before i could actually get it sent in
customer service couldn not even fill out an rma request for me - the entire system was down for "maintenance"
they also make sure to withhold the detail about packing until you already submitted the form
and possibly gave them $20 to avoid waiting a month for your replacemeother thoughts : what happened , seagate ? i have two more of the older 7200
10 drives in here and they have run absolutely beautifully for the year i have had them - as a matter of fact , they are the only thing holding my degraded raid5 up right now
i still have the old 160gb drive that came with my dell five years back , and it still works like a charm
i order a couple 7200
11 drives , one arrives doa and the other dies within two months without any warning
cons : had a sd15 failure
drive was making a noise just before it failed on machine reboot
was able ( with effort ) to get sd1a flashed onto drive
but then drive became very noisy -- every few seconds , it would sound like the head was tracking accross the drive ( a 'farting' noise , as some have said )
performance would also drop to near zero at these times
got a warranty replacement from seagate ( which cost me $20 ) -- another drive with sd15 ! sure enough , one week after install this one just started to make the noise , so i am typing this before i am computerless once again
other thoughts : i will never , ever buy seagate again
i will do everything i can to make sure no one i know buys their products , either
shame , shame , shame on you , seagate .
all versions of this drive manufactured prior to jan <NUM> may be affected by a serious firmware bug
a firmware update has been released but according to multiple reports the update may brick this drive
i would recommend staying away from this model until the affected drives are out of the supply chain .
i use this in an external hard drive case and have owned it for over a year
it worked fine for me
i partitioned this without any issues
it has not given me any issues till date
i have it hooked to my wdtv and it works flawlessly
the speed on this is blocked to 1
5gbps by a jumper
remove the jumper to bring out it is full potential of 3
would definitely recommend it .
we have purchased dozens of these drives between <NUM> and 2010
over half have died
<NUM> out of 60
one hard drive to stayfar far away
the <NUM> that "died" just bricked out
badfirmware , etc
its amazing how seagate has yet to be suedfor issuing so many dead drives
well , they are paying theprice as their competitors are catching up with them
guaranteed : seagate will not have the title of "bestselling" hard drive maker after 2011
daniel j
tyler ( the wjg )
everything fine
good shipping
nice deal
drive works fine
fairly fast
a good workhorse hard drive
i am very happy with this deal .
easily installed in my generic brand windows home server
plenty of space now for shared files , backups of laptops , etc
i had to buy a sata cable at our local computer recycling store for $2 but it fired right up .
despite the many reviews stating the poor quality of the product i thought i'd give it a go based on the few reviews in its favor
i should have listened
and you should too
the converter is worthless , but if you are wanting to spend a bit more just for the adaptors go for it , but i'd look elsewhere
after merely turning on the electrical device the converted popped , smoked and was no longer effective
or rather , was never affective .
i took this converter to a very long european trip
it worked just fine
my family members were using it for both and appliances
it was very handy to have a single converter for all cases
what can i say - it worked as supposed and didn not break
the set of <NUM> different adapters ( all types used on the planet ) was very handy too .
i am disappointed to report that my unit blew out after a few days of modest use
it was a standard outlet in a uk hotel
but it overheated witin <NUM> minutes and had to be shut down frequently
now i am using a tacima transformer
look into the model as well
this recoton couldn not handle the job , and i was using the setting .
this is a great adapter/converter for international travel
with a trip to several european countries & the uk , this was just what we needed
the only issue i had was w/ the weight
it is rather heavy so we chose to put it on our carry on which we then had to deal w/
i would buy this same one again though
this set , with the case and various different converters is nice for the price
it is well made and practical for travel all over
i usually just look up which one i will need for the country i am visiting and take only that .
this converter has everything you need while traveling abroad
good fit , good function , good price
a real necessity !
i purchased two of the recoton adf <NUM> sets for a recent trip to italy
they worked flawlessly , with both high and devices
we tried them with hair dryers , digital camera battery rechargers , etc
and no problems
they are quite large and heavy , though , and we ditched the carrying case , etc
, and just threw the converter into our suitcases
one important thing to remember is that you only need a voltage converter if the devices you wish to power are incapable of operating at the voltage being provided in the country you are visting
i found that my cell phone charger and my nikon digital camera battery recharger were both designed for both <NUM> and <NUM> volt operation ( read the fine print stamped on the charger ) so all i needed was the "plug adaptor" ( and not a voltage converter ) for these two chargers
the plug adaptors are about $2-$3 each .
my wife needed this for her trip to china
it worked great , till she blew it up by not checking the settings before she plugged a new item into it
the price
1/3rd of what radio shack was going to charge for the same setup
so all in all , we were very pleased with this purchase .
you get what you pay for
i have used it with us electronics in ireland without any problems
i have used dvd players , recharged batteries but not used it for anything heavy duty
seems the same product is sold under many different names .
while it is a bit hefty in its box , i take only the adapters i will need
weight aside , the wife and i have used these adapters in europe , england , scotland ( 6 countries in all ) ; it has worked perfectly for two years and lots of travel
used it for everything from digital cameras to electic shavers and cell phones .
it worked fine for charging camera batteries , etc
when it was used with a hair dryer , it went up in smoke
if you are planning on using it for light duty , it should do just fine , but don not plan on running heavier loads through it .
when i first plugged this into the wall upon arriving in italy , i smelled smoke after about five minutes
i unplugged it , and one side of the casing had started to melt
the next day i mustered the courage to plug it in again , and while it did get hot ( really hot ) it didn not melt any further and i didn not smell any more smoke
on the setting , you can not run more than one laptop or a couple small things without it overheating
don not even try to run anything less than a big hair dryer on the setting
all that said
it did run my laptop , charge the camera batteries , charge the cell phones , etc
for the whole trip .
i bought this for my gf to use with a <NUM> watt hair straightening iron in europe
we made sure the switch was on the low wattage setting and within minutes , it started smelling like burned plastic
but it worked
the second time she used it , not only did the converter burn out , but her $150 hair straightener burned out as well
and we made sure it was on the <NUM> watt setting
by the way , the same wall outlet worked for all of my universal devices ( voltage ) like my ipod , blackberry , and camera chargers with no problem - so the problem was clearly isolated to this converter
it seems to be a manufacturing issue that some people who buy this get good converters while others get faulty ones
but is it worth spending money on this only to have it either not work or even burn out your device ? the only redeeming thing about this is that you get the attachments along with the converter
the outlets in europe are inset in the wall
so even though the converter plugs are the proper shape , it is not long enough to reach the inset outlet
but it is with the attachments .
be very careful on type of devices you plan on using overseas even when plugged into a voltage converter
while theoretically the converter reduces voltage from 230v to 120v , my daughter is hair straightener overheated and melted the adhesive holding the heating elements so the straightener was ruined
my only thought was that 50hz frequency of the power overseas could cause greater current draw for heating devices such as hair dryers , coffee pots , straighteners
the voltage converter cannot modify frequency from <NUM> hz to <NUM> hz
most battery charging devices for laptops , cellphones , camera battery packs operate on 120/240 50/60 hz and will not need the converter but you will need the plug adapter for the wall outlet
look at the rating label on each device to confirm .
i have been using my recoton for over five years to power my braun electric toothbrush in europe
perhaps the only problem with the recoton is the plug
as the converter is so heavy it does not always stay attached to well to the wall/outlet
i use mine in strip that sits on the floor , so i don not have to worry about the converter falling out
if you plan on staying in one place for an extended period of time ( i
not using the converter while traveling ) , i would suggest the franzus <NUM> watt available on amazon
it is heavier and bulkier than the recoton , but it is grounded and accepts us grounded plugs and uses the ( grounded and recessed , holding the converter nicely in the wall ) plug found in much of europe .
this item offered here ( recoton adf1650 50/1600w dual wattage travel converter ) is actually two different converters built into one package
at low setting ( up to 50w ) , it uses a small ac transformer to convert 220v sinusoidal waveform into a 110v sinusoidal waveform
this is the preferred approach which works well for any low power appliance
to handle higher power , however , the ac transformer must be made bulkier and heavier ( around <NUM> pounds just for 1000w )
this makes it impractical as a travel voltage converter for appliance
therefore another method is used by this converter
at high setting ( ) , this convert simply uses a switch inside to chop off part of the 220v sinusoidal waveform
the resulted waveform , as seen by the appliance , is highly distorted and is far from an 110v sinusoidal ac voltage
for a purely resistive appliance ( such as travel iron or water heater ) it works just fine irregardless of different voltage waveform
but if you ever try to power an electronic appliance ( such as tv , computer or battery charger ) with this distorted 220v waveform , it will probably be fried in an instant ! the product manual did warn against using the high setting for any electronic appliance exceeding 50w
so legally the company is covered
my advice is to stay away from this potentially destructive product - unless you are really , really careful about what to plug in
chances are , sooner or later somebody will forget about this warning and plug a xbox into this "converter" - only to get a big boom ! if you must bring electronic appliances with your oversea trips , make sure they are rated for universal voltage of ac
that way , you can safely use them in other countries without the need for a volatge converter
power supplies for most portable electronics ( laptop , camcorder , , electric shavers , etc
) are already designed for universal voltage , although some of them may require you to physically flip a switch
but don not forget , even if you don not need a voltage converter , you still must bring a set of plug adapters for foreign countries
for example , consider thetravel smart polarized adapter plug <NUM> piece setfor this purpose .
i bought this set primarily to be able to recharge my dvd player battery , which has a ac adapter , rather than the 120/240v capability that many chargers for cell phones , cameras , and videocams , as well as hair dryers and razors , now have
if the device ( or its charger ) is 120/240v , you only need a plug adapter to fit the electrical outlet
the voltage converter worked perfectly and allowed me to recharged the dvd battery , via its ac adapter power cord , half a dozen times
i had the wattage switch on "low" ( ) for this use
i would award four and a half stars if i could , because i never used it with a high wattage appliance , and hence cannot attest that it works as well under such conditions
i sometimes travel with a portable hair dryer , but it has a dual voltage switch , so i only use it with a plug adapter
additionally , the dryer is in the neighborhood of <NUM> watts , so i would be reticent to try an appliance at the top of the converter is stated wattage range .
this kit is well made , contains all the plug adapters you will need to travel to <NUM> continents , and unlike some , has switchable wattage to allow the use of both low voltage ( eg
battery rechargers ) and high voltage ( eg
hair dryers ) appliances .
i took this thing to tokyo
it was basically a waste of space
i am not sure if it was the voltage in tokyo or if i just got a busted piece of equipment
it would charge my phone with it but it would only last a few minutes so i just plugged it straight into the wall and it worked even better .
i used this product successfully in the uk to recharge my camera and heat the flat iron for my hair
i would not recommend keeping things plugged in overnight or left unattended to recharge
the main step down units gets very hot .
my wife recently traveled to germany with this unfortunate converter choice
it failed to operate
i caught several of the other reviews on this item that also indicated instant or premature death
think there might be a trend
i can not recommend .
i fought it for someone who lives over seas
she already have one which is her neighbors so she wanted one so i looked up the name and it came up
i read the reviews and bought it right away
it comes with many useful adapters so that it doesn not matter where you go there should be allrite .
this is a product i had before and it is simple to hookup and it works great with no problems
i have had one of these , running it on and off for <NUM> years
i bought it to connect my pentium <NUM> with an riva tnt2 to play the original diablo and duke nukem 3d
now i use it to bridge to my tv
i can not believe they are still available .
perfect for classrooms
small , unobtrusive and works right out of the box
had a room of students working on computers in <NUM> minutes .
they don not mention is clearly enough that this is not a gigabit switch , waste of my money since i missed the <NUM> day return window
it sat in the box for over a month since the project was delayed .
i have purchased many switches and have found the netgear ones such as this <NUM> port to be very dependable
as with all lan switches however , even these are vulnerable to electrical surges so they should be installed behind high quality surge protection .
this is one of three i own
i use this as a remote switch just for the ease of connection and the size of it .
great for lan parties and hasn not failed me yet ! good buy for the price as well especially with how many ports you get .
i ended up mistakenly ordering this , instead of a gigabit switch
mostly my fault , but not what i wanted
oops .
bought this to replace a cisco ( linksys ) switch
it works , but the documentation is scanty
there are <NUM> leds over each port , the function of these two is not differentiated in the manual
printed on the front of the unit is a small note that if an led is on continuously , the port is linked , and blinking indicates activity
so i hook it up , and the left led on port <NUM> and the right led on port <NUM> light continuously
i download files -- no blinking
i read the install manual , which says if the lights do not blink , that indicates a connection problem
patch cords from router are the same that worked fine with my linksys ( and the lights blinked to show activity )
called support ; took <NUM> minutes with an agent who had no tech knowledge and only wanted to "register" me
finally was transferred to 2nd level support
agent could not understand my concern , did not know why there were <NUM> leds per port , and told me don not worry , everything ok , ignore the manual and printing on unit
i will return this unit , and buy a linksys switch .
i have used a number of netgear switches and routers over the years and find the fs108 to be simple , rugged , reliable and fast enough at a low price
i used this switch as the central distribution point for cat6 cable runs in lieu of a more elaborate backboard installation
the switch is in a utility closet and easily accessible if we need to make changes
the switch is as described and was delivered on time .
i am not a super savvy it person , but for home use i can usually handle it
i bought this and a motorola sbg6580 from amazon and both were returned after i was never able to get everything working
it is been long enough that i don not remember specifics , but i remember being able to get a portion working but never all of it
i don not think there was a specific issue with this but it and the cable modem would not play in the same sandbox .
i have a linksys <NUM> wired port/2 wireless connection router and needed to add additional wired computers to my home network
this switch was very inexpensive compared to other choices
installation was easy - i just plugged one connection into my router and connected the remaining computers and it was good to go
i have both internal and internet access and there is no noticeable difference in speed
some reviews have said it runs hot , but i haven not noticed that at all
there is no warm electric smell and the box is cool to the touch
i highly recommend this unit .
netgear provides an excellent , durable , professional network switch
and amazon offers it at an unbeatable low price ! excellent
this router works fine with all of the hardware including a brother laser printer , an apple imac , and a windows desktop machine
this switch will give you your best bang for your buck , guaranteed !
the first switch broke after <NUM> years of use
replaced it with an identical switch
will see how this one lasts
did not notice any issues with performance
does the job .
i purchased this switch <NUM> years agohappy with it , however , the supplied power adaptor seems not to provide enough current , it runs hotit seems to have more current power adaptor to run ( at least 2a , do not use the supplied adaptor ) now i install it vertically on the wall , just warm to touch ( just use <NUM> out of 8 ) for more stable operation , a stronger power supply is recommended ( at least 2a )
this 10/100 megabit switch is great if you are starting to feel the squeeze of a <NUM> megabit network
if you are like me , it getting pretty old moving huge scanned pictures and other large files around the home lan
at <NUM> megabits , it typically took me minutes to get a cdr worth of scanned images over to my cdr writing machine for backup
well , not any more ! since i hooked up my , i can move a cdr worth of images or mp3 files ( 650 megs worth ) in about minutes instead of that
this switch is a piece of art
built like a tank , incredibly solid and small for what it does
no fan , so it makes no noise whatsoever
the switch hooked up painlessly and worked flawlessly from the .
great price use a lot of them
i bought this to wire my entertainment room with ethernet instead of , as my router is signal is spotty at times
i have an imac , apple tv , and bluray player all hooked up ti this switch
there is no buffering when watching any streaming service on any device
highly recommend this for those with weak or spotty signals .
we have ordered more of these since this one and it does a fantastic job
quality product and it served the purpose that we needed it for .
the power connector on my fs108 is very sensitive - try to shift the unit or move the power cord in any way and it goes into a fit , flashing all lights and all connected devices indicate they have lost their network connection
my friend reports the same problems with his
mine is being relegated to the spares drawer as soon as i purchase a replacement - not another netgear
a shame , it is otherwise a nice switch .
i couldn not find an wireless router that i liked , so i reverted to using this switch
it works perfectly and since each port is , you don not have to fiddle with which port is the uplink port
reasonable priced as well
you can spend half as much for chinese knockoffs , but i don not want to take chances like that -- all these packets need to get to the right place error free .
works as advertised
i would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable switch for home use
this is very plug it in and go
there is really not much to it .
good switch for home applications
easy setup
compact size
i'd recommend that anyone buy these
simple way to expand your internal network , especially in new construction .
when it arrived , one of the ports didnt work
i dont know if this is common with netgear products , but this one is not worth the price
will not buy this brand again
going with cisco .
does what it is supposed to do
great deal for the price
i'd buy another one of these , if the need arises .
this switch is now located behind my entertainment center
it handles the xbox , satellite , blueray , desktop computer and a spare wire for a laptop
it does a great job and the price including shipping was better than the local shops .
an incredible product , currently running on a home linux network , works great and stays up and working for long , even for burning through nfs
great product !
i have several of these switches in place and every few months i start seeing huge amounts of latency and dropped packets in my internet connection
after going back and forth with various isps and checking everything else , i realized the problem was in these switches
unplugging the fs108 , waiting a second and plugging it in , the problem instantly disappears
after some periods of time , and possibly under occasional heavy use , these switches begin to not function properly and need to be reset
once they are reset , they work fine
this is an otherwise solid unit except it cannot be left unattended and operate reliably in my experience
unfortunately , that is what these switches should do .
i have been using these for a while and have had great luck
pros : - price- great lifetime warranty- fast gigabit unmanaged switch- solid , heavy case
cons- non so far - i will follow up if i have any problems
seems to me when a unmanaged desktop switch works well , it is just what you want
this is the case here
speaking of case - this unit has a metal case which gives it a little heft
when you have a bunch of cables plugged in it has a better chance of staying in place and i think it is more durable .
the switch allowed me to finish up my network within my home
takes up very little room and extremly easy to hook up .
especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit
high quality for a low price
i will not hesitate to buy it again if i need a <NUM> port switch .
i am using this in my home theater to share an single ethernet connection between a dvr , dvd player , and a streaming video player
it works well for this application
in a dark room the blinking status lights can be annoying
if the status lights could be disabled , i'd give it <NUM> stars ( hint , hint , netgear ) .
fabulous ! worth every penny ! i have my , ruko and apple tv all connected and no loss of quality ! excellent !
really good experience so far , have had it running 24/7 for ~3 months and has worked very well , can not complain .
these are the best there are , sturdy , simple and work every timei use mine to hardwire first floor of the house for blue rays , desktop and hookup location for work laptopthroughput is great and installation was extremely simplethis design did not change for last <NUM> years
this device may look simple , and that is because it is
you just hook it up and volia ! internet to all your devices , just don not forget to get a good router ! when it comes to networking i am not the brightest , but these were easy to figure out how to use and so far they work great
they seem very sturdy and the wall mounts make they easily accessible
we have two , one connected to the pcs and one that we use to connect all our gaming devices .
a perfect good ethernet switch but i didn not see the it is only 10/100 mbps
so it is the bottleneck in my network
i now use it as an extra switch if i need additional temporary connections
it states "every port supports up to <NUM> mbps in dedicated bandwidth" but i could verify this
pros : - very reliable- small footprintcons : - only for 10/100 mbps networks- no indicator light on front ( non cable side since this is not rack mounted ) - rubber feet tend to fall off
this switch works like a charm
zero setup so it was an easy install
i needed multiple network connections at my entertainment center ( hdtv , bd , etc ) and my broadband router is in an upstairs study
wireless just doesn not do it yet for streaming movies , plus i did not want to buy a wireless adapter for each device
this was a great investment .
works perfectly with our office system
great buy and not problems at all ! i highly recommend it , netgear is always a good quality buy .
i had one ethernet internet cable coming in to my home theater but needed to hook up my directtv dvr and samsung blu ray player
worked like a charm
it has more slots than i needed but may hook the wii console to the internet some day
if i figure out why ! good product and with the $10 rebate it was a very cheap solution to my problem .
my old hub died after six years of use , so i bought this to replace it
it was simple to install and it works great .
i needed to be able to connect components in my home theater system and this was perfect for the job
yes , there are a couple of these even cheaper , but sometimes you do get what you pay for
this is a hefty little box for the size and it feels quite solid and well made
while i agree with a couple comments regarding the location of the power plug , it was not a deal killer for me at all
it sits back behind everything and is in no way an eyesore among my tv and game gear
i have it connected to an xbox , my dvr , a sony bluray player and have one port still available if i ever decide to connect my tv
i ran an ethernet cable from the modem/router in my media room into the family room via the attic , and once connected , all components worked immediately with no issues at all
we ended up using the extra port for a few days while we were having problems with our wireless network before the replacement router arrived , and the connections on the notebooks were excellent as well
( wireless module had gone out , ethernet was still working fine obviously ! ) this is an wonderful deal for the price , especially with the rebate
edit : been meaning to mention this for awhile
i liked this particular switch so much that when we needed it , i bought another one of these for a different room , it works just as well
both are still working flawlessly and i highly recommend this item if you are in need of an ethernet switch box !
i purchased one of these to split out the cat5 cabling in my basement ; i only had one cable coming in but needed three
so far it has been working 24/7 for the past <NUM> months with no problems
this switch is super simple
there are no web interfaces and complicated configuration steps to go through
don not need them
just plug it in , plug in your cat5 cables and go
the hardest part of the installation was installing the screws for wall mounting it
the only thing i can complain about is the huge power supply that powers it ; i am pretty sure it outweighs the switch and it is large enough that if you plug it into the top socket of an outlet it will block the bottom one
thankfully , netgear chose to go with prongs that allow it to be inserted upside down in a socket
additionally , they provided about <NUM> feet of wire to give plenty of flexibility in locating the switch and i was able to place it in an inconspicuous spot
if you need expand your home network , this little unit will do it in a snap .
switch works without any issues
--- -- --- --- --- ---- --- --- --- ---- ----- ----- ---- --- ---
i installed one of these on each of the two desks that me and my wife have in our home
now we can plug into the network with a 3' cable and we are off and running
granted a wireless switch is not the most complex of all product purchases , i was more than happy with the setup
unwrap , to your existing network and you are in business .
it worked as soon as i plugged in the switch off the router
each device i plugged into the switch connected right away .
the package arrives neatly packaged and properly secured
the packaging is easy to open and everything needed is included except for an ethernet cable , but you should have <NUM> or <NUM> of these laying around already
installation is super easy , just plug in the power connector and plug in your in and out ethernet connections and you are done
construction is very solid and i can see this box lasting almost forever unless you drop it from a <NUM> story building .
what can i say ? it does what it should - it is netgear ! we have never had any problems with netgear products and for $8 who could pass this up ?
plug it in and it works - why can not they make all computer devices this simple ? no setup , no muss , you have already got about <NUM> of the cables you need from old devices
nothing could be better .
works like a charm , no issues no concerns , no problems
used the in cascades with ~70 machines
tried it for many months now .
a nice looking product in a metal case
i plugged in the cables and the power supply and it worked
end of story
what more could one want in a switch at a good price .
easy to plug in , works exactly as it is supposed to , the price is right
don not forget to have extra cat5 cables around to plug into your router
better yet , pick up some using amazon is &<HASHTAG> ; &<HASHTAG> ; program with the low , low prices and free shipping .
seems to help the speed and visuals appear faster
no problems with it , would purchase again
keep in mind this is a switch , not a modem .
with all the items i have to hook up online , there is just not enough room on a router to hook everything up
this is where this great switch comes in to action
with a jumper wire from the router to the switch , i can then add all my other data line hook ups with out loosing any power or speed
who ever thought of this is a genius ! if you find your self running out of room to hook things up , this is your answer .
installed this switch to serve a printer and desktop pc
it is been rock solid so far
the printer would not hold a reliable wireless connections , so i opted to use its ethernet port .
for me this was very simple to install and set up
basically just plug it in and plug in the ethernet cables and it worked
there was no software that had to be installed and so it was about as simple as it gets for me at least .
i have owned these for roughly a couple of weeks , but i have never had any issues with any other netgear switches that i have bought in the past .
i bought this little switch to run either my bluray player or my logitech review from one ethernet cable which runs from my router
build quality is good and it works great
i would recommend it .
the reason that i purchased the device is because i ran out of ports on my router
i need two devices to share a port on the router at different times of the day
i didn not know if it would works , but it works great
for $19
99 , one can not go wrong
i do a lot of networking with other businesses ( linksys and belkin ) love the linksys and the belkin both
i am very happy with this switch , it workes great without problems ( sofar ) , connects easely and smoothly trouble
i love this switch
it says , connect and use , i just connected all the cables , with in seconds , it was working great with no problems
i recomend this to anyone
if anything goes wrong , i will update
( bought at staples ) ( i am using my moms account )
nice little switch box that works exactly like it should
i unboxed it , mounted it on a wall , plugged it in and it was good to go
better built and half the size of the d link switch it replaced
i really like the fact that it has a metal housing and not cheap plastic
if you need a well built an inexpensive switch i highly recommend this one .
its tough , its reliable , no configuration necessary
well suited for home or industrial use
i have bought many of these over the years for myself and for clients ; i have never had one go bad and the quality has maintained itself over the years
fantastic product .
owned it for over a year , works without flaws
simply plug in your stuff and it works
if you are looking for a ethernet switch , then you have found it .
good buy , good product
works great for exactly what we needed
no problems so far & the reviews were good .
this ethernet switch worked exactly as planned
switches are simple pieces of equipment that should be placed as basically a way to get extra ports on your router
take a cable from one of your numbered ports on the router to the switch , and you now have <NUM> new ports on your router ! make sure when you do your math though you count the two spots ( one on the switch , one on the router ) that you won not have
example : if you are using a linksys router , they have <NUM> numbered slots usually
and this has 5
that does not mean you can get <NUM> devices hardwired
you will get 7 , instead of four
3 computers on the router , one cable on the router goes to the switch , and then four extras on the switch ! good luck !
i bought this switch because i wanted to go from a wireless environment to a environment
the modem/router is in the living room , and my bedroom was completely wireless ( xbox <NUM> and pc )
due to issues with the xbox <NUM> wireless settings , i decided to the xbox 360
after having issues with the services to my pc via wireless , i decided that i too wanted to the pc
my only concern was that i did not want to run <NUM> cat5e cables from the router to the bedroom
i decided to run <NUM> cat5e cable to a switch in the bedroom , and then a cat5e cable to each the xbox <NUM> and the pc
thus far , it is working like a charm .
simple and effective .
netgear products have always been my first choice in home interconnection
i have found netgear products to be reliable and full featured , quite frequently having more of the needed and hand features that their competitors offer
this device was needed to expand the port availability to my curent system to allow addition fo internet linkage for a newly installed solar array system to my house
the divice works well and meets my needs .
this is a good ethernet switch and works as advertised
i needed an efficient and reliable switch inside my network control panel , a panel in a closet where all my telephone , cable tv , alarm system , and ethernet wires interconnect
since the panel was rather crowded already , i needed a compact unit with a hardy case
this unit fits the bill and it is working as designed
this is an industrial looking switch well suited for inside a panel
it would not look so great on a desktop
for that i would recommend the linksys se1500 , a similar unit , seemingly reliable , with a sharper look
i did not have "the loose plug" issue another reviewer experienced
mine fits well - luck of the draw i guess .
works great in my entertainment center
have a lot of devices these days that connect to the internet , and decided to cut down on the wifi in the house
this guy works great with all the devices , no hassle , easy install .
perfect cheap switch when you just want to plug it in and not have to worry about configuring a device
this is not a managed switch but why pay extra unless you absolutely need management capabilities , this is a perfect buy if you are looking for a unmanaged switch to just connect a couple of devices off one ethernet port .
seems rare for any networking device to simply work right out of the box , but this one did
i bought another one i liked it so much .
i purchased this unit for my home network about <NUM> years agoand it is still working great ! network traffic progresses smoothlyeven at <NUM> seperate stations and has a great value for the money .
competent switch
netgear seems to be like cisco is cousin when it comes to at least home routers , where cisco is business/enterprise routers/switches are sworn by , i can say the same for netgear at the home level
very good switch , i have my computer + printer plugged into it ( far away from the router , it is in another room ) perfect throughput , everything is great
printed through it from another computer on the network multiple times .
this worked flawlessly with a powerline adapter then splitting out the connection to a ps3 , logitech revue and
none of the downstream components had any issues receiving or sending data through this device
highly recommended for a cost effective solution outside of using wireless
in my house i have a wired ethernet backbone to heavy users plus wifi
you use an ethernet switch sort of like an outlet strip for power
you plug one ethernet run from your cable or dsl ethernet modem source into the ethernet switch and then can plug up to <NUM> other ethernet runs or devices into the remaining ports on the ethernet switch
it doesn not require and setup - you just plug and go
it lets more devices share your internet connection
this is a small box and feels solidly made due to its metal case
it uses a small external power supply ( provided ) to power the ethernet switch
i has been my experience in the past with netgear products that these tend to be very reliable and long lasting
the only small negative is that it would be nicer still if they put the power supply into the device itself
i am not a fan of the "wall wart" power supply .
fast shipping , great great price
this netgear switch works exactly as described
integrated into my home network with ease
i am using this with several apple items
my signal chain is : -cable modem> apple extreme base station ( wifi ) > netgear switch> 360 , wii , mac mini , apple tv
all of my devices get internet and the speeds seem to have increased across the board
small compact size does not take up a lot of room
happy with the purchase .
i am using this to subdivide a network and it works perfectly
no setup , just plug and play
i really like the netgear brand of products , all i have used have been very good
i plan to replace some linksys router/switches with these the next time they fail .
this switch is basic and it works just fine , it is a great value for the price that i paid .
this is a great buy if you are looking to split your incoming internet into two , or more , devices
i bought this for my father , so he could have his pc connected to the internet at the same time as his roku box
this was extremely easy to set up , even for a <NUM> year old who abhors modern day technology--he did it on his own
i would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality , cheaply priced ethernet switch
if you are looking for an ethernet cable , look at mediabridge is products , as they are of great quality .
great switch for small jobs
i have been using it for years & i haven not had a single problem with it .
netgear has a good reputation and history of making quality products and this is no exception
it is easy to see that they did not sacrifice quality at the cost of making a low price product
it is a simple low end switch , so don not look for features that is not what it was designed for and where the cost savings comes from .
i use these as temporary network expanders in conference rooms or hotels
they work well and the price is good .
just plug it in and it works perfect
your router will assign an ip automatically and your are off and running
no software to install or anything
done .
it works perfectly fine
i got this product cause my wireless router ports were all used up and needed more for my pc , and player , and xbox 360 , and works fine
only problem i have is the power cord doesn not fit in the switch port it keeps slipping out
but i just tied it with some string and its good enough for me as long as it works
xd i am sure if i returned it and got another one it would work alot better
i prob just got a faulty one : (
great price with rebate
installed fine and got my dvr , blu ray and tv all on the internet at once small box that is easily hidden and can be wall mounted though i have not done that .
as with all ethernet switches it should be pretty straight foward to plug in and connected
this is the second one i have used
the first one has been up and running on my work network 24/7 for over <NUM> years with no issues
this one i hooked up on my home network , and worked as expected found connections and i was up and runnning as fast as i could hook up the cables !
i have many of netgear is switches
they have all working been well for a long time
slightly more expensive than some brands but worth it .
this is a nice , compact switch that definitely improved the speed of my local pc network
i read a review where this switch runs hot
i have all five ports in use and its running around 99f degrees
my dsl modem with just two ports in use actually runs hotter ( 101f )
okay , four degrees but you can tell a difference when you touch them
the fs105 switch does not interfere with am radio reception as my old linksys <NUM> port hub especially at the upper am radio band
perhaps it is the metal box of the fs105 that provides better shielding
its nice that netgear gives me the screws and wall anchors for mounting the switch to something either wood or plaster
but is it too much to ask netgear to include a mounting template ( piece of paper ) so i can put those screws exactly where i need them with less fuss than measuring and guessing ? perhaps i should not be disappointed that the fs105 i got is not the same one as pictured on the amazon page
that picture shows an uplink button and the unit is wider
i connected a cable from my dsl modem/router is uplink port to the first port of this switch and it works just fine
if you only need four to five ports , this is a very nice switch
and did you know that according to netgear , the mean time between failure ( mtbf ) is twice that of either the fs108 ( version ) or the fs116 ( version )
it may make more sense to buy two of these switches from a reliability sense .
i have always liked netgear is line of simple desktop hubs and switches
they are small , simple , , and they work , no fuss
this one and ones like it with more ports have been on the market for years , seemingly unchanged -- probably because they work as advertised for a good price
this one is no different
i am happy to see that they have replaced the old linear power supplies with a more modern switching supply
this will waste less power , which is nice on something that will be plugged in basically all the time .
having used ethernet for a number of years , i have accumulated a collection of switches and routers
since they are such simple devices , i was surprised to learn that they do break/burn out
after testing my old devices , i purchased two of these netgear switches to handle the array of ethernet connections now required for the current home entertainment systems
so far , so good .
i have plugged in three computers into this <NUM> port switch and all of them work fine
with the ethernet cards installed in all my systems , i found the installation to be a cakewalk
the configuration is so simple and it just takes a few moments of your time
i just had to plug in the power cable first then connected the ethernet cables of all the comps and it was ready
but it needs an external power supply chord and does not have a power on switch
the metal casing makes this device quite heavy
not that i carry it around all the time but it could have been of lesser weight
the led lights and the ethernet ports are on the same side
this is a major disadvantage for me because the wires flow on my desk
had the ports been at the back i would have had some control in keeping my desk uncluttered
my fs105na also gets warm after continuous usage for more than an hour .
hook up was a breeze , does what it is supposed to
i use the additional connection for my web based garage door openers
cannot comment if there is decay in data transfer .
i have two
chose them over plastic switches and it seems to have been a solid choice
they do what they are supposed to , which in my case is to double the ethernet feed to my two pairs of dish boxes and bluray players .
although this says its five ports , its not really
one port is taken up with your internet link , so you can attach four additional items to this
this switch comes with a power supply so you need a plug near by to use it
it worked right out of the box without needing to install any software
i have a windows <NUM> laptop and a sony bluray player attached to it
i feel i have definitely gotten my money is worth
netgear makes a good quality product .
this switch has been a pleasant surprise
i have a cable that runs from a router in my house to my office which is located in a separate building behind the house
the switch is in my office and performs flawlessly
i have a desktop connected to the switch and am able to transfer large files with ease
i have a phone system connected to it that works better than my landline
i have a wireless access point connected to it for the use of my netbook which is located on the opposite side of my office
this has been a unexpectedly useful investment .
don not know what to say
it does what it claims to do
doesn not toast my grill cheese sandwiches or change my oil but does add ethernet ports
this netgear model has been around for a while
i use a lot of them in my small business
they are very handy to park on conference tables and desks to provide wired internet connections for multiple people
it is a very solidly built model ( all metal ) , with a industrial design and small footprint
installation is a snap -- just plug in the power supply , connect your pcs/peripherals with regular patch cables , and your done
two issues : 1 ) this is not a gigabit switch , just an 10/100 switch
if you are just using it for internet connections , that is probably fine , since you will be limited by your internet speed anyway
but if you are running a gigabit ethernet and want to move gigs over the network quickly , you will need a faster switch ( assuming all the other gear on your network is also gigabit speed )
2 ) i have had a couple of this switches fail over the years , and it is always been the power supply that failed , not the switch
given how cheap these are now , i'd suggest that you buy a spare , just to have the spare power supply on hand , if you can not afford to have a network failure for more than a few minutes
if the power supply fails , you can plug in a new power supply in under a minute , which is easier than replacing a whole switch
i don not want to make it seem like the netgear power supply is unreliable -- i have had two power supplies fail over the past four years
i just wanted to provide a bit of useful "just in case" advice for small businesses .
this was just what i was looking for
it networks my pc is perfectly and can now share printers , etc
without dropping out of the connection
sturdy construction
great price .
i use this small switch to share the single ethernet port on my living room to all tv stand devices
i left it always on for the last <NUM> months and it never gave any problem or had to be reset
highly recommended
with the rebate , it turns to be one of the cheapest small switch available , but still it looks great quality .
needed to add ethernet ports to my home pc installation , but had no spare ports on the linksys router
this netgear box solved that problem quickly and with minimal installation hassle .
well , being a simple switch , there is not much to say about : looks and feels well built , works just fine
does not warm up
very nice product
will buy again
bought this to replace a dynex switch i got at best buy for $32
the dynex was plastic and felt cheap
i love that this netgear switch has a metal body
it feels like better construction overall , and at $12 less , it is a great deal
all the ports work exactly as expected
my only complaint is that the power plug and the rj45 jacks are on opposite sides of the switch
this may not matter to you , but for me it was slightly annoying because the switch sits in an entertainment center just like a dvd player or a set top box
it would be nice if all the cables came out of the same side so everything could be together , but it certainly isn not a deal breaker
i would definitely buy this again .
i buy this product because i trust netgear , when i open the package , it is a solid product , works very well , i like it .
if you want a good solid low cost switch this is it
i have installed dozens of these and they have proved to be quite reliable
the housing is metal , not some cheap plastic and the switch works well .
i like this fs line of netgear is 5- and 10/100 switches because the status lights are on each jack
you don not have to match up a jack number on one side with a light number on the other side
i have had several at work and at home and not one has ever failed on me
it is
and they now come with a small , lightweight , ac adapter instead of the huge , heavy one that netgears had been known for
the $10 rebate process went smoothly , though i received it on a visa card rather than a check
i tucked this switch in my is tv furniture to network his tv , player , and wii .
i love how heavy duty this switch feels
it probably works the same as the rest , but has a nice substantial feel to it
plus i though of going all gigabit , but in a home setting do you really need it ? if you have download speeds of <NUM> mbps thats for the whole house , and is super fast , if you have <NUM> thats phenomenal , but probably more than you need to have <NUM> roku is streaming at once , so save a little cash and this should meet you needs just fine .
bought my first fs105 on 5/28/2012 from amazon
it died several days later
that time , amazon replaced it including return postage on 6/7/2012
ok , i expect a dud once in awhile
however , this morning , 9/23/2012 , less than <NUM> months later , the replacement died
disappointed in the netgear brand
please be aware that in keeping with the instructions , it is not in direct sunlight , not near a heater or heat source , and is in an open area where it gets plenty of ventilation and is climate controlled
it sits flat on a table , nothing on top or under it to heat up
so i can not think of anything that i have done to cause the problem
it was good while it lasted
i didn not overwork it ; i simply wanted to connect my laptop and my desktop to my dsl ethernet connection
the laptop is always connected ; the desktop only occasionally
last night it was working fine , this morning , nada
amazon is solution is for me to pay return postage , and they will issue a "partial" refund in an unnamed amount
i suspect that the partial refund won not even cover the cost of return postage
guess some days it just doesn not pay to get out of bed ! i sent email "feedback" to netgear , since they don not provide any other options on their website
their web forms would not accept a phone call or support , don not know why
i don not have high hopes for any assistance from them
just wanted to let potential buyers aware of my bad experience
lots of folks seem happy with this product , but i wonder how many of them will feel the same after <NUM> months or a year
good luck everyone ! update : 9/28/2012 i emailed netgear about a week ago and explained what happened with their product , asking what recourse i had
i got 7 ( seven ! ) emails back , stating that they had received my email and/or it was "referred" to such and such a department for handling
then i got one expressing sorrow that my claim had been handled badly ( gee , i didn not see that they had handled it at all ! ) and would i fill out a survey so they could improve for their customers ! what about helping this one ! ? the seventh email was a reminder to fill out the survey
give me a break ! guess i just have to laugh
draw your own conclusions .
netgear is dependable , and the money
i use these network switches in many different applications at work , and i have never had a problem with any of them
if you are lucky enough to catch them with a rebate offer , just remember they limit you to two of any single model .
adds more ethernet ports just fine
easy set up and no problems
metal case and well made
i would recommend this product
nicely built desktop switch box
actually mad out of metal instead of plastic
allows needed room to expand any of your ethernet cable components .
it is netgear so it is gotta be good ! just plug it in and go--no need to fool around with some brand x product when you can get the good stuff for so little money .
i needed a simple switch to collect data from three devices and pass across a wireless bridge to my acccess point
the location is out door in a harsh seaside environment
the switch is mounted inside a waterproof box along with its power supply and another poe power supply for another device
my concern was mostly that the switch might overheat in direct sunlight
after two weeks it is performing very well and has experienced several days in
it also works flawlessly over the wifi bridge connection
i am very happy with this switch
if it does ultimately have issues with heat i would not blame in on this device as i am pushing it hard with this particular application .
this solved my problem for needing additional ports
i was going to buy another router with additional ports but while researching the routers i found this switch
you just plug it in and instantly have more ports
much cheaper than buying another router ! so far it has been great and i am sure i will never need more ports than this switch provides .
i purchased two of these switches to extend my home network ; i needed two switches to accommodate upstairs/downstairs locations in home
they provide additional ports on a netgear fvs114 prosafe vpn firewall with <NUM> port switch
i also have two wireless networks connected to the wired network ; one supports video from a surveillence camera
installation was a breeze with nothing to configure ; i one switch and 'installed' the second on the floor next to the outlet jack at my upstairs location
these switches provide many network configuration options and i have used netgear products for years with no problems
i expect the same will be true with these switches .
i have been using some version of this little switch at work and at home for the past several years
they are not fancy , or the fastest switch in the world
but they are solid , handy , small , inexpensive , and they just work
as an it guy , i view it like i view a power strip
always good to have a spare .
i have had this for a few months now and it still works perfect
i'd have no reason to think why it would not continue to function perfectly
it is built nice and solid
it was $19
95 i believe , with a $10 rebate which i received right away
if you need a simple switch for your home office , look no further .
i originally had a hub , and when i realized that i wasn not getting anywhere near the throughput i would get with a switch , the obvious choice was netgear
the switch is fast , slick looking , and has led is to tell you everything about your connections
the downside ? design
the ethernet cables plug into the front of the unit , while the power cord plugs into the back
the problem here is that if your ethernet cables are as flexible as warm butter , they get in the way of the led is or each other
when i plugged three cables in , the box sat to the side because the weight of the cable held up up
if you are going to wall mount the unit ( it comes with screws to do so ) then that might help , but if you are going to set it on your desk , the ethernet cables have to run from the front of it , instead of behind
the unit also gets warm , so make sure you have clearance on all sides so it gets air
otherwise , despite the design issues , the product is slick
has led for 10/100mb , full duplex , collisions , and the 5th port doubles as an uplink
for fast networking netgear makes a quality product .
not too much to say about these units other than they work really well
very affordable and well built - the only switch i buy when i need these for clients .
i purchased this switch to be able to connect two computers to one home run on my wired network , no problems and works reall good .
boy , it is hard to beat this switch for the money
i bought this switch to expand my router port count
i now have an ooma telo ( home phone ) , an at&t ; microcell 3g , and a obi110 ( office phone ) plugged into this netgear switch , and then <NUM> single cable goes from the netgear switch to the 2wire router
no configuring , setup , management , etc
i plug the following directly into my router : my desktop computer , my hp laptop computer with docking station , an actiontec powerline networking module which sends lan over the outlets of my house to my lg 3d tv
so far everything is very stable , and i am pleased because i now have available ports and can do everything i am trying to do from a networking perspective
in short , i highly recommend this switch
it is literally so easy a caveman could do it !
needed some additional ports from an outlet and it solved the issue with no wiring
works great right out of the box .
i bought this to supplement my internet connections for my home theater system
i have my office with modem and router upstairs , and powerline networking for downstairs
lots of people dump on powerline , but i have no problem with it
i used this connection for my ps3 , because i personally hate , especially for gaming
i recently upgraded my tv and theater system to internet connectible equipment
my options were to buy a new powerline adapter for the multiple new connections , use an old router i had laying around as a switch , or buy something like this
i am glad i went this route
the unit is very solid , and heavier than you would expect just looking at it , but that doesn not matter , because you wont be holding it
it really is as trouble free to install as everyone says
i have zero loss of speed in ps3
i can even can still stream vudu in hdx with full strength
this unit is attached to a belkin conserve power strip , and comes on like a charm everytime power is restored
if it helps those with a similar setup , here is what i got : sony bravia 46" tv ethernet connected , sony home theater system ethernet connected , and ps3 ethernet connected to this switch
everything is connected to belkin conserve smart f7c007q av energy saving power strip ( tv master ) with netgear powerline adapter providing the internet connection from my upstairs netgear router
and finally : yes , it is only 10/100 , but find me one thing in your home , starting with your modem and signal from your isp that needs more
if you aren not a business or have a super home network based on 1000 , you really don not need it
this will be fine for <PERCENT> of everyone , and perfect for home theater uses .
this network switch from netgear has a small footprint and is easy to hook and use
i am using this in my home theater to connect several internet capable devices to the single ethernet drop i have in that location and the switch has been working flawlessly for that purpose .
i agree with the other reviewers , in that this is a very solid built and reliable product
i have been using mine for six months now and have not had to touch it
it performs very well , as i have ran multiple file transfers simultaneously among four computers and it was amazingly faster than when using an older 10/100 hub
the one complaint that i have about netgear switches and routers is that many of them have the ports on the front of the unit instead of the back
if you are installing this in some place like your attic or basement , or if you are installing in a computer rack where you want everything facing front , this is a
if you want to put this on your desktop it is a major inconvenience , because the cables coming into the switch will either be strung across the front of your desk , or will snake over and behind the unit
in either case , you have cables on your desktop and it is quite unsightly
all things considered i am still happy with the netgear switch , but if i had it to do over again i would have probably bought one that worked better in my home office .
these have been staple for years
you can not get any better than this
for folks out there that are new to networking , you actually want one of these switches , compared to a hub , because switches will streamline your network and make it run more smoothly
when you use a hub , the ip packets will collide and the qos services of your network card will be doing overtime to get your data to the next target
switches analyse these packets and deliver them out the proper port to the actual destination
i can highly recommend these to anyone building their professional or home network !
i was concerned about my situation as i have one switch box in a bedroom running to my computer and needed to see if i could hook up another behind my tv in the living room
wasn not quite sure if running from one switch box to another would even work or if i would get the speed i needed for hd streaming from amazon and netflix
all i can say it that it works great ! no problems , no issues
one cable from the bedroom to the box behind the tv , and two cables from the box , one to the player and one to the roku box , with hdmi cables to the tv
again , works great ! and the price on this box was a lot cheaper than my local stores
thanks amazon .
i needed this to add a network printer in a different room than my router
i already had a cable run to the other room for my laptop ( wired is faster than its wireless card ) , which runs linux ( ubuntu )
"installation" is probably too complex a word--literally , i just plugged in the power cord , plugged in my cable from my router , and then plugged in my computer and printer--and it just worked
i have a internet connection ( docsis ) , and tested the speed both with without the switch , and it was the same ( /s download , /s up ) .
fantastic ! this device is exactly what it says it is : an ethernet switch
i ran out of ports on my router and needed something simple to expand - this is it
is very fast , no gimmicks or nonsense
plug it in , plug into router and you have four additional ports ready to work flawlessly at lightening speed
i would buy this again !
netgear has made a great switch at a great price point
simply be aware that one of the five ports will be utilized to tie into another switch , the router or the network in general , so only four ports remain useable to expand your network
this is a very handy device where you have a single network connection run to say a bed room or to an entertainment center but then need to add multiple devices to the network , say a network printer , a roku box such asroku <NUM> xs 1080p streaming player , etc
would buy again , though if you need more ports , check outnetgear fs108 prosafe fast ethernet desktop switch .
product works really great as i hooked the cable wire into port <NUM> and <NUM> off the other <NUM> into my samsung tv and my roku and itdoes a really good job
being hardlined to my internet router , it is really fast and i really love it
the instruction manualdid not indicate which port to plug in the internet cable into but after calling the company the best one was port <NUM> althoughyou could plug into any port and also with the cables coming off but i feel <NUM> is the best .
as nice as wifi would be if it worked reliably for everyone , it can be a nightmare for those that are not networking experts
in my experience with wifi devices , i have spent hours working with customer support trying to get them working
i decided one day that i have lost to many hours of my life trying to avoid those cat5 cables , besides a lot of us already have spaghetti wire messes in our house from all our electronic gagets
with this device ( as with others ) you just plug in the cables and the power and the rest takes care of it is self .
it does tend to bottleneck your internet connection so that is a point of concern if you work for a large company
i bought it since our office only has one computer internet outlet in the charting area and i needed to hook up a second computer .
this item worked just fine it came ready to go , it was well packaged with instructions , it did the job i had hoped for , i had a blind spot in my home wifi system so with this i was able to run the cable and provide internet to a part of the house known as the dead zone .
more of a commodity purchase i bought not for a specific purchase , but more to grab and use when needed
netgear makes great products and i have never had problems with any of their switches
be sure to note this is not a 10/100/1000 switch , but it is reflected in the price .
the switch worked initially but a fatal problem developed within hours
on one of the ports , both lights lit continuously even with no plug in the port , and nothing connected to it on any port could communicate through it
there is nothing to configure , fix , or tweak
it doesn not even have an on/off switch-- it either works , or it doesn not
like most netgear products , the unit is built ( on the outside ) like a tank and has the appearance of durability but , of course , what counts is on the inside
after replacing it with another model , i was back in business .
added a second computer to our hdhomerun media center in the den , and this made it easy
it took <NUM> minutes from the time i started hooking up the netgear prosafe until it was complete
both computers were already up and running before i started
one was on a cat5 cable and the other one on a usb wifi stick
now they are both hard wired to the router using this switch .
plugged it in , it worked fine , and it continues to work
if you just need a few more 10/100 mb/s ethernet outlets , this little box will do the job
nice solid metal box .
i have had this on 24/7 for the past month or two and it seems to work ok
it acts as a subnet with <NUM> computers on it
it then hooks into another switch that is configurable but two computers use one port into it .
i have always liked the netgear switches
solid , reliable , and well priced
i needed something at the end of a long run to add another component vs
another cat5e cable back to the main switch
works just fine
appropriately and no issues pegging it at 100mbps throughput .
with switch prices coming down to about $ , it is hard to justify buying anything less than a 10/ for all but the most buyer
as most 10/100 switches have the same capabilities and cost about the same , there is not much to distinguish one from another
still , i particularly like the netgear switch
like other products from netgear , this switch is a little nicer than the competition because it has : - nice sturdy metal construction instead of plastic
the case also has a grounding tab in case you are using the switch in a ( electrically ) environment
- connection status indicators built into the jacks , so you can easily tell which cable is connected and is active
( the &quot ; vistajack&quot ; feature
) - barrel power connector which reduce the likelihood of disconnecting power accidentally
- an switch to toggle port <NUM> between station mode and uplink mode
unlike some hubs where two jacks are wired together , this design prevents accidentally shorting a station to an uplink
- notches on the underside allows for easy attachment to the wall , underside of a counter , etc
with a address buffer and <NUM> packet buffer , this switch can easily handle the typical traffic load of small- and networks
the netgear product is not the cheapest 10/ ( check out the fast ethernet switch , for example ) , but for overall design and , i still like the netgear the most .
what can i say , this little box is plug and play
i was out of ethernet ports so needed a switch , two years ago and it still works great .
bought this <NUM> port ethernet switch after hearing it is iffy on whether it would work
well i am glad to say it definitely does ! didn not even feel any delays on slingbox or netflix movie streaming .
this is a good switch and works quite well
i like the fact that the netgear switches are made of metal and not cheap plastic like almost everything else these days
now regarding the rebates
it is comical
you need to your rebate through a company called prosaferebates and they are clueless on the current rebates going on with the netgear prosafe switches , which means you can not your rebate , and even if you could , you couldn not check the status
if you enter the promo code for the current rebates ( ) you get "0" matches on the prosafe website
i even them and sent them the current rebate form
pdf from amazon and they claim the last rebate expired in january even though this new rebate offer runs from 4/1/12 - 6/30/12
if anyone knows an address where i can just send in the rebate without this nonsense , please let me know .
netgear is line of metal switches and hubs has always been an affordable , dependable product
i am glad to see that they haven not abandoned this format in favor of the plastic so many other companies are using
i bought a couple of these for work when a group decided they needed to cram three conference rooms full of people on short notice
netgear was the only product i trusted to work , and they didn not let me down
at this point , you might want to consider the gs105
even if you don not need the gigabit speed currently , you might in the future .
this switch works great
it is really easy to use
just plug in your devices and thats it ! you don not have to even think about it
it does everything all on its own
this switch is built like a shelter , very tough
it dosen not have a fan but runs pretty cool , even when stacked on top of other networking gear in a enviroment
the only problem i have with is is that there were <NUM> unused ports and the little wire things the touch the cable like kinda sunk down so they couldn not reach the cable so i had to use some tape to get to touch the connectors ( thats why i gave it only <NUM> stars )
other than that it continues to run my network with no problems at all
i am more than <PERCENT> pleased with netgears fs105
i will be receiving a gs108 switch because i need a bigger , gigabit one and i will also be receving a n600 router
will be puting reviews about those products up soon .
solid switch
works with my computer where one of those green switches didn not
i read that the power connector was short and would disconnect
i find no truth to that though i am not yanking on it all the time
also , doesn not feel hot at all which is something else that i have read about this switch ,
i have used literally hundreds of little 5/8 port switches
i prefer the netgear prosafe switches for their solid construction and good power supplies
while they may not necessarily be the cheapest switch out there , they have been solid in every environment i have put them in
enclosed in higher temp cabinets to under a desk they always perform perfectly without a problem .
i got sick and tired of the flaky wireless connection for my ps3 and xbox 360
i don not have a hardwire ethernet connection in the game room so i bought an actiontec powerlink ethernet connection twin pack
( runs ethernet over your home is power lines )
i have a power link module , ps3 , and xbox360 connected to the netgear fs105 switch and everything works perfectly .
heavy , requires external power source , runs a bit hot - but gets the job done .
this stopped my problem with my wireless router kicking my hard wired connection
i had to restart both routers often
now i have a dedicated wire to <NUM> bedrooms , at&t ; and wireless router ! better than i thought , haven not been kicked since i hooked it up
the <NUM> ports consists of <NUM> input and <NUM> output
i am very pleased with this switch and highly recommend it .
i have had this switch for many years , and recently it has been cutting out
i have a desktop pc , ps3 , xbox 360 , and samsung hdtv connected to it now , and often when i turn my computer off then back on , the switch does not work until i unplug it and plug it back in
i realize the device is positively ancient , but this should not happen .
i bought this to direct wire my netflix / player
ran the ethernet from the other side of the house , plugged it in and forgot about it
no issues to date
it lasted only <NUM> months , that is pretty bad for a router/switch
see if i can get a refund for it
my lasted <NUM> yrs .
i misunderstood what it was
i needed a wired router and actually don not know what this is for , although i looked it up
my mistake .
needed to add some more drops at home & this switch was totaly painless
plug it in & your done .
i purchased this switch originally for my home
back when xbox 360 is came without a wireless card ( for shame , microsoft ! ) , i needed a switch to run my tiny home network of a pc , laptop , ps3 , and xbox 360
the switch works as advertised , great for home networks where you receive a residential internet connection &lt ; = <NUM> mb/s
however , if you are going to hook up a couple computers at school or work , you can get more out of a 10/100/1000 switch instead for a slightly higher investment
the major downside to trying to network with a switch directly from your isp is that sometimes it can be complicated to assign ip addresses and dns manually on an xbox <NUM> or ps3
a router will automatically assign ip addresses , but a switch is an "unintelligent" device - it just passes the signal through
make sure that you are getting the right product for your network
if this is it , it won not fail you .
pros : cheap effective switch for most usershandy to have in any network tech is baggood value when it works , which is most of the timeamazon is most excellent return policy : ) cons : does not work with every network device
in my case it worked with every pc and net device in my house except my desktop pc , which it would not link with
netgear is tech support is less useful than breasts on a boar ( how is the weather in india today ? )
i could not get the phone support dude past "the problem must be with your pc" , but my pc works with everything except your switch ! problems like this suggest loose component tolerances that result in timing errors preventing a link between devices
other thoughts : replaced withcisco sf <NUM> port desktop 10/100 switch , which was $2 cheaper , has a metal box the same size , and best of all is a cisco product ! i have used netgear products in the past , and will in the future , but this one was a dud , and if anything goes wrong just rma and skip the phone support .
worked great right out of the box
this is the kind of quality that i expect from netgear
now if they can figure out a way to eleminate the "wall wart" .
the netgear fs105 is a great ethernet switch ( housed in a nice metal case )
you simply plug it in and it works
got it for $15 ( after the $10 rebate )
highly recommended .
this is a great switch
the offer says $10
be ware
this is a $10 prepaid debit card good on the purchase of another netgear unit , no $10 cash .
this product does exactly what i wanted it to do
i plugged in the ethernet cables and it worked great from there
netgear is a great product .
it is a computer ethernet desktop switch that promises what it says it will deliver
the cost seemed very fair also .
what else can i really say ? inexpensive <NUM> port switch , it is exactly what i wanted
now i don not have to deal with wifi dropping in my apartment every once in a while .
needed this to complete the integrated wiring in my house
i simply plugged everything in , and now i have live ethernet jacks in all my bedrooms
great stuff and a perfect little device with no hassle
it is just a switch , so it is not like there is much to go wrong , but you can be confident this one works !
this is advertised as a five port switch
however , one of the ports is used to connect to the modem
as a result , you are left with only four usable ports
i had another product previously that i replaced after three years
it was a five port switch but it had another port to connect the modem so it had five usable ports
this is what i thought i was buying based on the description
the device works fine and is a good product
if you need all five ports , you should get another product .
my internet provider told me i would need a router and if i just used a switch to try to connect both computer and dvd player to the modem my internet would slow to a crawl or not work
i have only the cheapest dsl connection
i thought i would just try this and see what happens
i plugged my dsl modem into the netgear switch and then plugged my new dvd player into the switch and turned everything on
i chose the netflix option on the player and it connected , got my code , entered into the netflix website , and i was instantly streaming my movie
my internet speed has not suffered at all
i would not be using the internet and watching a movie at the same time , but i tried using the internet while the movie was on just to see
no loss of speed
this little switch was the solution i needed .
switches all eventually , especially the cheap ones
this is an older 10/100 model , which is plenty fast for home/ use , and should give you a good 5+ years of use .
i love these particular models
they work great
they are well made
i have owned several netgear products and these are my favorite
if you want a router or a switch that will last , look to these first
they are super affordable to boot !
works just fine for me - no problems at all
good quality metal casing is better than some of the cheaper plastic hubs .
good stable cheap switch
it is a great durable little switch that works perfectly for the home office or small office that doesn not need a lot of ports or a managed switch .
i needed a specific style of &<HASHTAG> ; splitter&<HASHTAG> ; to augment my wired network at work
when i simply used a wifi router to distribute the signal among various computer , i ran into a recognition problem with outlook and my employers network
i discovered that for outlook to work , the network name needed to be specific
adding a router , created a unique set of ip and network credential and while connectivity remained , i was stuck
i tried a &<HASHTAG> ; splitter&<HASHTAG> ; in the most traditional sense ( it was literally was a splitter just like the type used in electric )
but whether it was broken or simply failed to work , i am unsure
the solution is this &<HASHTAG> ; desktop&<HASHTAG> ; ethernet switch ( in this case a <NUM> port ) which ( like it is larger sibs ) simply replicates the port and augments ip distribution
this little unit has mounting screws ( if you wanted to surface mount ) or it can simply sit on the desk
it is powered by an adapter ( to ac ) and doesn not get hot
it is multifunctional in terms of bandwidth and will scale for you
the perfect solution for me as i cabled from the ethernet jack to the switch , then from the switch to my pc & wifi router with additional access ports to spare
this model is available with <NUM> or <NUM> ports
we use a number of these cost effective switches in a variety of applications
great for multiple computers in the same area
great price point too
netgear is always a good buy
very simple not be easier .
rather than buy separate powerline adaptors for devices that are right next to each other , i used this small switch
a+ on the durable metal construction
i expect years of loyal service from this device
i will rate it <NUM> stars once i receive my rebate .
i needed to share an internet connection between a network drive and a computer and this switch did the trick
nothing to install - just plug and go , could not have been easier
and the footprint is nice and small
finally , performance rocks - throughput is very fast .
the less there is to say about a switch the better
thus , i will just say that the build quality is solid , metal not plastic , and i have yet to have a problem .
we recently changed to a fiber optic internet provider and wished to hook both of our computers up to it
this tiny little box does a great job
we used cat5e patch cables to connect the computers to the switch
the set up was simple and quick , and we have had no problems so far .
dead just under <NUM> years after placed in service ( actual usage time about <NUM> months )
powers on now and even provides some limited intermittent function between two computers connected to it but wont talk to the route and will not connect to the net which tells me the port is completely shot and the other ports are about done for
warranty is for all practical intents and purposes pointless as the customer is expected to pay for shipping both ways and in the end you have a refurbished unit that only carries the original purchase date warranty ( i
in my case warranty would end on 7/7/2015 with the <NUM> year warranty this model has ) but shipping cost more than buying a new product
i am dropping my review to <NUM> stars since it did when all is said and done last <NUM> months which comes out to $1
20 a month at the price i paid and $1 a month at the current price
final verdict , i will consider getting another one to replace this but only if i can not find one with a better warranty plan for about the same price
see original review below
there isn not really much to say about a switch , it has one simple job and as long as it does it that is what counts ( a switch for those who are not certain is easiest to explain by saying it is akin to a power strip , you can plug all the machines you want into to it , but if you don not plug it into a managed source of signal such as a router or server it is like expecting a surge strip to provide power and work when it is not plugged into an ac outlet )
if you want to split one lan drop ( network plug in ) at for example at your entertainment center and hook up your ps3 , cable/satellite box , internet ready tv , a/v receiver with internet radio , etc
this is for you because all a switch does is take the one ip address assigned to it by the host system and share it out over all devices connected to it ( while they are turned on and seeking connection of course , it doesn not allot bandwidth to devices that are not currently asking for any )
bottom line is this does the job so far and is well constructed , at this very moment unit has been plugged in for almost two weeks and is cool to the touch ( i have it wall mounted behind my tv were it gets plenty of airflow ) so time will tell but i have seen units like this in multiple brands at customer sites ( i am a network tech ) work for years , if this one fails in an abnormally short time i will revise my review to reflect the time and details/circumstances of the failure .
i am not hiding that i like netgear products for entry level use
this device has a 5th port that you can use in uplink or normal mode
it is very compact with indicator lights for connection and collisions
it is also very reliable .
nice small switch , works immediately after plugging
plugged it to a dlink router to split internet connection and feed all my pcs ; works great .
if you need extra ports for you network these work great and are ruggedly built
the metal case should take a beating and aid in cooling .
this is by far the simplest , fastest , easiest installation of network equipment i have ever done
even the box was easier to open than most ( open top instead of like all the crap i usually end up with )
this switch is nice and heavy - has a very solid , rugged feel
don not know if it will hold up for years , but it looks like it could be around longer than me
no cheap plastic here
took it out of the box , plugged it in , and hooked it up & i was golden &lt ; 1min total setup time , and no problems
likes : -price ( i got it for $9 after rebate ) - ( very small - they did a good job being )
dislikes : didn not come with a pony
works perfectly
i wish it were faster , but for the money , i couldn not ask for more
i has never failed me .
so far , i am impressed with this switch
the small footprint and the ease of installation is really something to behold
it has been reliable as well , as a small , unmanaged switch should be
i debated on whether to get a gigabit switch or a fast ethernet ( 100mbps ) switch
i decided to be cheap and went for this little switch
i also have an old 10mbit ethernet switch by netgear ; that only had four sockets , and one had to be designated for uplink
that little switch was the part of a reason for taking the netgear , though ; it was small , and it was reliable
in that regard , the switch did not disappoint
what did disappoint me was , though , the fact that file transfers between two peer computers ( i
not to the internet ) took longer than expected
the peak transfer rate could not go beyond 10mb/s ; that is expected , and totally fine for my dsl ( and for streaming from one computer to another , to an extent ) but i found it to be sluggish , as the transfer rate i had from an external usb to hard drive could go for 30mb/s or higher
i gave full marks due to the fact that it was a great switch for its class
the problem is , though , that the class itself is showing signs of age
for those of you who would like to set up a home server , i recommend you make a jump to the realm of gigabit ethernet .
desired a small switch to share a single ethernet connection to multiple items in my entertainment center ( tv , bluray , sat tv box etc )
this is a nice compact switch that easily mounted on the back of the cabinet and allowed the single internet cat5 cable running in the wall to my router , to be shared on multiple devices
plugged in power , line to network and then to devices all was needed .
it works i was able to hook up my xbox and pc to this and worked but the speed was a major diffrence i have fiber optics and i constantly test my connection speed when i run without this switch i get 50down <NUM> upload but when i have the switch on i get down and 25upload it just lowers my down speed horribly which is very disappointing if i cant find a way to fix it ima give up on netgear products i always have issues
this switch is still working after more than a year ; and is mounted in a hot/humid hallway with 90f temperatures all summer
i paid $19
99 including shipping and used a $10 rebate
worth it : )
so far this appears to be holding up and working good
it is made in china and the first type i bought that was made in china crapped out after a month
so far this one is working .
we purchased this for an office upgrade that installed an ethernet drop in the wall
after the drop was installed , we exit the drop directly into the netgear fs105 switch
the fs105 gives us other ports , which we use for other devices
it&<HASHTAG> ; s fast and reliable
the netgear fs105 is a mainstay in the corporate world
i work for a defense contractor and we have a number of these floating around the software integration and engineering r&d ; departments
they&<HASHTAG> ; re inexpensive , easy to set up , and simple to use
their footprint is very small and they can be easily mounted to a wall or situated on a desk or table without taking up much space
the switch comes with a dc adapter that plugs in the wall
i have mine mounted on the wall above the ethernet drop
each port contains led indicators that provide visual status for what is connected
the case is all metal and very sturdy
the switch contains no fans , so it is virtually silent
overall , this is a great switch for the price
highly recommended ! be sure to review the technical specifications for this switch to ensure it is adequate for your installation .
i have had this for almost a year now and it is still going strong
there is not much to say about it : plug in your cables and go
doesn not require a whole lot of set up
it is also and feels like solid make
very happy with this purchase .
this device does exactly what it is supposed to
i have a few of them around the office and they have held up to a few years of use already .
this is a splitter so that you can have multiple ethernet ports plugged in and don not need a router
this works wonderfully , even if you have a router and still need more ports
this is a compact device as well and the only mildly inconvenience is that it needs to be plugged in to a power outlet .
needed extra ethernet ports and this did just what i wanted
plugged everything in , connected it to my router and everything worked fine .
to this very day , nancy has never let me down and for that she received the glorious fiver
if you don not own her already , do it
she is like no woman on earth .
this is very easy to use just plug in the things you need and plug in the power and away it goes
no problems over the more than two years it has been used .
works as advertised , plug and play
i will say it survived the drop test , accidentally dropped it about <NUM> feet onto concrete floor and works fine
why get a half duplex hub when you can have the full duplex switch ? after rebate this was $[
] , can not beat that .
this economical little box replaced another which didn not work well
i won not name the other brand , but this is clearly superior in quality , performance , and sturdiness
i attached this to a wall in the closet which has become devoted to internet communications within my home
netgear will be my first brand choice for the next network replacement .
well i had to many items under my tv , and although they are all wireless , road runner kept giving me an excuse about how many wireless devices i had was my problem and i needed to upgrade to lightening 90
i think they tell everyone that to get more money
well i did upgrade and still had the same problem
being a retired network engineer , i knew that if a wireless device is sitting idle or not turned on it is not taking bandwidth
well i ran a cat <NUM> to the tv and hooked the hub up
so now the kids can use everything without any problems
i bough two of these
works well and is an easy way of multiplying access into your network to avoid having to wiring of home runs to the switch .
typical netgear
high quality , easy setup , competitively priced
i have been using netgear products for 8+ years & will continue to do so .
with the purchase of a new internet ready , 3d tv , we needed to extend our network to our rec room
while our wireless can reach there , we wanted the solid performance and security of a hardwired connection to both the tv and the player
our house is already wired for network so it was as easy as patching from the router to one of these switches in the rec room and then plug the tv and in
now we are streaming movies , music and content with no hiccups and a painless installation ! top it off with us purchasing it at a low price along with a $10 rebate and this couldn not be beat .
you need one router on a home network
the modem plugs into it
the router provides dhcp to assign nat addresses
a switch has two uses :
if you need more jacks than your router provides
if you have a long ethernet cable to another room where you need more than oneconnection
in an office that has one jack and you need more than one .
came on time and works as expected
nice product , good service
device has some decent weight to it so that it wont move around easily when stationed .
10/100 ethernet switching how can you go wrong ? until the recent demise of the networking industry , i worked for bay networks/nortel networks and remember raving about 10/100 switches when they dropped to the unheard of price ! wow
an ethernet switch in my home office .
worked for a few days then died
i think the power supply was the weak link
should be a highly reliable product - i am surprised .
nice price , fast shipping and works just like it is supposed to , used to connect multiple pc is in a conference room .
plug and play
to install and plays well with other network equipment
liked it so much i bought it is bigger brother too .
netgear has always produced excellent and reliable products
this little switch is no exception
a high quality heavy duty metal case - unlike most of the competition is plastic cases .
this is awesome , especially for the cost
just plug and play
i have <NUM> port modem/switch from verizon for my internet and needed more lines hooked up in my house then just the 5
so took this , plugged into the modem/switch and bang , <NUM> more ports , nothing else to do
if you need to expand your wired device this is a great addition
just plug it in and your all set to go .
this item does exactly what it is meant to do and it is very easy to work with , even for people like me who do not know much about computers
got this little switch to go in my living room so i could connect my av receiver , ps3 , and directv dvr
setup is a no brainer and the quality of this little unit is superb !
i have been using netgear products for years , both for business and home
i have never been disapointed in any of their products
i purchased this switch to replace a older/cheaper one that worked about half the time
using for smart tv and computer internet in residential garage ( man cave ) .
it works
i keep a couple in stock when my customers routers use up their router ports
it looks solid and so far performs the same way .
easy set up , just connect power cord , plug all ethernet cable that you need for maxium <NUM> port , wait until all green light turn on , you are done , especially work for slingbox without firewall blocking
junk , only one ethernet port worked
tech support sucked
will stay away from net gear
purchased a china model for 10
00 cheaper and it works great .
this switch allowed me to hard wire in my entertainment center with only one data jack available
i can know plug in my surround sound , blu ray , cable box , apple tv and tv
the all now have a hard line , faster downloads .
the switch has worked flawlessly since day one
the metal case is a nice touch as it is being used in a classroom environment -- the sturdier the better for me .
ridiculously easy to set up
lightweight , but with sturdy construction
i like having the lights and inputs on the same side
rebate offer made this a very sweet deal , indeed !
its a box of magic and it works , real simple to hook up ! no brainier for about anyone
great price
i had an older version of this that is at least <NUM> years old
i have an xbox 360 , xbox 1 , and ps3 all in one room with one outlet
this did the trick
install was straight forward .
i had one ethernet port and two devices
what to do
oh i got it , get a switch
why choose this switch you ask
cause i had another one for a similar dilemma and it works
that one has worked for years keeping my xbox and bluray happy
now i expect the same from this one for my pc and voip
way to go layer two device !
i recently replaced my cable provider with at&t ; is uverse , a combination of internet , cable tv , and telephone
my pcs and other devices were hooked together with a linksys network , but the installer told me that the linksys devices wouldn not work properly with his equipment , and everything had to hook directly into the at&t ; box
after pulling lots of cable , he hooked up <NUM> devices , and that was it
everything else had to be wireless , or i was told to get a netgear switch
after some internet research i found i could probably get the linksys to work , but the netgear was reasonably priced and should be
sure enough , the install took all of <NUM> minutes , including swapping cables from the at&t ; box to the netgear box
everything worked perfectly , no problems encountered or adjustments needed
if you have uverse , and need more ports for your devices , this is just what you are looking for
if only all networking problems were this easily solved !
much better build quality than linksys
for switch to hide behind your equipment i would recommend
the ability to mount this on a wall is a plus for cluttered equipment situations
ok i am back ! its now <NUM> years later and
still going strong i will have to change this to <NUM> stars , cisco switches are good for one year
i would suggest picking up the gigabit version with <NUM> ports , leave room to grow this piece of equipment will out last most items you will be plugging into it : ) .
this has been a great switch
got a good deal on this one when the newer model came out .
this thing works like a champ
the metal construction is far superior to all the plastic competition , imo
i recommend this exact model to all that ask me .
nice competitive price
no problem at all installing or using it
it does exactly what it claims
also , it is very compact , sizewise .
i purchased this switch to expand my network
i have owned one of these netgear <NUM> port switches for a few years and have never had a problem , so , this purchase was a no brainer
this one has been in service for a week with no issues .
i would buy it again , does the job and is a good value for the quality you get
wish i had bought it sooner .
i will summarize the performance in one word : delightful
if you need gigabit speeds , search for a different product
personally , i am using these netgear switches with asoka pluglink 9650s and i couldn not be much happier
a couple of these switches and a homeplug system is sweet ! now , i will just have to wait for homeplug av2 equipment with gigabit speeds so i can buy newer , faster switches
; )
i have probably used 20
they rarely fail ( in my experience )
i really like the sturdy metal case and the auto detection .
i got this as a switch for the other end of the house and the kids' video games and computers that weren not yet wireless
it worked like a champ
i was a former linksys user , but have jumped ship and now use netgear because of their reliability and support .
what a great product ! i plugged a ps3 , xbox360 , two computers , and our dsl cable ( all ethernet cables ) into this switch and now all four systems have internet connection
it was that simple ! my only regret is that i got didn not get the switch
i didn not realize that the dsl connection goes in one of these front <NUM> ports
i thought perhaps there was a port in the back ( similar to a usb hub )
i was hoping to have one port available to plug a laptop in , but the four systems and dsl connection uses all five available ports .
the units i received cannot be used in a reliable installation
i received my fs105 v2 this week ( in september 2010 ) , and as another reviewer from this month noted , the power connection is flaky
the power cord disconnects , and the unit powers off , whenever i move either the unit or the cord
i returned my first one for a replacement , and the second unit has the same problem , so it is going back for a refund
the serial numbers from my defective units are 1d52073b01659 and 1d52073g02579
thank you amazon for your excellent return/replacement procedure .
great router got it in just a couple of days no going to best buy to get ripped off anymore
i trust netgear products
i had several netgear products and everything works great
no complain at all
more devices i was able to connect with this switch and still get excellent connection from my router .
i am not technical but this was easy to use , just plugged in lan cable from router and into pc , dvd player and tv
speed is good .
if you have much of a network in your home or office like me ( 14+ devices ) you probably need an extra switch here or there
i have one in my closet , one behind the television
and one behind the wall in the back room
i also carry one around in my computer bag just in case
netgear makes good hardware
i would buy again in a heartbeat if i needed another .
i needed to add another computer to our lan network at home
i ordered this and it came as notified
getting it setup was easy and no problems
i have had no problem with this switch and very happy with the performance
i now have four computers on the lan and this switch keeps on going .
easy to setup and runs great
got this to expand ethernet connection to my wireless router
hook up and plug in , runs flawlessly
no software to install and no setting to choose
only one thing potential buyers needs to be aware : there are only <NUM> ports available for downstream connection
you need use one to connect to your router , modem , or whatever gives you internet access .
this network switch works fine
what more can you say ? some of the reasons i selected this unit include the metal housing ( which makes the unit a little heavier and less likely to slip around ) and the of the status leds with the jacks
be sure to check the dates on other reviews as some of them are just plain wrong
for example , this most recent version/model does not have an "uplink" selector switch
the ports configure automatically if you need to uplink to another switch or router
also , the power connector is not a connector on this unit
one last note
this unit uses a 7
5 vdc power supply , so it will not work with all those older <NUM> vdc netgear power supplies you have lying around .
i bought this keyboard a couple of weeks ago and i have no regrets
the hot keys are great for internet surfing and for listening to media files such as winamp
i also plugged my intellimouse optical into the usb ports in the back and did not have to use a valuable usb port in the back of my machine
i would suggest this keyboard to anyone who likes the ergonomic feel and who spends a lot of time on the internet and listening to or watching media .
this board is great
hotkeys , ergo , etc
i can not wait until you can buy different colored keys for each letter
do use windows without it !
this is the best keyboard on the market
i love the &quot ; blue buttons&quot ; i realy only use the volume play/pause , prev track , next track , this is awsome with winamp
another great thing are the usb ports on the back ( the keyboard is a usb hub ) , that is where i have my mouse connected
the only thing that i would change on the keyboard is that the keys should press a bit less like the ibm keyboard or keyboards on some laptops
another shortcomming is that it is very thick , and it will not fit in the keyboard drawer built into my desk when the legs are put up .
originally i had rated this keyboard very well , but after using it for <NUM> months , i am gonna have to downgrade it to a hold
its nice , but a minor mishap with soda totally ruined the feel
i took it apart , washed it throughly , and now the keys have a very stiff feel , and the space bar likes to miss half my strokes
i have done the same thing to my older ms keyboards , and they all took the treatment pretty well
and the thing is pretty heavy .
i have used an ergo keyboard for a couple years , and have no idea how i ever survived with out one
it goes without saying that ergos are much better than flat keyboards
your shoulders feel so much better
but when my natural elite finally died ( piece of crap that it was , i'd grown attached ) , i was excited to try the pro
let me tell you , after only one day of use , i am already wondering how i ever worked without these hotkeys ! the media keys are especially great--i had grown so sick of having to hunt around with my mouse to mute my music when the phone rang , and this keyboard is &quot ; mute&quot ; button has proved to be my new best friend
several of the buttons are customizable , so i was able to remove several frequently used shortcuts on my desktop , now able to access my calculator and my documents from my keyboard
i am having a little trouble adapting to the placement of the &quot ; insert&quot ; key--it is where &quot ; home&quot ; was on my elite , and you'd think microsoft would have a little consistency with those function keys
a perk for less advanced users , frequently used control shortcuts ( like , , , etc ) are actually marked on the fonts of the letter keys
i have been amazed by how many people still mess with their mouse to do a , so hopefully this will introduce more users to the , , quick keyboard method of cutting n pasting
i agree with other reviewers that the usb ports are not really all that exciting , but i do have both my mouse and digital camera plugged into the ports
works great
this keyboard definitely doesn not give you that : click : that many of us are used to
but i am actually enjoying the muted : clack : instead
so , watch out for those hotkeys--you will get hooked too !
i have had this keyboard for about <NUM> year now ( i think )
it is only negative is how it works with existing computer furniture that i have
with the curved edge and higher profile ( 2 inches high ) this keyboard may be a bit big for some computer desks
it effectively takes up about <NUM> inches in depth and /2 inches in width
my desk has the keyboard "drawer" that pulls out and only has <NUM> inches between the drawer top and the desk bottom
it had a strip of wood on the front face as a hand rest , that i had to remove in order to use this keyboard
this keyboard has a hand rest of its own
i am only mentioning this because it is a common design on some computer desks and may not be as easily removable as mine was
it needed to be removed because it set the keyboard too far back and the drawer was not opening far enough for the top keys to be accessed
also , since my keyboard drawer is only <NUM> inches wide , i only had <NUM> inches left for my mouse pad
what i find is that the keyboard occassionally jostles my /4 inch wide mousepad and it jams against the side of the drawer making it hard to move
my set up works okay for me , however , if your keyboard drawer is any smaller and you need a larger area for a mouse , you might have a problem with this keyboard
the main advantages of this keyboard in my opinion is the sloped design that ergonomically suits the hands better and the usb ports
as a person that has a digital camera , i find these usb ports very handy
who wants to fish behind your cpu every time , you want to download pictures
this keyboard also has keys at the top of it , that do some functions automatically , such as mail , calculator and my computer which are far to the right over the number keys
additionally , you can do all internet functions from back , to home via keys on this keyboard ( top left over keyboard )
i don not find the internet keys so handy as i tend to use the mouse for this
( habit from my work keyboard )
you also can bring up and control your media player via keys too ( top right over keyboard )
this is handy
you can adjust volume , play , stop or change to previous and next track
this is neat , as you don not have to hunt around for this , while in the middle of something else
also , handy are the indicator lights that show that the num lock , caps lock and scroll lock is on
they are right in the middle of the keyboard where you can not miss them
for someone that goofs with caps lock on passwords , this helps somewhat
ironically , due to my work keyboard though i find myself always looking in the wrong spot
as for installing this keyboard it was simple
one thing i did find was that on my older <NUM> dell machine , with windows 98 , i could not get the usb ports to work
i have no idea whether this was a factor of the computer or the keyboard
however , now i have a <NUM> windows me and they work fine
i have no idea why this happened
i regularly have a usb cd writer attached to one and a digital camera to the other
this is a decent deal too
i bought this keyboard for almost twice as much and find it an excellent investment
update : i just realized i did this review <NUM> years ago almost <NUM> and i am typing this update on this very keyboard
sounds like it was a good investment after all .
i purchased the original ms natural keyboard when they first arrived on the market and my wrists instantly fell in love with it
the new and improved keyboard has better key action than the original , the space bar has been enlarged for those of us that type like normal users and not like professional developers
my reason for purchasing the natural keyboard pro over the ms natural keyboard elite was mainly due to the fact that the arrow keys are normally sized
with the natural keyboard elite , the arrow keys are scrunched into this diamond shape near the keypad
when i went to use them , i would continuously hit all of them at once causing all sorts of chaos and verbal malediction to be uttered by yours truly
the hot keys are a nice feature , but i rarely use them , except for the sleep and calculator keys
the software included does allow you to customize the mail , my computer and calculator keys so you can reassign them to launch any app , batch file or
pif that you want
the software also allows you to turn off the windows keys on either the left or right side and most importantly it allows you to turn off the application key ( which can be annoying if you are trying to play games , etc
) to sum , it is a great keyboard , easy to install , setup and customize
if you have an original ms natural keyboard , you will love this one
if you have got big hands , buy this one and skip the natural elite .
the keyboard is adequate
i like the feel of it and the positioning of the hands
however , i have one rather large complaint to make : when typing certain words , namely those that end in &quot ; nce , &quot ; the letter u mysteriously appears at the end of it
i have tested my theory with numerous words , and they all seem to end with a u , even though it wasn not typed
this appears to happen when i am typing at a fast pace
i am going to see if this is just a defect and see if i can get another one
otherwise , just a mixed positive/negative review .
i went from a microsoft natural keyboard elite to a pro , and it is a magnitude better
the elite was mushy , the keys just didn not have any bounce
the pro has more spring
it doesn not have as much response as an ibm model m keyboard , but this is so much better than the elite that it is general feel is great
i hope microsoft brings a keyboard like this one back into full production soon .
this is a great keyboard , and my hands have felt better since the day i got it
however , i excpected it to be a usb keyboard , which it is not , and i thought the usb ports could support all devices , which it can not
the primary reason i own a keyboard is for typing , so i think that should be the focus
this is a great keyboard to type on , and i recomend it for that purpose
i also find the hotkeys extremely well placed , and choosen
they are very usefull
the usb functionality is only ( hence the four stars )
i couldn not make all my devices work well on it , nor is it a usb keyboard ( it still needs the ps/2 port )
neither of these things were huge downfalls for me , but the were annoying , as it was not what i was excpecting
i do highly recommend this for typing , but if you absolutely need usb functionality , buy a usb hub .
as i write this review from work i wish i were using microsoft is natural keyboard pro
i bought two last year and gave one to my aunt ; if it were possible to fall in love with a keyboard , then this thing would steal my heart
the natural keyboard pro is the true successor to the original natural keyboard ; forget about the keyboard elite
this board sports <NUM> multimedia &quot ; hot keys&quot ; that launch browsers , refresh web pages , and much more
there are connectors for usb and ps/2 ports ; microsoft recommends plugging the keyboard into both ports although you can use whatever port you want
key response is good without feeling mushy and the wrist rest is good for those users who like to relax theirs wrists at the bottom of the keyboard
the intellitype software that ships with the keyboard is version 1
0 ; users of america online will want to download the patch for compatibility with aol is 5
0 software
i like microsoft is latest keyboard
it is a good , sturdy keyboard with cool features that are really useful
users with small hands might need some time to get used to the board is rather large layout ; even still the natural keyboard pro is proof that if microsoft quit the software business tomorrow they'd have a great future in hardware .
i have to give credit where credit is due and this keyboard is the best of the best in my opinion
getting used to the split shape of this keyboard and any ergonomic keyboard for that matter takes a little getting used to but it is not difficult and eventually you won not notice the difference
in fact , i find it easy to go back and forth between my keyboard and standard keyboards elsewhere
microsoft keyboards also have a nice solid feel with each keypress
not soft and spongy and not a hard up/down click either , but a nice touch
my last natural ( purchased when they first started making them ) was very reliable and only died once i spilled a large quantity of soda on it
i was then presented with the opportunity to test the rumor of being able to clean your keyboard in the dishwasher ( it doesn not help
) the buttons on the top are helpful and i didn not find any problems with system crashes
most of the buttons are media player related ( play/stop , ffwd , prev , next , volume
) and the others are internet related ( back , fwd , stop , refresh
) personally , the only button i really use is the calculator
other than reliability and feel , i think the main reason to buy this over cheaper keyboards is for the extra usb ports
newer computer manufacturers have wised up to the fact that usb ports might be better placed on the front of the case rather than the back
if you are not one of these lucky souls with usb ports in the front , or you just need a couple extra usb ports , then this is a good way to get them
lastly , some other reviewer wrote ( repeatedly ) about the number <NUM> being in the wrong place , err
i didn not even notice and even if that is true and there is some kind of "ergonomic keyboard book of law" , which i doubt , i never had any problem adjusting to it
hope my review helped !
i understand this keyboard is no no longer easily available
i bought one at a local store for $3
83 and am happy with it
the keys are rather loud and but its study
the blue bottons on the top arent that useful
but its a very comfortable keyboard to use
i like the wrist rest especially and the works well
i like the usb ports on the kb , i plug my usb mouse into one and the other is free for now
highly recommended if you can find one .
ok , i admit it - i have only used this keyboard for one day but couldn not wait to write a review
first off , i can rightly claim to be an official mac enthusiast/fanatic since buying my 1st computer ( blue &amp ; white g3 , 350mhz ) in <NUM> and understand some of the mac community is loathing of microsoft
but if a product works this terrifically for the mac , even if it is a microsoft product , then we should show our support for the mac by buying the superior product
when apple offers an equally fine i will trade this one in for that , but at this time they don not have one
i have experienced the superior ergonomics of the isplit' keyboard design for a couple of years now with the adesso truform keyboard , which is also a fine keyboard , but this one from microsoft is a cut above the rest
note that i have also briefly tried the datadesk ismartboard' which was also a fine product but the keys on that board made very audible 'clicking' sounds - a real distraction when you are used to isilent' keys
fortunately , the microsoft keyboard keys are very quiet
the keyboard is indeed wide but not as wide as the adesso keyboard
the keys on this microsoft board are soft to the touch , but with a responsiveness that i find perfect ( not 'mushy' like the apple pro keyboard )
just plug in the usb cable and you are ready to go , though there is a cd included that contains some very useful software to allow you to reprogram many of the hot keys to your liking and to mirror those keys that are on the mac keyboard , such as the command and option keys ( all reprogramming was super easy and worked flawlessly for me )
all the keys worked as advertised : the volume control keys , the internet ( they work with ie or netscape ) , the reprogrammed apple 'command' keys , and more
the comments about the product is plastics feeling cheap are totally unfounded - this is a solid product with thick plastic moldings throughout
the cd also installs informative hmtl help files on the subject of proper keyboard usage ( posture , symptoms , etc
) ; this is really a complete package
if you are someone that is about to embark on the blissful path of the then this is the keyboard to buy - it is the best one one out there for the mac
you won not turn back .
i have had this keyboard for about years now
i have the dell verision ( "dell by microsoft" ) , which i think is the same as the original microsoft one , but just has "dell" branded on the right corner
it is a good , sturdy keyboard , however , it is very loud
the other keyboards i have ( 4 of them ) are not half as loud as this one
i just bought a new microsoft erognomic keyboard for my wife , and it is very nice , quiet .
i have been using this keyboard for about two years now and i think it is the best keyboard i have ever used
i use many diffrent keyboards ( at school , friends house , laptop ) and none of them compare to this keyboard
when i first started using this keyboard i was a &quot ; hunt and peck&quot ; typist but over time i became a touch typist and this keyboard is perfect for that
i dont have any pain using it for hours at a time ( compared with other keyboards )
i would recommend this keyboard to anyone
the two usb ports are also a great feature since i plug my microsoft intellimouse optical ( a fantastic mouse ) into it and it reduces wire clutter .
this keyboard is an acquired taste
once you put the time into using it , typing on it for hours at a time is definitely easier on the hands
it does have a clackity clack sound when typing and i had to make a special wrist support pad ( 2 by <NUM> cut with a bandsaw to fit the contours and a gel pad on top )
the keyboard is roomier ( and larger ) and i learned to touch type on it
put small felt dots on the f and j keys to make it easier to get your fingers on the home keys
with the new intellikeyboard software , i remapped all of the gray buttons to things like word , explorer , cut , copy , paste , next application , open , close , exit , print and more ! its like having the new ms office keyboard with the ergo that i crave
i simply cannot type on a slab anymore
too cramped , too quiet , and too painful .
i have been a fan of the ms natural keyboards since they came out , working at microsoft when they did , i made sure i had as many of them as i could
turns out my hoarding was appropriate given their next offering , the natural keyboard elite , was such a disappointment
so it was with great pleasure i found , after snapping one up on release day , that the third time is a charm
first off , it retains the split design of its forebears which is so much easier on the wrists
the control buttons across the top are a nice addition , i use the media controls the most when playing songs in winamp , and poke the larger email button to launch outlook2k
the internet browser controls are of less use if you have grown accustomed to navigation using regular keystrokes , they are tougher to get to rather than just a quick f5 etc
the travel between key presses has been lessened , so you don not have to push as far on , say , the ctrl button to activate it as you did in the first version
this tends to produce a little cushier typing experience but it is worth it
they also returned the beloved inverted t arrow controls , instead of the horrid cross of the elite
this design is preferable when playing games w/out joysticks or mice like a quick round of mame32 emulated
should also mention the presence of the two usb ports in the back for mouse/trackball use
the keyboard itself comes w/ a dual usb/ps/2 connector and is physically smaller than the original
being on computers 10+ hours a day i have this keyboard and the logitech marble trackman fx [see review] on all my machines , work and home
highly recommended .
i received this product as a gift
it took about and hour or two to get used to the split keyboard , but it was smooth sailing after that
the only problem that i had ( which was resolved a few hours after use ) , was the quieter key action when typing
it does not take much pressure to type on the keyboard , which is a bit of change for me
this was however , resolved a few hours after use
i find that my hands and fingers get fatigued less often than with my previous keyboard , just a standard flat keyboard
i have also noticed that my typing speed has increased , being that it is more comfortable to type
what i really like about the keyboard is the shortcut keys , a feature for any keyboard
i do not use many usb devices , but when i do , it is very handy to have <NUM> ports right at the keyboard
the microsoft natural keyboard pro is an excellent product , after the short 'learning curve' , it allowed me to type faster , and more comfortably than ever before
i would recommend this to anyone who expirences any type of fatigue when using a traditional kayboard , or would rather type more naturally ( hence the name ; ) .
after using this keyboard for several months , i have concluded that while it works pretty much as promised , sometimes a company can take an uncomplicated product like a keyboard and goose it up so much that it becomes too complicated for its purpose
that is the case with this product
my keyboard rests in a drawer and the buttons at the top of the keyboard sometimes hit the top of the drawer starting my email program etc
plus , i could never get the <NUM> usb ports to work properly
finally , i don not type any faster on the &quot ; natural&quot ; keyboard and when friends and relatives use it , they complain bitterly
i should have stuck with a simple keyboard with all of these bells and whistles
my mistake
not microsoft is
but think about this before you buy this product .
i found that i can type far faster on this keyboard than i can on a straight keyboard , which was a pleasant surprise
i expected it to be more comfortable to use ( and it is ) , but the speed increase was a nice bonus
the keys have just the right amount of resistance for high speed typing
of course , the standard warning about this kind of keyboard is : only buy a "natural" keyboard if you are a touch typist ! if you hunt and peck , you will hate this keyboard
the keys are a really nice touch
best of all , they work without you having to do a lot of setup
; - ) this keyboard can be connected to your computer via the usb port , or the ps2 port , or both
that is really important , because all the information i could find on this keyboard never made this quite clear
for me , it was crucial that only the usb connection be required for my laptop , because my laptop has no keyboard connector whatsoever
for my desktop , i have both usb and ps2 , so i went ahead and plugged in both
if you only have usb , you will not be able to use your keyboard until the machine has booted at least up to the windows password prompt
if you have a bios password , and you are not using the ps2 connector , you will have to enter the password another way ( like by using the irritating , mushy keyboard built into your laptop )
one complaint that i have is that it is very hard to use the ctrl keys
you have to get your hands pretty far out of home position to hit them , and it is awkward
i write software for a living , and i use ctrl characters all the time , so i find this a bit annoying
however , overall i find the experience to be supperior to using a straight keyboard .
i spent a fair amount of dithering before i bought this keyboard
not that it is excessively expensive
rather , it looked a bit of an ugly duckling up there on the shelf and i wasn not sure if it would be comfortable enough
on my third trip to the shelf , i finally studied it a bit more carefully
i noticed the little messages on the keys to remind my failing mind of control functions
i noticed the special function keys that provided web navigation , media control , instant access to my computer and the calculator , and the sleep key
i noticed the volume control keys
i remember that i hadstarted to turn off the sound on my klisch 4
1 is because their volume occasionally gave the cats heart attacks
i figured , &quot ; what the heck , i have made dumber mistakes&quot ; and brought one home
i already had an old , grungy intellipoint keyboard , so intallation took about <NUM> seconds of hardware time and a minute to install the software
&quot ; so far so good&quot ; i say to myself
one star for installation
test one : typing
ooh the extra large wrist rest that looked so ugly in the store looks pretty good
and the angle feels a bit better
the keys have a nice thunk and a springy feel
one star for feel
next i try the volume control - wow ! the look of worry vanishes from the cat is faces
the rest of the media keys work fine and the internet navigators are great
when i hit the sleep button my machine does exactly that
one star for cool features
the software is simplicity itself
adjustments for speed , language , hotkeys , some special options and a nifty little on screen display for keys like volume
everything works just great ! one star for easy of use and clear instructions
the last star is for the two usb ports on the back of the keyboard
this basically changes one of the usb ports from the back of my machine into two on my desk
works great for a mouse and , in my case , a zip drive
i have gotten used to the original funny shaped intellitype
this new model seems like the perfect set of improvements in functionality and ergonomics
given the amount of time i spend with my fingers on the keyboard it is well worth the money .
let me first say i really like this keyboard
i have severe tendonitis , and it is a lifesaver
both the layout of the keys and the key action ( softer than normal ) contribute to the increased comfort
i am a &quot ; keyboard person&quot ; ( as opposed to being a mouse user ) , and i use the cursor ( arrow ) keys a lot
i tried to use the microsoft natural elite keyboard , but found its diamond arrangement and cursor keys impossible to get used to
this keyboard has the keys in the traditional layout
if you ever use the cursor keys , spend the extra money for this pro model instead of the elite ! i also really appreciate the intellitype software that comes with the keyboard
it used to drive me crazy to accidentally hit the caps lock key
with the intellitype software , you can disable the caps lock entirely ( among many other customizations ) -- problem solved ! so why didn not i give this product <NUM> stars ? two reasons : first , the function keys are smaller than normal
i would have preferred them to be full size
second , the hot keys are dark blue with icons molded into them
the problem is that the icons are not easily visible at a glance
it would have been far better to paint the icons white for high contrast and easy legibility
as it is , it is annoying that i have to scan the buttons to find the one i want
good idea , poor execution
still even with these minor flaws , i love this keyboard and heartily recommend it .
the keyboard itself is fine
i like the feel of the keys
the programmable keys are pretty good ( it'd be nice if more than a few were customizable )
my biggest complaint - and it is a big one - is that i have found the intellitype software ( which allows you to program the keys ) to be a cause of keyboard system errors ( hello blue screen )
it is done this multiple times on my dell winme system , to the point where i had to get rid of intellitype for good ( the piece of junk - this was the winme version 1
2 )
i just use the keyboard without the programmable features , and i like it
however , if i were doing it again i'd get a cheaper ( ) model and save money
get whatever keyboard has the most comfortable keys for you - microsoft has competitors too
i know this , intellitype isn not going anywhere near my system again .
i have tendonitis in my wrist so finding something that was comfortable and unobtrusive was essential
this keyboard fit the bill perfectly
i now use this keyboard both at home and at work
it is a tired analogy , but it rings true here : using this keyboard is like trying on that pair of jeans that fit you just right
you won not want to go back to anything less
everyone asks the same question : isn not this keyboard hard to get used to ? i too thought it would take weeks , but i was comfortable with it after two days ( ~8 hrs/day )
i find the wrist rest to be quite good and the row of keys are a nice bonus feature ( great to be able to mute your music or adjust the volume with a quick keypress , especially if you use headphones )
no regrets , but there are two downsides you should be aware of : 1 ) you may become more sensitive to keyboards ( i get aches after using any cramped laptop keyboard now ; normal keyboards are still ok , just less comfortable ) , and 2 ) the of the function keys makes them a bit of a chore to get used to .
i have had this keyboard for over a year and have dumped several glasses of pop and water into it
it is still working fine and the usb hub is very convienient if you have a digital camera , or ipaq , etc
no problems whatsoever !
i tried very hard to like this keyboard , but i just couldn not
though it has a lot of very cool special function buttons , it fails to do the basic thing a keyboard should do : be comfortable to type on
and the packaging is mildly misleading about the nature of the usb ports
i didn not find anything particularly "ergonomic" about the keyboard
the curve of the board is just a little too steep for my hands
it is awkward getting to the extreme upper corners , such as the "backspace" key
i found the distorted size of the bottom row of keys hard to get used to as well
and the hand rest can not be detached
most disappointingly , the key action is awkward and loud
i am not sure i have ever encountered any keyboard which felt worse under my fingertips
even the version of this keyboard has keys that feel better
likewise , the usb ports are a mixed bag
though prominent among the advertised features , the usb ports aren not sufficiently explained on the packaging
you don not actually increase the total number of usb ports on your system by two
you must plug the keyboard into an existing usb port , so you get a net gain of only one port
and they are unpowered ports which means you can not plug bigger usb devices--like hubs , printers , and scanners--into them and expect great results
this is not a way to add usb functionality to your system ; it only rearranges where the ports are
this redistribution does have its utility , however
game controllers , microphones , and digital audio player downloads can be moved forward to the keyboard
if you find yourself crawling under your desk all the time to switch out your smaller usb devices , this keyboard will add some needed convenience to your life
in sum , i strongly advise anyone who is thinking of buying this keyboard to test it first
find a demonstration model in a computer store and try typing on it
if you like it , fine : come back here and buy it
as long as you understand the limitations of the usb ports and can deal with the key action , the keyboard is actually a good value for money
but while you are testing keyboards , make sure you try a whole range of them
get one that is really comfortable for your just one that seems to be cool .
the title sums it up
this is the best , and most comfortable keyboard i have ever used
i am a very fast touch typist , with a very heavy touch since i learned on mechanical typewriters ( remember those ? not even an electrical assist
this keyboard lets me go faster , gives me far , far less fatigue and repetitive stress pain than any other , and ought to be the standard
as i said , i bang the keys pretty hard
the natural keyboard pro just keeps on working happily ; mine is at least <NUM> years old and going strong
normally i bash an ibm or dell ( or any other ) keyboard into destruction within a year .
this keyboard is great
the are addictive
but , i would recommend spending the extra money to get the pro natural version
its worth the money for the extra hot buttons and usb hub
especially lately because everything you now buy is usb .
i love this keyboard and i use it one at work and at home ! a clean , traditional key layout with shortcut buttons that actually work thanks to the excellent intellitype software
the key response is the best i have used since the old ibm keyboards of the 1980 is
the keys are solid , stiff and emit a nice tactile click when you press them
you won not find any keyboard flex or mushy/spongy key response that you will find in some of the cheaper , keyboards you can buy [elsewhere] for [less]
microsoft has done their homework with this one ! the included wristrest completes this great setup
if you are looking for a basic keyboard and don not require dozens of quickstart keys or the latest rf/wireless model , you'd be hard pressed to find anything better than this one
take it from me , i use mine all day at work and at home on my own pc !
the standard ms keyboard has that tactile feel that most modern keyboards lack
go look on ebay for the keyboards from the 80 is
they carry a high premium because of how they were made
how the keys sound , respond , and feel
this is not as good as that
but it is much better than most anything you will find in stores now
i am not sure why they don not go back and at least offer one of the 80 is style keyboards for say $100 in their line up
it makes typing so much easier , quicker , and more pleasant .
i can not give this thing <NUM> stars for a few reasons
none of them being bad reasons , just personal issues
as far as the keyboard itself
it is absolutely wonderful
you won not get the tactile feel of most keyboards as this is a very light typer
i love that though as a personal choice
new keyboards tend to take some getting used to but this one required practically no time at all
the only thing it really is missing , to me , is audio control built in
now this may not be the idea of this type of kb at all , but it would have been a real nice addition
even at the cost of $ extra
it still would have been more than worth this price
now , don not buy this here
keep in the game amazon or take this off your site because your not doing anyone any favors at this price .
i have used just about every keyboard on the market , but this one is certainly my favorite
i have got four of them
two at work and two at home
they never seem to wear out like other keyboards and take a considerable beating
once , a coworker was helping me move my desk and put my keyboard on the floor
he began picking up the monitor ( a 17&quot ; ) , but it slipped out of his hands and landed on the poor keyboard
a dozen keys shot off and the little 'feet' on the bottom of it snapped out
that was six months ago
that same keyboard is still in my office and working perfectly
you can not beat that .
i bought this keyboard a few years ago at a store
i feel in love with the touch on it while testing it out there
all was well for years
then one morning my cat knocked my mug of coffee over and it poured all down right into the keyboard
i had no hopes to finding a replacement , but did
it arrived quickly , same old keyboard in stunning new shape
i should buy another
keyboards with a nice touch are very difficult to come by
the programmed button shortcuts are handy too
can not say a bad thing about it
i am not much for wrist rests but i even like the one that comes with this keyboard
it is a ps/2 interface , which means it is the round plug in , not the rectangular usb one
make sure you have an ps/2 to usb adopter on hand if you don not have a ps/2 interface .
i have had this keyboard for years now
i really do not use the &quot ; internet&quot ; keys , but i really like the calculator key , seeing how im always looking to do a quick calculation
it might not be as quite as other keyboards , but the keys feel fine to push , and after years they have not broke or got stikky , and i have used it alot daily
the arm rest is the best feature , along with the huge spacebar
the keys feel very natural , and i like how they slope up
well worth the money
~hope this helps
although it is made of plastic , it works !
i bought a second one
what was missing was those donut disc that fit over the bulb to block rain from going into the socket .
not the greatest , but after a month it is still working great
i wish it had more than 1 , 5 and <NUM> minutes light time though , but for $12 you can not really go wrong ! i am running the 23watt ge cfls and it all works flawlessly .
perhaps this is stated in the product description , but this product wouldn not work at all with the electrical box i have on the outside of my home
my box requires a metal bracket that goes across diagonally where there is a screw hole in the middle , this product requires a box where there are <NUM> screws at each point of the square
the product is also all plastic , very cheap , but that is not really a knock since it is also very cheaply priced .
this is the worst light i have ever owned never worked and when it did stay lit it would leave me in the dark
the only reason i did not return it was i needed it to pass an electrical inspection
i purchased this product based on other customer reviews and the price
arrived on time , and it installed easily without any problem
i have had it for about <NUM> months now and it is still working great
good product for the price !
this is about the best deal on outdoor lighting i have ever seen
easy to install , worked the first time
yes , you do need to caulk around it to keep mosture from getting into the seam , but i do that with every outdoor project .
i read the reviews and quite frankly ; i am baffled
though some of the reviews gave this light a bad review ; i am not
this is a great light , it picks up the slightest movement and that is exactly what i needed
the span of it was surprisingly wide and on cue when tested
if you need a cheap but good light , this is it .
i bought <NUM> and both stop working within <NUM> months
moisture got into the cheap plastic sensor housing and shorted out
i should have spent the extra money and got a better built unit .
i mounted two of these on my deck and they work just fine although for just a little more money i could have ordered the that has a wider sensing range ( 150 degrees ) , is provided with more mounting options , and has lamp holders that are easier to adjust
the color of this fixture is more ivory and the was more white .
after installation two of the four fixtures did not come on after dark
after a long minute phone wait i finally spoke to a helpline person at heath zenithand they assured me i would get two replacements mailed to me
i did get one replacement and have again sent a request for a second replacement
the two units that work are doing well and have no issues
i will buy a different unit next time as these obviously have a high failure rate , probablythat is why the price is so cheap .
a good one of these can last <NUM> years
a bad one doesn not last <NUM> weeks
either way , getting the whole fixture and chucking everything bar the sensor saves $ over buying just the sensor
crazy , landfill madness but what you gonna do .
great for the price
but very plastic
it works and is up doing what it is suppose to do
i wouldn not buy another
i would pay more for an led one now .
the mounting holes of this light are <NUM> degrees off the vertical or horizontal axis of the holes on the electrical box
it is impossible to mount correctly without some unsightly drilling .
i bought this from amazon and have installed it under the eaves of the house in the back yard
it works very well but has a narrower sense angle than the newer model that i purchased at over twice the price at home depot
the one from amazon seems to be an older model on clearance
i also added a simple ac powered audible beep alarm to this heath motion sensing light , so now it emits a single moderately loud "beep" whenever the zenith / heath sensor detects an intrusion and the flood lights come on
this modification required connecting an external home brew "beeper box" between the two red and neutral wires coming out of the rear of the unit .
its a decent motion sensor that can be added to pretty much any light fixture with space to add it .
its cheaper than buying a new light , and it works great ! have not had an issue
has good range , and only works at night , it that is what you want .
we'd had a sensor fail on an existing light and i ordered this to replace it
the older unit was from a different manufacturer , but looked identical and carried the same model number
installation was straightforward--i simply removed the existing wire nuts , removed the old unit from the light housing , and reversed the process to install the new one
it works dependably , as advertised
this was a much cheaper option than buying a new motion flood light fixture .
bought three of these to detect motion around the deck and pool area and activate several flood lights and wall sconce units simultaneously
the instructions say this has to be wired to a switched circuit , but i have no idea why
worked fine coming right off a live circuit
coverage is probably a little less than 180d but it worked well for me
the instructions don not cover this
if you want to add multiple sensors to a single ( or multiple lights ) simply get some 14/3+g wire and wire it up like you would a <NUM> way switch ( or get an electrician to do it )
i love the idea that we have got such broad motion detection coverage from the three sensors and all the lighting works simultaneously
little more complicated ( and expensive ) wiring job , but much better for me than having individual units that work independently .
range said to be <NUM> feet but in reality it appears to be more like <NUM> feet
next time i will go with a new led model .
these replaced the sensors in my motion detector lights easily and worked perfectly
i was glad not to have to replace the entire lamp
not exciting or inexpensive enough for five stars .
i was glad to be able to just buy the sensor rather than replace the entire fixture
it was an easy replacement ( turn the breaker off first )
the unit has sensitivity adjustment and instructions as to angle so you neighbor does not light your yard while getting his newspaper <NUM> feet away
it has worked very reliable for several months in some nasty weather .
if your motion sensor isn not working on distances over <NUM> feet get this one
i started out with this one and a <NUM> watt halogen rectangular light
the sensor worked but the <NUM> watt halogen did not put out enough light for my cameras
i removed both and installed an "all in one" "sensor + light" combo with screw in bulbs so i could use two <NUM> watt par <NUM> ge flood light screw in bulbs
now i had plenty of light but the motion sensor was not working at the distance i needed
i removed the wires from the "all in one"sensor and reinstalled this sensor and now all is great
try and steal my mail now , just make sure you smile for the camera
: ) here are the bulbs i used that work great - <URL>
i bought one of these at home depot and it cost me twice as much as this on line purchase from amazon
when the perimeter lights fail , this is the gadget that dies
if you are up to the job , just replace the sensor
everything is color coded
what i did was build my own motion detected perimeter light set up using this for the sensor
it cost me less than buying one as a unit .
this device was a replacement for the exact same model
the old one didn not work and this one does as expected .
had a pair of these for about <NUM> years and they still work
i am replacing <NUM> sensors that were burned during a storm and a surge
cannot say anything bad about the zenith sensors because they are ( and have been ) reliable for years .
it was easy to replace the defective sensor
it has been in service for several months and comes on every time i expect it to be on
i have it on for and it always goes off on time
the daylight sensor works as designed .
my last heath/zenith sensor on newly installed light lasted about <NUM> years
i thought i would have to buy the whole unit , but glad they sell just the sensor
box said it needs to be hooked up to a light switch , but i didn not
i don not understand why that was needed
the original sensor came with a green ground wire
this sensor does not
not sure how that will affect anything since the fixture itself is grounded to the electrical system anyway
this sensor turns the light on full bright right now
my original sensor ramped up the light over a second or two
no directions , so just pay attention
white to white , black to black and red to red
pretty strait forward .
this works great i wired it into the porch lights to turn on when someone is on the porch at night
i hacked this into a plain inexpensive porch light i got at osh
works well
it does do a false trip when headlight from a car shines at it , which doesn not bother me
if people are bothered by this , they shouldn not get in their cars
the photo cell is a nice feature , keeping the unit off during daylight hours .
on my shed , i had two separate motion detector flood light fixtures
i wanted both to come on when letting my dogs out at night since they lit both side and rear areas of my yard but the rear one would not trip unless it saw enough motion in front of it which was generally seldom
so i wired this one into the side of the shed after replacing it with a standard lamp holder and wired the second lamp holder to the rear of the shed with it
now , both fixtures light as soon as you step off the deck lighting the whole yard up .
replaces the old sensor for my outside garage driveway light
could not get these here for some reason
only expensive commercial versions .
actually , i think they are better than the sensors ( i bought 2 ) that came with the lights
my original zenith sensors became erratic after <NUM> years outside here in colorado
also those sensors were the &<HASHTAG> ; dual brite&<HASHTAG> ; type , a feature i never liked or used
this new sensor seems more solidly built - heavier and well sealed against weather
to replace the sensor i removed the entire light from the fixture box , unscrewed the sensor from the plate and cut the <NUM> color coded wires
then i matched the colors of the new sensor to the wires i just cut , black - black , white - white and brown - red
my sensor came with a brown wire not a red wire as the match to the red wire of the light
i used simple insulated crimp connectors - available at any big box store , possibly even
then installation was the reverse of removal
before you put the light back on the fixture box , align and aim the lights and sensor as best you can , its easier to do it at the work bench than up on a ladder
one small drawback , my lights are white and the sensor brown , so its a mismatch in color
i would have ordered a white , but did not see one offered
its does not bother me but someone concerned with exterior color matching might want a white sensor .
i replaced my old outside motion sensor with this
it fit perfectly where the old one was , works great and looks good .
i haven not hooked it up yet , so can not really say a lot about it except it was a great price for what i wanted it for ; lights & alarm .
this is a great model for the price
amazon price is much better than most
it has the minimal functional controls but more controls would mean a higer cost and more prone to failure
buy <NUM> because the things do not last for ever outside .
i had ordered this along with two <NUM> watt led flood lights
the lights came right away but waited over two weeks for the sensor
so i purchased a heath/zenith ( different model ) locally
i wouldn not work
this one finally arrived and it works great
bought as a replacement for an old unit that hung up at times ( leaving the lights on after sunrise )
despite some warnings it works well with a few watts of led lamps for load .
yes , it works , but the effective range is only about 1/3 of the advertised <NUM> feet , or about <NUM> feet ! the cost is small enough , but i'd rather pay more and get one that does the job
i have found that all of these have a limited lifespan , anyway
can anyone tell me where i can get a decent motion detector ?
my review is targeted primarily at the previous purchase of the same item
they seem to last about <NUM> to <NUM> months then the motion detection quits working
i did try other brands but seems these type of devices have a limited life span
i kept the old one for repurpose since the optical light sensor continues to work .
had to replace the motion sensor on my old unit
old unit was about <NUM> years old
nice to still find this
hd and lowes wants you to replace the whole unit .
i needed to move my existing primary phone with message recorder into the room i use all the time ( i am a )
this was an easy , inexpensive , fast way to do this
we ran the cord along the baseboard and held it with those velcro easy removal sticky strips
it is great and removes the necessity of going into a room that is chockfull of barriers for my scooter just to retrieve messages on the rare occasions i have to leave the house
it was done just a few days after buying this cord since it arrived only a couple days later
amazon to the rescue again !
though it is longer than i needed it works perfectly
no shorts or wire noise
both ends seem well affixed to wire .
i needed to extend a phone in my apartment without having to drill holes in the wall
so , i decided to purchased this 25ft cable which arrived promptly
unlike others on the market that are flimsy , this one is of good quality and works just as advertised
i'd definitely recommend it to my friends or anyone who is looking for a phone extension .
i bought this to use with the xantrex pro sine inverterxantrex technologies prosine <NUM> prosine 1 , 000 to 1 , power inverterbecause behind the <NUM> screws on the front control/lcd display panel there exists a simple modular plug to extend the panel <NUM> feet from the inverter
i never even ran phone traffic over the cord ! but it worked great for extending the circuit between the control panel and the inverter - the lcd still shows the data display , and the on/off switch still works normally even with the inverter <NUM> feet from its normally built in controller
for the price , i could not be happier - it came fast and solved a complex problem with very little money spent
alot of things use modular jacks in audio , telephone , key systems , etc
just be sure the number of wires matches ( there are <NUM> versions of this plug - the <NUM> , the <NUM> inc this one , and the <NUM> but used in alarm systems quite a bit
when remodeling a modular extension may allow you to move your alarm keypad to the other side of a new door or have some other feature panel that uses a <NUM> wire modular plug moved
beware some extensions reverse the wires - e
the rightmost wire on the plug is now the leftmost on the jack - while this will work with phones , it wont work on gear meant to use straight through wired plug/jack extensions
using an ohm meter you should see the leftmost contact on the plug makes a nearly <NUM> ohm connection with the leftmost contact on the jack , and not to any other wires in the jack
great accessory for phones too !
simple extention cable i needed to run to get phone service to the other room in my house
works as it should .
i needed this wire to extend the phone wire to the jack and what a great job it did ! it sounds like the jack is <NUM> feet away ! no quality issues at all !
this is officially compatible with dymo is : - labelmanager 350 , 450 , pcii- labelpoint 350- labelwriter duobut it works just fine with the dymo labelmanager 360d which is not on the list
on this cassette , the tape needed a little bit of 'priming' - had to manually pull about one inch out before anything could come out but all was flawless after that
the output is the expected black on white and , according to the maker , the nylon base should make the labels stick perfectly to curved surfaces
in areal life' the labels stickiness do meet my standards but i will have to live with at least some air bubbles when applying them on curved objects
nice labels
made in belgium .
dymo is probably the only product i will ever use
the king of labels
you can not go wrong with the best
easy to load system , anyone can use it .
dymo is a leader in label printers , i use them at work and at home
tape is what they advertised
waayyy too expensive , but all label tape seems to be .
this labeling tape is pretty good , and it is darn near impossible to screw it up : drop it into the label machine , type up your label ( s ) , have it print , then peel off the backing and apply
i actually love these labels vs
what i have used in the past as it is truly a print , peel , and stick type of label with no mess and crisp , fonts
this tape is also much better than the tape that originally came with the machine as this tape is much longer and will last for a lot more labels
to top everything else off as i type this review , i saved a little over $10 as the price i paid on amazon was $14
34 vs
99 for the same exact roll at the office depot down the street .
this is a good consumable product to make labels with , prints good and is sticky
a good value and works well with the rhino label maker i have
i bought this in conjunction with the label maker for those special label making occasions
works well and would purchase again .
i mostly use this tape outdoors because this one does not seem to fade much outdoors and has great adhesive
the other plastic tape i tried ( black on white ) doesn not seem to have good adhesive .
i personally don not see any problem with this product
it is easy to put in a new cartrige and to take on out
however the cartridges do seem a little expensive , but they last pretty long
i have never had one jam yet either .
i got this as a refill for my labeler
this is the kind of tape i always buy
it works well and i also have it in other colors
they have a variety
good price .
pros : uses less batteries than the space shuttle
( 6 aas ) great idea gone to h* quickly due to lack of product support ! apparently the person in charge of designing and marketing tapes for these units suffers from attention deficit disorder and is totally unable to remotely consider any meaningful complete line of tapes
red , blue , white pearl ( paper ? ) - yellow smiley faces
green metalic
black on clear - but no white on clear
there appears to be little , if any , hope for those who might actually like to color code products in any single medium - plastic , paper , polyester , metallic , etc
just whatever come to the designer is head is what is released
five types here
two there
one over here
no rhyme nor reason
dymo has done themselves no favors here !
im using this to protect labelit is clearyou can put it above your already printed labelsthan you
i have <NUM> dymo letra tag label makers and in general i like them
i use the plastic tape to label my spice jars
while the print holds up to the frequent handling , the labels don not stay stuck to the glass bottles
no matter how carefully i clean the jars before applying the label they start peeling from one end or the other ( and sometimes both )
they also don not like to stick to the plastic caps
i am disappointed with this product , but haven not found anything better
btw - the metallic tape was no better .
worked as intended and would buy again
had no issues with these at all and i like how there are multiple styles of labels to use .
i had the labelmaker and the &<HASHTAG> ; paper&<HASHTAG> ; labels
they washed right off of the kids lunch containers
when i bought the laminted ones , they are still on months later
they arrived in perfect condition and earlier than expected
thank you .
this and the label maker is my best friend
i love labeling everything
from school supplies to putting my name and number on my expensive electronics just in case it gets stolen
not only are these great for everything in the house or office , but amazon is also the cheapest place you can get these
walmart has them at a higher price
also if you are a prime member , these ship prime if you have more than <NUM> dollars in your cart
i can not emphasize enough ; get refills
if you are like me , i use this daily and go through these like water
you won not regret these .
i mean what can you really say about it
its labeling tape
but looks good , very sticky , and definitely better then the paper kind
the paper gets dirty quick , this plastic stays clean .
i purchased them when i purchased the label maker and they all came in the same package
i am glad i did that now i have refills .
i am not sure this is really <NUM> ft
fed well into the dymo unit
color good
probably would not buy again though .
black letters on white background are clear dense and sharp
despite the the complaints of other reviewers , i have not had problems with print quality , sticking to smooth surfaces ( glass spice bottles , metal surfaces , etc )
you can not beat the price with amazon prime , under $5
50 to your door in two days
dymo has always been the gold standard in label machines since i was in elementary school in the early 1960s and we had the manual "label embosser" machine
very pleased .
this was $2 more at office max ( with tax ) and i would have to spend $ in gas to get there
got the same item for less and free delivery with amazon prime
i use these labels on everything , including kegs of homebrew beer
the labels stay on even if the keg sweats , but peel off when i need to refill the keg .
these labels are ok
they stick to most surfaces as expected
i will probably buy again since i have the label machine but i wish they would stick to all surfaces .
bought this for my dymo label maker
the price is much cheap than at local office stores
the tape has split backing , which helps with aligning it .
this plastic labeling tape works well in my letratag , and the printed labels look great at first
however , i find that the white color of the labels does not hold up in areas ( even indirect light )
when i moved into a new home , i applied these labels to light switch wallplates so that i wouldn not need to guess what the switches do
the labels adhere well , and after a year , none peeled or fell off
sadly , however , the white unprinted areas of the labels have begun turning yellow or tan , and even in rooms that receive lots of light
none of the labels are exposed to direct sunlight , only light that bounces around the room from windows
i am a bit disappointed with the poor longevity of these labels
soon , i will need to remove and reprint my labels because a brown label looks pretty bad on a white wallplate
thankfully , because the labels are made of plastic , they usually pull off in one piece without leaving much residue .
the product is exactly what i ordered and works with my label maker even though it is a older model
i really love the dymo label and they are 1/2 the price as through local merchants
you get two for the price of one ! a++
i use this and the black on white mostly and have never had any trouble with this product
it works in my dymo and is cost effective
recommended .
i bought the dymo label maker a couple years ago and couldn not figure out why it would print only the bottom of each character
i changed the batteries and checked to see that the labeling tape was in correctly without a change in the printing
after reading some reviews i thought it was possible that my labeling tape was just bad -- ordered a new one -- and now have perfect little labels .
dymo labelling tape for a dymo label maker
what could be simpler ? fits properly , prints well and has plenty of tape .
well , it is labeling tape
it works great and the backing material is split so it is easy to get it off .
got it in a very timely manner
love being able to label various items , wish that it was dish washer resistant , or at least lasted longer from washing .
easy to use , fast , really trasnparent and the ink doesn not smear or smudge in it
easy to peel ( fold it in half )
these are just what i was looking for and they work really well for labeling items
mostly , they are durable and don not seem to fade over time as others do
try them , i think that you will like them .
my label maker ran out ions ago and had been sitting in a drawer in my desk
i discovered it again and looked on amazon for replacement label tape
great price and shipped quickly .
it is the only label tape we order and use
it is always a great product so we highly recommend for use
my girl has a label machine , and loves using it
these are quality replacement rolls
i would recommend to anyone .
i use labels on nearly everything to keep myself organized
the clear ones are for items that a colored label would stick out on and i don not want it to
these are on mostly clear boxes that i still need to see through without the labels getting in the way
i have most of the colors on these , but i seem to use the clear a lot more than others .
i have the dymo letra tag label maker and i love it
i have one at work and one at home
excellent purchase for being the organized person that i am .
i purchased this here on amazon becuase of the ease of ordering and price , both of which are great
this tape is also great - sticks to various surfaces , even some rough surfaces ( have hammered finish cabinets that they stuck to )
recommended for your dymo label maker !
fits the label printer well and labels print and stick well to a variety of surfaces
good price point to always have extra rolls on hand .
i really can not live without my ; i use it for absolutely everything
in addition , it is very affordable
it is the greatest !
this is dymo labeling tape as described
it seems to work just fine
i would buy this dymo labeling tape again .
i use them to label my spray bottles , boxes and many others things and they have yet to fall off
perfect so far and only $5 &change , i first started using the paper labels on my collectible magazine/comics & i was so impressed after 8/10 years they have yet to peel off
i only which the rolls would be longer maybe 18/20 feet .
remember the old , stiff plastic labels that were embossed by the label making machine ? these are nothing like those ! the labels produced with this tape are nice and thin and look professional .
i like this tape to use for items that are easy to recognize across the way
not quite as bright as it could be still better than standard white .
i am a label freak
these are the plastic ones
black lettering on white background
they resist moisture
use this when you need moisture protection .
this dymo letratag labeling tape is perfect for making the black text stand out
if i use one of the larger fonts on my letratag label maker , i can see the type from across the room
that is very handy to identify items or if an item is on a shelf , where it might otherwise be difficult to view
i like the background because there are not many packages or other items that have this shade as their background
that makes these labels standout
they are easy to identify as something i have labeled
in addition , i label everything , from the contents of a cabinet shelf , to boxes and bins i do not want to open ( , i would have opened a bin <NUM> times to determine its contents - no longer ) , to file folders , to the back of all my electronics in case i lose one
that is just the tip of the iceberg
these labels are easy to apply , the rear of each labels backing is split in two so it is effortless
if i need to trim a label , i peel away the backing first and then use a pair of scissors to trim up without the backing
i found that if i kept trimming the labels with the backing on , i could not find the "split" on the back of my labels trimmed
since cutting most labels is quick and easy , trimming with the back off does not deter from the adhesiveness of the label
i have had no problem with these dymo labels adhering to any surface
moreover , the labels hold firmly in place , regardless of temperature variations
i use a lot of this letratag tape , and i have found amazon is price to be the best
on all variations of the letratag tape , their price is always the lowest .
this label reel fits exactly into our dymo label maker
i highly recommend this item
it is a direct manufacturer is replacement .
better than the solid white ones
and it prints better and adheres to surfaces better as well
if it doesnt print well its usually your batteries are weak sauce
product was as offered
speedy delivery
these label cartrages work perfect in my dymo lectratag label gun
great product for the price
would highly recommend this product to a friend .
these labels are extremely useful and durable , the only drawback is length of tape when you are working on printing out quite a few labels
i label everything that needs it in my reference guides , so i run out often during my studies
the quality and adhesive is top notch ! i would recommend this product to anyone looking for labeling ideas
hope that helps you with your purchasing decisionthanks for reading !
it is what it is what can i say they work
the only brand that will workin the .
couldn not find anyplace else on amazon to review the dymo letra tags
i am probably returning both models that i purchased
the more expensive model ( qx50 ) has a qwerty keyboard , but prints horribly , if at all
on a single line of bold text , it printed just about nothing
it prints of normal text , with contrast set at the highest level , very irregularly
you can see some letters but not others
this is supposed to be their newer model
the next level down ( a few bucks less ) looks more like a calculator in it is design ; long and narrow ( n10926 ? )
it prints really well ; very crisp letters even just at regular contrast
unfortunately in mode it will not center the lines , has less symbols ( i need inch marks ) , and requires <NUM> batteries to the other model is 5
( perhaps the extra power makes it print better though ? ) i am pretty disappointed
the tapes are much more expensive than the old emobossed wheel gun models they make
letratag tapes provide only <NUM> feet of tape
i wanted to make labels for my garden stakes
i am going to take a look at the brother and casio lines of label makers and hope there is something better .
you put it into the machine , type and print a label and it prints what you type
no big deal .
the labeling tape was just like the others i have used
needed it for a school project and it was perfect !
while label maker from dymo is frustrating , far from my satisfaction as it ceased working as soon as arrived , this tape works well with other label maker i am current using .
great product
worked great for my scrapbook project
wish i could have afforded more
there needs to be a sale and less on the shipping .
these are the same carded dymo white plastic refill tapes that you buy at the stores , for a lot less money .
working on a living trust estate binder and the label maker will in handy making tab labels
will provide update as i progress in this project .
the letters are always clear
this tape seems to stick better than the paper version , so i usually grab this one even though it costs more than the paper .
i loved this product right from the beginning , just from seeing how it combined the program listings from my cable and directv providers into on guide , and would automatically switch between inputs depending on what channel i selected
seems logical , but no one had ever done it before ! the <NUM> is the way to go at the moment , because you will find this so addictive that any less storage space will not be enough
i find that the standard recording quality ( which yields <NUM> hours of recording ) works fine for me at the moment with both my dss and cable programming , considering it is better than i was getting with vhs
i suppose that if you get hooked on the better quality , it would probably be hard to go back
i was disappointed that the <NUM> does *not* come with firewire ports as advertised here on amazon
com , as a box with future programming improvements *and* expansion possibilities was really exciting
once the copy protection issues are worked out , i'd love to be able to add another <NUM> hours to the unit with an external drive , but maybe replay will facilitate that somehow
anyhow , the bottom line is : this unit is in many ways the home entertainment appliance i have been looking for for many years
it is smart , it is convenient , and it can only get better as features are improved and small bugs are removed
when was the last time you were able to upgrade the firmware of your vcr ?
first off tivo and replay are both great products
i won not go into what is great about them , but when i was buying them , i couldn not find a good review to tell me which is better replay or tivo
when i got replaytv i was a little concerned because i read some bad things about it as compared to tivo
the main reason i got it over tivo is because it doesn not have that ball and chain $10 a month charge tivo has which adds up to $120 a year
the bad things i heard about replay were a loud fan ( which i couldn not hear at all really
if i turned everything off i heard a small tiny relaxing hum , but i couldn not really tell if it was coming from my cable box or the replaytv ) and someone said that the replay box calls long distance on his phone ( i had the option of <NUM> to <NUM> local numbers in my area )
some people also said that the software on tivo is better , i don not really know , but replay updated their software , and it will download the latest version of their software for you free
also they say the remote is a better on tivo
i really liked the remote on the 2020 , i didn not even need the instruction manual to figure it out , and tivo doesn not have the 30sec commerical skip which is very useful
as far as features and software record time and quality , i think they are both about equal , each have their strong points and the differences are not noticable
i personally think that replay has better features
but with replaytv your not stuck with that ball and chain $10 monthly bill
so if your choosing between the 2 , i say buy replaytv
i have been a replaytv owner for several months
that said , i am only somewhat satisfied with the overall quality of the system is software
i am satisfied with the replaytv hardware , with one caveat
i am not satisfied with replay customer support
with each new software release it seems that the same bugs linger and no new features appear
of course it is hard to tell what bugs replaytv is actually fixing , because they won not tell you
even when you ask
they won not tell you what improvements they are planning either
of course you can guess that they don not want to tip off any competition , but considering the product marketing blitz coming from tivo , replay needs to be forthcoming to survive
replay is missing some very nice tivo features
i have <NUM> years of experience writing software for embedded systems ( which is what replaytv is-- a sophisticated computer ) and i can not seem to understand why replaytv doesn not have a handle on some serious bugs still present in the software
while it is true , my unit doesn not flat out hang anymore , it still has some frustratingly random problems
specifically : * sometimes it forgets to record a program even when disk space is available and no recording conflicts appear in the recording schedule
* sometimes is forgets which channels i have told it to ignore and not display , and sometimes it ignores channels i ask it to display
* sometimes the software is so busy doing something ( who knows what ) that it can not keep up with the video data being written to disk , and i get a show filled with <NUM> second
( this is one manifestation of the much talked about flashing black screen ) * sometimes the box forgets how to display a picture and displays a black screen instead
* sometimes the channel guide is wrong , or when the channel , it may take several days to work the kinks out
( recently directv started offering local service , and duplicated some channels--including a special pbs channel for some customers
it took two days for replaytv to fix their channel guide
meanwhile , i was without pbs
) * sometimes the audio is not synchronized with the picture
this happens often when skipping commercials , or when using or rewind
* the &quot ; recorded shows&quot ; listing is so slow ( several seconds per line when scrolling ) , that i dread having to use it
you cannot use the /down feature here
ok , what do i like ? * multiple video inputs allow you to hook up , an antenna , and satellite service at the same time
the program information is merged into a unified program guide
that is a neat trick
* knowing a few words in a title of a movie is enough for the replaytv unit to record a show
i use this as a recording &quot ; &quot ; list
if i hear of a movie i am interested in viewing , i just add it to the list and if it is ever , it gets recorded
* the commercial skip button is neat
and even though i the program sometimes , the instant replay button takes me back a few seconds and i am back in sync
* the replaytv box controls my directv satellite receiver through a direct wired hookup between the two
in my experience , this is much more reliable than using an infrared &quot ; blaster&quot ; that emulates remote control key presses
* the user interface is somewhat spartan
frankly , i love the simplicity of it all
the channel guide is well suited to my &quot ; surfing&quot ; habits because it emulates the sony dss receiver listing format i am quite familiar with
what needs improvement : * /down in recorded shows listing* progress indicator when moving around within a recording* sorted list of recordings* control* list of upcoming scheduled recordings* when viewing a recorded program , status messages about upcoming recorded programs appear on the screen
this is bothersome when you are actually copying something important off the system--perhaps to a vcr
you need a way to turn the messages off
from a hardware standpoint , their system seems reasonable
my only complaint is that the unit runs very hot and thus may shorten its lifespan , or cause unpredictable problems when enclosed in a cabinet with an av receiver and other heat generating componentsperhaps my most frustrating complaint is the &quot ; canned&quot ; reply you receive when sending to customer support , and the lack of content when they do finally reply
yes , i *know* that it is a problem in your software
that is why i complained
how about telling me when it is going to be fixed , or what is causing it , or the tracking number you use so i can ask about it a month from now ? in summary , i give replaytv a <NUM> star rating
it mostly works
it has software problems
but i continue to rely on it , though sometimes it can be frustrating .
i just returned my replaytv 2020
it terms of a review , i'd give replay <NUM> stars , but amazon
com <NUM> stars
amazon was very gracious about the return , and i will certainly buy electronics from them again
after two weeks using replay and tivo , i'd agree with everything in photokev is review from 11/26
if tivo didn not exist , i would have kept replay , which is why i gave it <NUM> stars
its just that tivo is more reliable and has done a better job bringing a great idea to market
my replay suffered av flashes , a problem known about for a year which hasn not been solved despite several software updates
these are described by owners at avsforum
com , in case you are interested
tivo doesn not suffer this serious problem
also , its ability to select programs to record based on what you have watched is one of its best features
i didn not believe that until i tried it , but it is true
in any case , i hope this helps
finally , based on my return experience , i can certainly recommend amazon for electronics .
i have used both replay and their competitor tivo , and i have to say i am much happier with tivo
for one thing , replay included firewire ports on their original unit which they marketed as being available for adding external hard drives
after a year the software still doesn not support them and they can not say when it will ! i have also been bitten by quite a few software bugs and find their management mechanism for recorded programs to be byzantine and often surprising
i have had the unit delete a program i was watching in order to record the latest episode when it had plenty of space and was supposed to keep several episodes of the program
also , several times i have gone to watch recorded programs and found that the unit had crashed
also , if you change recording characteristics for a show ( number of episodes to store , quality , etc ) , replay deletes your currently recorded episodes ! i have also had tivo crash , but only while i was actively using it
tivo has never failed to record a program for me , and i have found their interface for managing what to be intuitive and easy to use
some of tivo is programming guides are poorly designed , though
the live pause feature of both replay and tivo is wonderful , and tivo is limited to <NUM> minutes whereas replay is limited by the amount of available space ( usually much more than <NUM> minutes )
also , be aware that the quoted times for both replay and tivo are for lowest quality recording
you will probably find that the lowest quality is too low and that you will want to use the next best quality , probably halving the available record time
in short , replay should spending their energy on getting existing products to work reliably , and on supporting features they promised a year ago , rather than introducing new products .
first , the good news : * no question : this is the future
i am not a tv guy ( watch maybe <NUM> hours/month ) , yet already i have found myself skipping through commercials , creating a telletubbies theme for my daughter , and discovering ( good ) shows that i'd have missd otherwise
* the company is clearly committed to its customers
i have had to call customer support ; the folks were friendly and helpful
the and user interface are clearly improving , and the program guide is easy to use
* as always ,
is a great place to buy this-- great price , and delivery
now for the rest of the story
* is simple enough
if you are comfortable with , say , setting up a fax machine
* usability is very good , but not quite excellent
i frequently find myself trying to remember the difference between "guide" and "menu , " or "input" and ( or just buy a wireless jack here
) in all , this is a great "version 2" product , where version <NUM> will be truly excellent
i highly , highly recommend it
but know that the next generation will smooth out those last few rough edges
live a little and buy it now ( really ! )
it is fun to be a bit ahead of the curve .
i bought a replaytv before christmas but found that my old tv and video didn not have the right connectors to go with it
the replaytv manual told me how i could work around this problem , but it looked like the workaround would give me poorer picture and sound quality , so i sadly decided to return the replaytv and wait until i get a new tv
if you own an ancient tv and video , think twice about trying out the replay
and , if you are about to buy a new tv , make sure you get one with to ensure best performance with new gadgets like the replay
having said that , amazon is service was so good and its returns department so helpful , that it was no hassle to try the machine out and then return it
if you are unsure about buying one , the return policy certainly makes it painless to check the system out
even though i didn not get to use the replay , i was impressed by the manual ( i am a documentation writer myself ) and the easy setup guide .
tivo is the greatest ! i was skeptical at first , not even being a huge television watcher myself and now- just try to take my tivo away ! the things i love about tivo are- *ease of use- you can record programs at the touch of a button on the tivo remote , there are no tapes , crouching on the floor in front of the tv- difficult settings , etc
it literally takes a few seconds to set the tivo to record an entire season worth of shows with the iseason pass' feature
*maximizing your viewing time- i record the shows i like to watch when i have the time to watch them
that means no more coming home and surfing channels and settling on something
i get to watch my favorite shows when i have time to watch them
i can also zip right through commercials with the fast forward button
*the tv guide is another great feature- you can always find out what will be on or when a show will be over without messing around trying to find the tv guide
*unlike a vcr you can watch things you have previously recorded while recording another show ! i set the tivo up myself and the actual hardware took me about <NUM> minutes
tivo comes with every possible connector you could need , i think- so there was no running to radio shack to pick up a coax cable or what have you
i had no problems programming the remote to my television or making the call , etc
it was very easy to do
i highly recommend this product
it is well worth the price .
in the past twenty years i have purchased thousands of dollars worth of a/v and pc equipment
at $399 plus $10 per month for the programming , tivo is my favorite
ok , if i want to spend hours every week programming my vcr ( of which i own five ) , i can record all my favorite shows , but why bother when tivo does a much better job virtually automatically
since i purchased tivo in april , i haven not recorded anything on the vcr is
i still use them occasionally to play a rental movie not available on dvd
for those of you that may complain about the $10/month ( or $200 one time ) charge for the programming data service , i would suggest that this is a minor cost compared to what you are probably paying for cable or direct tv , and i would submit that the tivo service will greatly enhance your ability to utilize and manage the <NUM> to <NUM> channels that are available with cable or satellite
do i watch alot more tv than i did before ? not really , but now i always have something to watch that i am interested in rather than just watching what happens to be currently broadcasted
did i consider replay ? yes , also a nice product , but for my needs tivo is better
will the price drop by christmas ? probably , but at $399 why wait ? enjoy it today .
i received a great birthday present in 2000 ; the tivo
i can honestly say it is changed the way i view television ( however corny their ad slogan is )
i set up my tivo in late september , and i haven not looked back since
the setup took an extraordinary amount of time ( at least <NUM> hours ) , but once i got rolling , everything else was pretty easy
i can not tell you how much i enjoy taking my time to do things instead of rushing home to catch my favorite program
i don not have to worry , because tivo is got me covered
not only has the tivo recorded programs i like to watch , but it recommends show that i might watch ( though the use of the thumbs down recommendations i give to specific shows ) , and i can say that some of the recommendations they have given have hit the nail right on the head
the recommendations can be a little weird though
i mean , i am a guy who likes the simpsons , but does that mean i will like rugrats as well ? this is not a perfect unit , though
drawbacks include missing recording cues ( although not entirely tivo is fault , but you'd think some networks would get on the ball here and standardize when they start and stop a show )
you wouldn not know how many times i have said &quot ; oh , the recording started late again , &quot ; or &quot ; why did you cut off the ending ? ! ? ! ? &quot ; also the unit , in a quiet room , can be a little noisy
when i am watching a show late at night , i can hear the unit is hard drive churning
maybe i am nitpicking , but i thought you would like to know
another drawback is the inability to totally skip over commercials
you can fast forward , sure
you have to be good at timing the fast forward right so that when you hit play , you will catch the show just after commercial
yes , the product has drawbacks , but i can look past that for now and say that this product is amazing
in a couple of years my tune might change , but for now , make mine tivo !
i wasn not sure whether to give this philips tivo zero stars or five stars
zero stars because the quality stinks
five stars because it is such an amazing product
on the negative side , the modem on my tivo went dead in just six months
after reading all the amazon reviews , it appears that this is a very common problem that can not be ignored
it wouldn not be so bad if the warranty weren not so short and if philips/tivo support weren not so completely incompetent
it is now been five weeks and they still haven not returned my tivo -- even though i had to pay for them to fix it ! i am told the delay is because they ran out of refurbished units to send me
i don not find that an acceptable excuse
since i still believe that tivo is the most amazing invention since the personal computer , i still definitely recommend you buy one
besides , it is not tivo , but philips that seems to have the quality problem ( i am not sure how the sony versions rate on quality )
but there are some steps you should take if you buy one : first , buy the extended warranty plan that most stores offer
you will pay extra , but it will still be less then paying $100 for philips to fix it
and store warranties last <NUM> years , unlike the awful <NUM> months labor , <NUM> year parts warranty that you get from philips
second , buy a special power strip that includes inputs for cable and telephone lines
this will stop any power surges from hitting your tivo , which is what i suspect is causing a lot of these failures
( my tivo died after during a mild thunderstorm
) good luck !
i have a cable system that has an switch
tivo does not support this
their solution is to decide between using tivo on &quot ; a&quot ; or &quot ; b&quot ;
and when i wanted to switch , it took a <NUM> hour set up
also , if your system requires a cable box you probably wont be able to watch another channel while tivo is recording
( you would need another cable box or cable tuner of some sort )
are you like me and tired of watching <NUM> minutes of commercials every hour--then you will love this product
how valuable is your time ? how much time do you waste watching commercials ? if you could cut that out , what could you do with that extra time ? hit pause and whatever you are watching is digitally recorded
go make a sandwich and pick up where you left off , jump ahead of commercials
this unit is smart
want instant replay ? it is got it
want to preselect programs to watch ? it can
want to give a program thumbs down and have it remember you don not like it
it can
want <NUM> hours of record capabilty--it has it
buy this recorder
you will never regret it
it will change the way you watch tv
it makes vcr is look prehistoric .
there are plenty of gadgets that give the impression that it is great- but once the initial excitement wears off you realize it didn not live up to what you expected
do you have pieces of junk in your closet that you had high hopes for ? rest assured tivo is not one of those
tivo really does change the way you watch tv
not only can you pause &quot ; live&quot ; tv ( a feature that has to be used to be appreciated ) , but you can replay and live too ! no more &quot ; what did he say ? &quot ; or &quot ; did i just see that ?
with a simple push of one button you can jump back <NUM> seconds , and keep jumping back <NUM> seconds with multiple button pushes
and who doesn not love to skip the commercials ? ! best of all , for many tivo users the concept of &quot ; live tv&quot ; simply disappears
tivo is , after all , a recording device
if you want to watch programs when it is convenient for you , it is as simple as keying in a few letters to find the show , and select &quot ; record this show&quot ;
best of all , you can also choose a &quot ; season pass&quot ; , which records that show every time it is on that channel
no more missed episodes , no more forgetting to watch
it is a very and easy to use device- even someone who has a vcr with a blinking &quot ; 12 : 00&quot ; will be watching every show they love
update : tivo has added a &quot ; wish list&quot ; that will allow you to put in favorite actors' names , keywords or whatever you like so tivo can automatically record these personal favs
i put in &quot ; beatles&quot ; , so now every program description that mentions the fab four automatically gets recorded for me
brilliant ! video quality ranges from ( &quot ; basic&quot ; ) to nearly impossible to tell from the original ( &quot ; best&quot ; ) plus two levels in the middle
i was worried with the claims that tivo &quot ; degrades&quot ; the picture quality of recorded and live tv because of the mpeg compression , but i found that the &quot ; best&quot ; quality is nearly perfect , and &quot ; high&quot ; quality is very acceptable
this videophile has no problems with what tivo does to the signal
one of the coolest features of tivo is its ability to learn what you like and don not like
using the &quot ; thumbs up&quot ; and &quot ; thumbs down&quot ; buttons on the remote , your personal tv player will be able to give you suggestions on things you might have missed or didn not know you would like
if there is room on the hard drive it will even record things it thinks you might like , but only if you tell tivo you want this feature
i have found a few movies that i had never heard of that were actually pretty good
speaking of the remote , the philips tivo remote can also operate your tv and stereo receiver , and it is one of the best remotes i have ever had the pleasure to use
so why didn not i give tivo a perfect <NUM> stars ? i subtracted a star because , with a device like this , there is always room for improvement
setup takes an agonizingly long time , especially if you have a lot of channels on your cable or satellite
the current version of software does not allow you to add &quot ; handles&quot ; to your recording , so it is not uncommon to miss the final minute of a show or movie
( update : this and other great features have been added as a software update , so my review went from <NUM> to <NUM> stars
) if the network doesn not start at the top or bottom of the hour the recording can be less reliable , and if something like sports run over causes a time shift you are out of luck for that recording
it is still much much better than vhs recording , of course
one thing to keep in mind is the claims of &quot ; 14 hour&quot ; and &quot ; 30 hour&quot ; tivos are a little misleading- those times refer to &quot ; basic&quot ; quality
if you care about picture quality , you will be recording at the &quot ; high&quot ; and &quot ; best&quot ; video level which can bring a <NUM> hour unit down to <NUM> hours , and a <NUM> hour unit down to around <NUM> hours
record a couple movies at &quot ; best&quot ; and you will start to see the hard drive space disappear
my advice : go for the &quot ; 30 hour&quot ; if you can afford it
once you discover all the great shows you have been missing because they aren not on when you can watch them , you will need every bit of hard drive space
another thing to remember is that , in order to utilize your tivo to it is fullest potential , you will need to plug it into a phone line and subscribe to tivo is $9
95 a month service
but let me say that the service it worth it ! for that monthly fee they update the show listings every day and will even update the unit is software when they add new features
and tivo is customer support is 2nd to none
final word : tivo is a brilliant device that , once you try it out in your own home , you will never want to be without
if you value your time and enjoy tv , this fun and friendly little device will become your best friend .
i have owned my tivo for a month now and couldn not imagine not having it ! i have completely stopped using my vcrs to record tv
in the past month , i have change my cable service over to digital and reconfiguring the tivo system was a snap
this is the best electronics purchase i have ever made .
i bought it
i sent it back
the equipment is not completely reliable yet
i had the system freeze up twice
i became slow and unresponsive to commands on other occasions
( consumer reports said they had problems with system crashes on two units
) despite the potential unreliability of hard disks and the cost of the system , no extended warranty protection is available if you buy online ( some brick and mortar retailers do offer them indepdently of philips )
you have two people to deal with if there is a problem : philips and tivo and they both kept pointing fingers at each other and claiming it is they other guy is problem
hold times were tolerable when i first got the unit but had become excessive by the time i sent it back
the tv listings are not up to date -- despite the fact that new program data are downloaded daily
i also encounter occasional errors in their listings
the software still needs work
the system got better at picking programs for me at first but as i entered still more thumbs up/thumbs down data i got more garbage
the program is artificial stupidity - not artificial intelligence
i gave thumbs up to &quot ; singing in the rain&quot ; and started getting everything debbie reynolds was ever in
the season pass also needs work
it is ok for broadcast networks
but if i want a season pass for homicide : life on the streets on court tv , it records the same episode four times each day ( same thing on any cable channel that repeats broadcasts of particular programs )
even if you are not waiting for the price to come down , my advice is wait for them to get it right
the current version should be labelled a &quot ; beta&quot ; version .
tivo is claim that they will change the way you watch tv is completely true
being able to pause or replay whatever you are currently watching to grab a snack , answer a call , etc
is great
you can not imagine how helpful it is to have almost two weeks of programming information available to pick and chose what to record for the next few days
i'd recommend the 30hr unit over the 14hr if you can afford it
after you start searching the two week guide by program name , channel name , favorite channels , or by time of day you will quickly find plenty of things you want to record
directv viewers will especially find this useful
it makes all those channels much more manageable , and i prefer the tivo guide to the one my dss box provided
all of the tivo menus are well thought out , attractive , and *very* easy to use
they include lots of cables - including , a phone jack splitter ( nice touch ) , and other goodies so almost anyone will find everything they need to hook tivo up right out of the box
the user is guide is helpful too , for people who are a little less sure of themselves around stuff like this
i picked tivo over replaytv because of their close alliance with directv ( directv has invested in them ) , and from reading other people is comments in newsgroups and other forums
after i spent about half an hour going through the program guide and giving various programs nothumbs up' or nothumbs down' ratings ( one of the cooler features of tivo ) , it came up with a whole bunch of other programs it suggested i might like
i am probably sounding like a company spokesperson , but i am not , i am just a *very* happy new user of tivo !
i started out about a year or so ago with a <NUM> hour tivo unit and loved it
the problem was they lie about capacity
sort of
<NUM> hours or in the case of the <NUM> hour unit are really more like <NUM> hours and <NUM> hours with the recorder set to record at best quality
anything lower and the picture looks bad
i then paid tivo to send me a new unit that had been upgraded to <NUM> hours
then that was still not enough time with the system set at best quality
i finally found out i could upgrade the thing myself
so my recomendation is to get the cheapest on that you can and upgrade it
this voids you tivo warrenty but hey we all like to live on the edge right : ) i now have a <NUM> hour tivo because the company i used to upgrade my tivo ( [
] ) added an 80gb disk and now instead of having to delete my recordings early or being more picky about what i record i can go nuts and record anything and everything
i even saw on one website ( [
] ) a guy who has a 151+ hour tivo
another good website for tivo upgrade information is [
] they have parts for sale and directions on how to upgrade your tivo ( the easiest is a <NUM> hour unit since you just add a &quot ; blessed&quot ; drive ) happy tivoing and hack away ! ps if you can not tell i love this thing !
i ordered and received my <NUM> hour tivo from amazon
com last week
i have a home theatre system , with all components ( cd , dvd , phono , digital cable box , &amp ; vcr ) connected through a yamaha a/v receiver
as none of the example in the tivo manual remotely matched mine , and despite the fact that normally i am pretty good at this type of thing , after about three hours of complete failure , i was positively stumped
i finally had to call tivo is customer care support
and this is where i am so very impressed ! i was absolutely blown away when the tivo representative stayed on the phone for over an hour with me as i crawled behind my entertainment center with a flashlight and my cordless phone , with various cables in my teeth ! ; - ) she walked me through every step and with persistence and effort on both our parts , finally we got everything hooked up and &quot ; talking to&quot ; each other
i have never experienced customer service like this before on anything i have ever bought
amazing ! and as for the tivo and how it is working now - great and i love it ! only thing i didn not like was the fact tivo/philips have truly overlooked the customer is with home entertainment systems , calling a set up like mine , &quot ; advanced&quot ; - from what i can tell more and more consumers are going to the &quot ; advanced&quot ; systems so it would be good to see tivo include hookup examples for &quot ; advanced&quot ; systems in their future product manuals .
i agree with all of the glowing reviews here on amazon
this product has changed my television watching habits forever
having only owned this model for a few weeks , i am already amazed at the change--now i can watch what i want to watch when i want to watch it and i never have to deal with programming a vcr again--in fact , i unhooked my vcr from my system ! amendment to this review : 8/29/01my tivo automatically downloaded and installed its newest software , making a great product even better , if you can imagine
my favorite new feature is the ability to have your tivo search out and record pograms by a very sophisticated set of search criteria
amazing !
i agree with the previous person posting
tivo is great , but the customer service experience was awful ! tivo tried to handle the problem by not letting us talk with phillips directly
claimed they lost the unit , lost the credit card , credit card was expired ( it wasn not ) , etc
it was like the 'dog ate my homework' excuse everytime and then they said it was <NUM> hrs before they could get us an update
<NUM> months later , we finally had our unit back friday , but by sunday the tivo service shutdown because the serial number was unknown to the computer
had to wait until monday to fix it ! buy sony instead .
after running a phone line behind my stereo cabinet ( which i could luckily do myself ) , i connected my tivo to my vcr , stereo and cable box in about <NUM> minutes
when i powered on the unit , it took me a few seconds to realize that my vcr input needed to be set to &quot ; line&quot ; before i could see the tivo screens
the guided setup procedure went without a hitch ; the most difficult and part was determining the remote control codes to allow the tivo remote to turn on both my tv and stereo system at the same time
i also had a few false starts configuring the system to control my cable box
the first time tivo dialed into the main computer , the actual connection lasted only about <NUM> minutes , but tivo busily sorted and indexed the downloaded information for about <NUM> 1/2 hours
the system is so quiet , that if it weren not for the green light on the front , i'd have no idea it was even powered on
the software and the screens are well designed and very user friendly
i have friend who can barely change the channels on his tv using a remote control , and he was easily able to navigate the system and program it to record his favorite shows ( i have been giving demos to all of my friends )
the system can automatically update its own software every day , so i imagine there are many more features coming soon
everyone i show tivo to has some great suggestions for improvements , and i hope to see some of them in future versions
to summarize in <NUM> words : buy it
i admit i was skeptical at first , but i am a <PERCENT> tivo fan now .
this is a very useful product for people who watch a lot of television
the tivo is a simple product to use once you figure it out
it can record a whole season of a series or just one show which is very useful
now the down side to it
when they say <NUM> or <NUM> hrs they are not telling the total truth
the number of hours of recording which are stated are for terrible quality recording
for the <NUM> hr phillips tivo recorder , which i have , the good quality recording is only <NUM> hrs which is dramatically different
and another defect that annoys you sometimes is the mistakes of changing channels that it does sometimes
for example if i want channel <NUM> recorded for a little time it will change to channel <NUM> or <NUM> because the frequency isn not set perfectly on the cable box
this is an annoying part of the tivo
if there was an adjuster then that would be perfect
but again it is the time which really matters , tivo fools the customers into thinking they will have <NUM> hrs of perfect recording which is not true , but the settings of quality can be changed to multiple levels which increases the time available depending on the level
i hope you find this review helpful .
this is a great , revolutionary product
it is pretty much as great as everybody says
i have had mine for a couple of months now and have no major complaints
however , in case tivo is reading , all my ( minor ) complaints follow : tivo comes with all kinds of hardware
everything except a coax splitter which you need to buy if you want to continue using the tuner on your tv
( which i think would be just about everybody because you have to do this if you want to watch live tv while tivo is recording )
the season pass records all showings of a particular show no matter when or what channel it is on
however if you pick a show that is in syndication or a cable show that is repeated often , you will get many more than you actually want
it'd be better if a season pass was only good for one channel and time period
also be nice if it were smart enough to not record additional showings of the same episode
another bad thing about this is that it will not allow you to create other seasons passes if it thinks it interferes with the first one
( like say you only want a seinfeld season pass for a 4pm showing but seinfeld also runs at 9pm on some other channel ; i can not set up a season pass for some other 9pm show without disrupting the first )
of course the way around this is to record by time but i think some improvements can be made
when watching live tv , it keeps the last <NUM> minutes unless you switch channels or a new show starts
this means that if i stop watching ( without pausing ) near the end of a show and a new show starts in the meantime , i will have lost the ability to go back and watch the end of the show i was watching
i don not see why they blow away the last <NUM> minutes when a new show starts , particularly if it is on the same channel
as other people mentioned , it'd have been nice to have a feature so you could skip forward in increments of <NUM> seconds or something
it'd be nice to have a menu option to have a less conspicuous play bar ( or to put it at the top of the screen instead of the bottom )
it covers up things like who wants to be a millionaire questions until it times out and disappears
sometimes the sound loses its top frequencies such that it sounds like a bad speaker
s sounds sound like static
this might be a function of the broadcast but live tv doesn not sound that way
it'd be great to have a vhs record list feature so you could record multiple programs to videotape all in one go
sometimes i make tapes for my overseas friends and having to record one 1/2 hour program at a time is a pain in the rear
when scrolling through program listings , it makes you wait a second before bringing up the next screen
it should be each screen in advance so it doesn not have to waste this kind of time
due to program scheduling , many times it will miss the last <NUM> seconds or so of a broadcast ( so you might miss that last joke while the credits are scrolling )
it should give you an option where it will always record a couple of minutes before/after a program ( if there isn not another program scheduled to be recorded immediately afterwards )
i guess that is about it
don not let all this scare you away
it is an awesome product and now that i have it , i wouldn not watch tv any other way .
i am amazed that more people don not own this product
tivo is the next thing after the vcr , once it catches on everyone will want it
basically tivo is a really smart vcr
you watch tv and use the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons on the remote to tell tivo what shows you like and don not like
tivo uses these suggestions and an internal tv guide that it downloads everyday to figure out what shows you might like to watch
tivo uses all this info to determine shows that you might like and records them
tivo also has features to manually record and a season pass feature
the season pass is a feature where you tell tivo the name of a show and then tivo automatically records this show anytime it is on
tivo is always on 24/7 so it never misses a show
beyond these features tivo also lets you pause live tv , do instant replays of live tv and a ton of other features .
wow , i wrote this almost <NUM> years ago and i still love tivo , but have graduated to two hd models
i have used several dvrs rented by my cable company and they don not hold a candle to tivo ; the only advantage is they are a little less expensive
but you get what you pay for
i still say : get a tivo ! there is not much one can add to <NUM> other reviews about tivo
all i can say is , if you don not have one , you don not know what you are missing
deciding whether or not to buy a personal tv recorder , which is what they are called , is a "
" buy one ! the only decision is whether to buy tivo ( versons sold by phillips and sony ) or replaytv ( sold by panasonic )
both systems require that they call in by local telephone call each night to download program information about the channels you receive locally , either by cable , satellite ( dish/directv ) or antenna , and both charge for that service
replaytv sells for about $200 more than tivo , because the replaytv subscription charge is included in the purchase price
tivo sells for about $200 less , but you must buy the subscription
the total cost is essentially the same
one advantage to tivo , that replaytv doesn not offer , is that you can also elect to subscribe to tivo by the month ( $10 ) or year ( $100 ) if you don not want to shell out up front the $200 for the subscription
replaytv subscriptions are for machine life only
both lifetime subscriptions are tranferable to new owners , so you can sell it or give it to your kids when the next ptvr generation comes along
each consumer will have to make up his or her own mind about which system to buy , but i urge you not be misled by explanations saying replaytv subscriptions are "free , " and tivo subscriptions are more costly
not true
no matter which ptvr you get , your tv life will never be the same
you will wonder how you survived without !
i hesitated before buying a tivo , because i wasn not sure if it was the best option for me
now i can not believe that i ever lived without it ! i have only had it for a month , but now whenever i watch tv somewhere without tivo , i get so frustrated because i can not pause , rewind , have an instant replay , etc
i can not imagine living without the tivo-- i hardly ever use my vcr anymore
setting up the tivo is not as easy as they make it out to be -- if you have cable box you may have to spend countless hours fiddling around behind your tv before you can get the tivo to work , because it is meant to work with either direct tv or a satellite
nevertheless , it does work with almost all tvs and , and after you first get it all set up , it is effortless to use
the interactive menu is intuitive and , so you will be setting up season passes to record your favorite shows as soon as you start
you can search for shows to record by time , channel , name or genre , and you can get a &quot ; season pass&quot ; in order to record the show whenever it is on
i love always having a selection of shows i like ready for me to watch , instead of having to channel surf endlessly to find something
though there may not be a full <NUM> hours of recording time on the tivo ( 30 hours is only with &quot ; basic&quot ; quality picture-- and best quality you can only record <NUM> hours ) , i still find that i always have extra room left over to record my favorite shows
i have actually found that i don not watch more tv now that i have the tivo , i just watch tv shows that i actually like , at times when i am available
i get more homework done now ( no joke )
if there is extra room available , the tivo actually records tv shows that it &quot ; thinks&quot ; that you would like , since you are able to rate tv shows and movies , it can choose similar ones that you might enjoy
for example , if you give &quot ; friends&quot ; <NUM> thumbs up , it may record &quot ; seinfeld&quot ; for you if you have extra room
if you don not want the shows it it records , you can simply delete them or give them a &quot ; thumbs down&quot ; rating
the more shows you rate , the better tivo understands your personal tastes
the only thing i wish it could do is record on one channel while i watch another , but it is understandable that it cannot
also , tivo comes up with &quot ; updates&quot ; now and again to improve on its features , so if something isn not perfect now , it may be improved in the future
for example , some reviewers complained that while recording sports , tivo would fail to record if the game went into overtime , but now tivo has a feature which lets you &quot ; cushion&quot ; your recordings by however much time you want , to ensure that you don not miss anything
one of the best features by far is a the &quot ; live tv guide&quot ; -- if you just press the &quot ; live tv guide&quot ; button while watching tv , a menu pops up on top of the screen giving the name of the show or movie , a brief plot summary , who the actors are , when it started , when it ends and what is on after it
watching tv was never so easy
whenever i show my friends how tivo works , they are amazed by how we can pause , go get a drink or go to the bathroom , then come back and fast forward through all the commercials
you will also never have to say &quot ; wait ! what happened ? i missed it ! &quot ; because you can simply rewind backwards in the program and watch it again
i know that i am gushing about this , but tivo seriosly has changed the way i watch tv-- as many other reviewers have said , tivo lets you control your tv , not the other way around
i think that i will be using it for a long , long time from now , and i have no regrets about buying it .
i am an early adopter of tivo and it has completely changed the way that i watch tv
i am glad that people are finally catching on to what i have been saying for over a year which is : tivo is the coolest thing ever
the main thing that i hear from people when i try to explain the benefits of owning a tivo is &quot ; but i have a vcr - why would i want this ? &quot ; i have put together a brief list of the benefits of owning a tivo for you
i , too , own a vcr
and with all the good intentions in the world of taping programs that i wanted to see - i never did
aren not you sick of missing your favorite tv shows ? with tivo you will never miss your favorite shows again - in addition , my little tivo friend may help you find new favorite shows
don not you hate commercials as much as the next guy ? with tivo , you will never be forced to sit through another minute of those crappy commercials
you will not even know what people are talking about as they discuss the new bud commercial
you will merely shake your head and know that those poor , unfortunate souls don not have a tivo at home
don not you ever have to go to the bathroom in the middle of watching something ? i won not elaborate on that one - but wouldn not it be nice to pause your tv to jump up and answer the phone , grab a snack , etc
without having to worry about what you are going to miss
you will rent less movies
which also means that you will save more money
forget renting
just pay for the premium channels that you were always to cheap to pay for before because you figured that you'd never watch that many movies
now you can watch them all
so , to sum up my little tivo review - i have to say that you will completely streamline the way you watch tv when you get a tivo
stop torturing yourself with the network is schedule that doesn not fit your schedule and make up your own
with tivo there is always something good on
what you want to watch .
i bought tivo in early 2000
i love it , but the unit has hadit is share of problems
the warranty is only <NUM> days ! my unit had problems with the ir receiver in the unit not receiving the commands
( yes , it was the ir receiver as i have two remotes and neither worked unless you were inches from the unit )
it was over <NUM> days , but i had called several times on this issue and finally got them to exchange it without charging me
but they do not ship the new unit until they receive the old unit
i sent that to texas
and received a new one within a week
the second unit was what they called doa ( dead on arrival )
it didn not work either
( it says refurbished on the bottom )
so now i am sending it back at another shipping cost
another issue is that this receiver 'learns' programs , actors , directors , etc
that you like
so , with each exchange , i lose all of the info it has learned
all of this will lead me to send a letter to the president of philips , but even getting his name took two calls
when i explained why i wanted his name to the person who answered in new york city she hung up on me .
if you want to save significant time watching tv and want to watch a variety of shows when you want to , this is the product to get
the &quot ; pause&quot ; feature is very handy , but the big seller is the season pass ( below )
if you have to put your child in bed , you don not have to miss a part of your show -- just hit pause and then play when you come back
same for the telephone or when mother nature calls
this is a great stress reducer ! season passes are even better
no more fussing with tapes and figuring out which has what show on it ( not to mention that it would take 10+ tapes to do what we do with tivo )
for example , we set a season pass for &quot ; the west wing&quot ; just once , and now it will record every show that comes up ( you also can choose only new shows instead of reruns )
it will keep track of time changes and day changes
when you come home , you look at now playing and it shows you what shows are available
ours has things like &quot ; the west wing&quot ; , &quot ; er&quot ; , &quot ; boston public&quot ; , &quot ; david letterman&quot ; and &quot ; whose line is it anyway&quot ;
who cares when they were shown live , we can watch when we want to
my wife watches soap operas again
with tapes , she got tired of putting in new tapes , accidentally recording over shows , forgetting to rewind before recording , etc
all of that is history
now the shows come up in the list and she can hit play or delete ( if she has several days worth , she is more inclined to hit delete )
while viewing , she can skip through sections at 3x , 20x or 60x
she typically watches <NUM> minutes in <NUM> minutes or less ( she only cares about one or two story lines in a show )
it will almost certainly change your viewing habits -- for the better
you may watch shows , again , that you used to watch
you are not required to watch crappy shows because that is the only thing on at the moment
more shows , higher quality , less time
that is what makes a great consumer product .
here are thee shortcomings as i have seen them over the past year with tivo : 1 ) it is very sensitive to power surges or little
when the lights blink off in the house , the tivo tends to lock up , and this 'frozen state' can only be reversed by unplugging it for a few secs and then plugging it back in and waiting for it to cycle through its menu ( 2 mins )
2 ) &quot ; pause&quot ; , which is by far the coolest thing about tivo for me ( like &quot ; pizza guy knocks , don not want to miss this next play&quot ; ) , is pretty
after <NUM> mins of pause , it starts playing again
once it starts playing again , you cannot get all the way back to where you paused it
3 ) &quot ; record&quot ; is nice , but nowhere near <NUM> hours at any resolution you could stand to watch
even at the best resolution , the picture is seriously degraded from the original
4 ) i am getting a little tired of the $9
95 per month
i know i agreed to it , but it really seems a little too much , considering i paid for the hardware and the menu ( which is what the $9
95 is supposed to be for ) is no better than what my digital cable provider or dss system provides
overall , i like it , but it should be improved before getting <NUM> stars from anyone .
boy do i love my tivo
i have had my tivo for over a year now and i hate watching live tv
tivo does an excellent job of finding the shows that i am interested in watching and then saves them for me so i can watch them when it is convenient for me
no vcr in the world could do it as easily and quickly as my tivo can
can your vcr search for shows starring a particular actor ? how about movies by a particular director ? can your vcr search the next two weeks of listings for shows that match key words you set up ? no
it can not
vcr is can not compare to tivo
i don not watch more tv
i watch better tv .
i have to say , in general what the unit does and the service is pretty incredible
set up wasn not too difficult ( dish network ) just a bit time consuming
problem is after month the units modem fails to work
it cannot dial into tivo central for programming data
it has been a real frustrating situation - setting up <NUM> units , having my tv majorly distubed after sending back the damaged unit and waiting for a replacement
and the fact that you are so spoiled with this that when you dont have it it drives you crazy ! : - ) im giving up on the phillips unit at least in my case and going to try out a sony unit
perhaps ill have better luck
also have to say the <NUM> minutes on wait for a tivo troubleshooter is a bit irritating to say the least - try doing it <NUM> or more times .
tivo is amazing
i am not much of a tv junkie but tivo has me hooked
like most people i put in a long day at the job
it is so nice to come home and actually have something i like to watch
i am a big twilight zone fan
most &quot ; zones&quot ; air either in the middle of the night or during working hours
i set my tivo up to give me a season pass to the program
when i come home after work there are always at least <NUM> episodes recorded for me to watch
the only problem that i have is that sometimes the audio does not match the video
it is sort of like watching an old godzilla movie
i have to go to the menu and restart the receiver to fix .
after reading about tivo and personal digital recorders in magazine reviews and here , i decided i would take the plunge
i thought hard about getting the phillips <NUM> hour version , but at twice the cost and because i hadn not even tried the concept out , i decided to settle for the phillips <NUM> hour unit
after an easy , but time consuming setup ( best if you do it right before bedtime ) , i quickly realized how cool and useful this thing is
the video quality is fine , decent even at the &quot ; lesser&quot ; levels ( movie credits do get blurry and difficult to read ) , although true videophiles may find it unexceptional
i would have to say the most pleasing aspect of this is that i am now getting the most out of my premium cable movie channels
i am now catching a lot of movies i routinely missed because i was not vigilant enough to find out when they might be on so that i could set my vcr to tape them
now , the &quot ; network showcase&quot ; feature alerts me to all of the channels' current and upcoming flicks and all i have to do is to say &quot ; yea&quot ; or &quot ; nay&quot ; to recording them
even if i don not check ahead , the thing records movies it thinks i might like based upon preferences i have expressed for other features and shows
also , skipping commercials is an easy and pleasurable feature
by the way , any football ( or other live action sports ) enthusiast easily will see the usefulness of such a device
one thing that disturbs me about the tivo phenomena is that i fear that it may be rendered obsolete quickly because of how rapidly technology is evolving
i purchased the lifetime service option and i will be downright bummed if something else comes along to supplant it before i get my money is worth and i wind up having to buy into something else !
honestly , i am pretty critical and particular about products
but i have had my tivo for over a year and haven not watched live tv since getting it
why would i ? with tivo , when i turn on my tv i can choose from among watching programs i know i want to watch
i can jump over commercials
i can instant replay something i have missed
tivo even learns what i like and suggests other programs i'd probably enjoy
all while keeping my data confidential
i am so keen on the product i have given two as gifts
we have had all sorts of gadgets in my home but none has taken over the way tivo has
my daughters ( 7 and 11 ) and my wife are complete converts
the tivo remote is the default for tv ; we have stopped using our vcr
it is a killer product
next stop ? i am going to buy some tivo stock ! travis
the philips tivo hdr312 personal tv receiver is a must have ! for a first generation product it works extremely well
pause live tv to go to make a snack or let the dog out and when you return you can watch the entire show right where you left off and not miss a thing since its still recording what is airing live
the season pass feature makes recording the shows simple and head ache free
don not worry about the networks moving shows around since tivo will automatically find the change and still record them for you
tivo learns your favorites shows by your rating of them and will record shows based on the profile it builds on you
don not worry , this is all done in the box and the information is not sent to tivo
so your likes and dislikes remain private
tivo is very simple to hook up to your tv and telephone line
it normally takes less than <NUM> minutes to hook up
you will have to program it upon the first use which will require a hour call to a number
you can leave tivo unattended once it starts
there after tivo will call a local or number to update its listings and content daily
in my experience tivo is customer care is very good if your tivo should develop a problem .
you are life will never be the same with tivo
i didn not convert until my two brothers kept recommending this product
now you can watch and record tivo shows at the same time
if you miss the beginning/end - it doesn not matter - you can slew to whatever point in the recorded program
sounds inconsequential , but it isn not when you have missed the beginning of the nightly news , that all so important soap opera , or whatever your fancy
one of the best features is the fast forward/rewind scan - once you hit play , it plays back at the last visual pause/transition , starting you at your program
the unit starts 'learning' your tv preferences by content ; there is also a personal voting scale so the unit can start learning and recording on downtimes
this is great for reruns - but becomes troublesome to delete constantly if you record at high quality resolution or have a ton of shows lined up
also , there a iseason pass' that essentially records the specified show whenever it appears in the tv lineup ; this is a problem if you'd like to override just one of the shows for an alternate specific show
you will just have to revert back to manual setting of time/date recording
oh , the setting of time/day recording like vcrs is over , you can search and select by show name , search by type of subject matter ( drama , news , etc )
the term 'product' is misleading - this machine is a computer with one/two hardrives , a modem that allows for updates , all the current input options ( satellite , , rca ) and comes with all the cables you will need and more
the eye semantics on the front facia is a bit ominous , but true to its function
) get a unit with one harddrive if you have got the choice
research a bit and you will see why if you are a hacker
the folks who designed and put all this together should get some sort of award .
i have had my tivo for about <NUM> weeks , and i am very glad i bought it
it took alot to convince my girlfriend that it was a smart purchase , but when she realized how easy it was to record her favorite shows , she agreed with me
no more fumbling for video tapes or botched vcr programming
i sort of wish it had more capacity
<NUM> hours means that things are deleted sometimes before we have a chance to watch them
also , the video quality does get a little funky when you save everything in basic mode ( max
compression ) , but it is certainly not unwatchable
( i know a <NUM> hour unit is available , but i couldn not justify spending the extra $400 for it
i hope phillips offers some kind of upgrade path for the system ! ) by far , the coolest feature of the system is the auto mode , where tivo learns what you like and don not like based on the programs you have chosen to record or given your approval on
it is always interesting to see what it comes up with
i have a few minor complaints , mostly simple design flaws
while the idea is cool that you can get a &quot ; season pass&quot ; which means that tivo will record every episode of a particular program , regardless of which channel it is on , it would be good if you had the opportunity to limit the scope of the season pass
say , for example , you want to get a season pass to the simpsons , but you are more interested in the newer episodes on fox on sunday night , and not the older ones in syndication
the way the device works now , a season pass gets you all of them
within a few days , your tivo will be full of all of the episodes you can stomach , leaving no room for other programs
on the other hand , if you choose a season pass to antiques roadshow , you will get the pbs and the bbc versions , so there is definitely a benefit to having it work the way it does
to the designer is credit , tivo won not save the same episode of a tv program twice at any given time , however , this only works based on the tv guide descriptions -- if a program is entered with &quot ; no description available , &quot ; tivo will tape duplicate episodes over and over again
another minor complaint is that trying to switch channels through the tivo in &quot ; watch live tv&quot ; mode is a little clumsy
there is a noticable lag while the tivo tells the directtv box to switch the channel
i also prefer directtv is program guide to the tivo is
these complaints aside , i am very happy with the machine , and i am very glad i bought it
now , i never channel surf -- there is always something good to watch
something i want to watch
i don not know how i got along without it .
i bought tivo from amazon
com , saving myself the sales tax
when i got it , i carefully read the instructions , finding out that you couldn not use it with a digital pbx phone system , but analog would be fine
when i hooked it up , it didn not connect
i called customer support multiple times , but they never returned my call when they promised
at one time , i was on hold for <NUM> min
one representitive told me to send it back to amazon
com , when the unit was not defective
i had to buy another one , when it had the exact same problem , for a grand total of <NUM> tivos
another rep said to go to radio shack and buy a wireless phone jack , which didn not work either
they cost me more than they are worth
i ended up sending the other one back too
the unit is really well designed , but if i were going to buy one , i would wait until there are more competitiors
it is still to early to buy one .
that i don not know where to begin
the ui is very well designed
it is obvious and intuitive how to navigate the menus
my only complaint is that i sometimes they err towards providing too many navigation and confirmation screens
while this makes each screen less intimidating , it does make navigation a bit more tedious
but this is really a minor complaint in an , overall , brilliantly designed interface
the features are explained well enough in the amazon comparison guide and elsewhere
i will just say that they work as advertised and are extremely cool ! tv serves my schedule instead of the opposite
the quality in the best mode ( the one used for viewing and pausing live tv ) is nearly indistinguishable from the source
if you have a really big screen and high end audio equipment you may notice the difference
i find it fine for general tv viewing though i do bypass it for ppv movies
i generally use the medium ( second lowest out of four ) quality setting when recording
it is a lot better than vhs but is a noticable dropoff from the original
my biggest complaint is the box is sluggishness in changing channels and responding to user commands
it takes about a second to change channels and , sometimes , several seconds to go between menu/guide screens
there are two misperceptions i constantly see in user and professional reviews regarding tivo vs
first , replaytv is service isn not really free
they just build it into the base cost of the unit
when factoring in lifetime service from tivo , the prices have remained comparable between the two products
tivo was a cheaper when the products were first introduced and now replaytv is cheaper
but they are in the same ballpark
the second misconception regards tivo is automatic suggestions that are based on user preferences
where is the negative in this ? if you don not like it you can turn it off and it will never record anything you don not explicitely ask it to record
but what is the harm ? if there is extra space on the drive why not use it ? it will never take space away from the programs you have asked it to record
it is hard enough to sift through and find quality programming to watch
i will take any suggestions i can get
the biggest problem with tv is too little quality programming at the time i want to watch
the box is just trying to fill itself with stuff i might want to watch
and sometimes it works
the other day i came home and tivo had recorded the truman show
this is a movie i like but wouldn not have thought to mark for recording
it was nice to have a good movie waiting for me when i wanted to watch it
every time i turn on the tv it is like i have a little surprise waiting for me when i check what the tivo is recorded for me
i like the serendipity of channel surfing - of finding something i wasn not expecting
that is why i like the tivo is suggestions in addition to it allowing me to specify exactly what i want to record
i haven not used a replaytv
it is probably an excellent product , too , but the number of technical complaints is troubling
tivo seems to have a higher satisfaction/lower complaint ratio
and tivo is usage model is more to my liking .
don not think of it as a vcr , think of it as a personal broadcast network that only broadcasts the shows you like , only when you want , and without commercials
i have had one since june and it is rendered every other tv in the house obsolete
with tivo is current $50 off recommendation from existing tivo owners through november , it is an especially good bargain .
any tivo is a huge improvement over regular television
this unit can easily be upgraded for more capacity
i added an additional <NUM> gig drive without a hitch
pausing live television is great
i haven not used my vcr in over a year
tapes are a joke in comparison
easy onscreen menus guide the set up of recording preferences
the season pass feature will record every episode for you !
ok , so it sounds like a digital vcr with a few bells and whistles , and very limited capacity
but that true random access with the ability to switch around has drasticly changed the way i watch tv
even before tivo i tended to tape almost everything i watched
but with tivo this has become so painless that i find myself almost never watching live tv
it is so nice to bounce around between the things i told tivo to record and the things it thinks i'd like to watch
i can watch a piece of this , a bit of that
skip part of this , delete that show i didn not really want to watch
plus with about <NUM> days schedule into the future , i won not miss anything when out of town for a week
only serious flaws are the handling of conflicting season passes and the limited storage ( 10 hours on medium quality )
i expect the software problems to be handled in a free upgrade in the next few months , and the storage to be upgradable in the field at selected stores
i already find it a pain to watch tv without tivo .
dvr is are great
i have <NUM> -- <NUM> replays and a tivo
i highly recommend them over vcr is for all the reasons you read in all the reviews
they also work quite well with few glitches , so i hadn not had much chance to test their tech support , until recently
my tivo unit is not properly contacting the server to download the program directory
this has been going on for over <NUM> weeks , so now my unit won not record at all
tivo support lines have <NUM> min+ waits to get through
online support is very limited
upon getting thru to the first tivo number , finally , they sent me to a second philips number , and they were closed , with limited business hours
it would be one thing if this were just bad hardware support , we are all used to that
however , tivo is charging $12/month for the directory service and to not be willing to even take my call on it is frustrating
i have had no problems with <NUM> replay tv units , which i have owned longer , and would recommend them over tivo
functionally , the units are essentially the same -- tivo is slightly easier to use but replay is slightly more flexible
my next unit will be another replay .
i bought the <NUM> hour tivo about a month ago
now , i can not imagine watching tv without it ! it is so much better than a vcr
there are so many things i loke about tivo : 1
you can start watching a program at the beginning even if tivo is still recording it
the season pass -- select a program once and it records it every time it is on the choosen channel
the ability to combine my local channels and the satellite dish channels and see a program guide for all of them
now showing -- it is great choosing from a list of recorded programs instead of trying to find the spot on the tape where a program begins
if you are watching something that you haven not asked tivo to record , it still records the most recent <NUM> minutes
so , if you get distracted , you can pick up where you left off
the ability to record based on lots of selection criteria ( show name , channel , time , etc
) someone else wrote that you can not go back to the previous channel
but , the &quot ; enter&quot ; button will take you back
tivo is the best purchase i have made in a long time , and i highly recommend it .
the new &quot ; digital vcr&quot ; is a big step forward for tv
i only watch shows a week , if that
tivo lets me record these reliably , watch them in a very easy manner , and sadly has sucked me into watching even more tv
there are some merits to both tivo and replaytv
but i will say that for anyone who is not technical , tivo is a winner
very clean and easy interface
and , techincal thought i am , i prefer tivo as well
my friends with replaytv agree that their relatives will prefer tivo
i wish amazom had the unit for sale , and i am sure they will , but i have to buy a christmas gift and can not wait
amazon is listed as a unit seller by the tivo website , but amazon customer support doesn not know when it will become available
tivo has promised an upgrade plan for units but the plan is not in place and has no pricing yet
they should correct this , it has been the one sore point in an otherwise exemplary pre and support ssytem
i am sure it is due to the rush to get units into the hands of new customers during the holiday rush
philips has done a great job listening to customers
i think they will continue to improve this unit , most of which can be done with software downloads in the middle of the night
support is very good , and the system works well .
notice : this review relates to tivo , not this specific hardware device
i have a sony directv/tivo combination receiver
my wife and i became addicted to tivo within <NUM> month after installing it
we have gone from watching <PERCENT> live tv/<PERCENT> recorded ( vcr ) to <PERCENT> tivo/<PERCENT> live tv ! we hardly watch anything anymore at its regular time
we simply pull up the &quot ; now playing&quot ; menu , which lists all the shows i have previously recorded , and watch whatever we are in the mood for - drama ( law and order or once and again ) , comedy ( friends , south park ) , reality tv ( survivor , fear factor ) , or sports ( illinois basketball , cliff diving )
there are so many cool things about tivo , but these are my three favorite things : 1 ) season pass , which once you set it up , allows you to record a particular show every time it is on or all shows with a particular actor or subject , 2 ) easy to record ( simply choose the show , not the time and channel ) and easy to find and play ( scroll through &quot ; now playing&quot ; list of prerecorded shows and choose &quot ; select&quot ; to play ) , 3 ) record two shows at once ( like survivor and friends , which both start at 8 : 00 on thursday ) with a directv/tivo combination receiver , which we have
we started with the monthly subscription and moved to the lifetime after just a month ( it is good for the life of the box , not you )
we have a sony model , and i have found sony to always be reliable ( two tvs , one vcr )
i bought a warranty as a safety precaution ( new technology and insurance against the lifetime subscription )
directv customer service is decent , but not great ( they handle the tivo side as well )
the best resource for tivo is the tivo avs forum , which you can link to from the buzz section of the tivo web site
it is a &quot ; must read&quot ; prior to buying this unit
but i am not exaggerating when i say that this is the coolest , most liberating invention to come out since the world wide web
no joke ! you will fall in love with your tivo too .
the philips tivo hdr112 personal tv receiver was super easy to hook up and setup
it takes only <NUM> minutes to make all the necessary connections
it does require a hour set up , which is mostly an automatic download of the channel line up and programming data
tivo will completely change the way you watch tv
it really does learn your likes and dislikes and it will automatically suggest and record shows and movies that it thinks you will enjoy
its really uncanny how it does pick shows and movies i enjoy
you will probably end up never flipping channels looking for something to watch or watch &quot ; live tv&quot ; ever again
just make sure you go for the <NUM> hour model as the <NUM> will fill up very quickly
tivo has been the best first generation product i have ever owned
don not be afraid to take the leap into personal tv as it is really very easy to use and the recording quality is much better than with vcrs .
i bought tivo after seeing the infomercial on directv
i had the satellite and cable subscriptions and was somewhat upset because i was always doing something when a program came on at its scheduled time
now tivo grabs the shows for me and i watch when it is convenient for me
this is a simple to use product
perfect for someone who likes the vcr but hates buying and storing all those tapes
the user interface is easy to grasp
it is a little on the expensive side -- but my free time is valuable too - and this product gives me so much time back
you won not be unhappy that you bought this
wayne schulz
we have been using this for over a year
it was an upgrade from a 10baset hub
the 100basetx feature was a significant improvement for home networking speed
we have three computers on it , one an always on ftp server and this device handles the traffic flawlessly
if you are using internet connection sharing with computers with mixed nics ( some 10baset , some 100baset ) you might see very minor improvements in internet speed on the computers with 10/100 cards , but don not expect this to increase your cable internet speed dramatically
most of the cable networks are 10baset and only an upgrade to 100baset on their part would make a big difference
so when they say you will speed up your internet connection , don not believe it ! we tried a more expensive one a few months ago that promised improved performance - thought it might be better at handling traffic and collisions - but it made no difference
stick with cheap and reliable , and this one fits the bill .
i am an engineer at a post production company
we often have visiting production companies in and out , constantly moving and adding pc is and network printers
there is only one jack in each office , so these little hubs come in handy
so far i have had none fail
the only reason i give it four stars is , as the manual states , when you use the uplink port the adjacent port can not be used as they are interconnected
this usually catches people who just come and plug in and then wonder why they can not get on
other than that , no complaints
a great hub for the money .
i bought two of these hubs and i have connected them at a distance of about <NUM> feet apart
i completely upgraded my <NUM> computer <NUM> mbps system to 10/100 in about 1/2 an hour
also , i upgraded in the middle of the day while the network was running and with little interruption to the workstations or the network
the only trouble i had was my own mistake
i couldn not get two of my computers nic to run at the faster <NUM> mbps speed only to later find that the hubs had automatically sensed that the nic is were <NUM> mbps only
they work like a charm and so does my new fast network .
not sure what all the extra padding is for
the case is huge compared to other <NUM> port 10/100 switches
it works as designed but i wouldnt recommend it over any other 10/100 out there
this has been my secound experience setting up a small home network
the first involved an smc router
the linksys documention and overall user experience ( setup guide , admin screens , and so forth ) put the smc materials to shame-- really it is night and day
both routers seem to work fine ( though the smc unit conked out on me ; i think this was a fluke
) but the linksys' usability wins
highly recommended .
i have used my hub for various applications - cable modem splitting from a router and simple gaming
this hub is perfectly utilitarian for getting the data back and forth with high reliability and unparalleled speed
no problems in either situations over several months of use
though it does say <NUM> ports - if you use this as an uplink from the router , you will obviously only get <NUM> output ports
this is not the case with the gaming issue though
the only minor complaint is the ac resistor power cable
the ac adapter plug is rather easy to yank out of the backside - especially if you are moving cables frequently
other than that , it is worth every cent for high speed fun and efficiency !
this hub is pretty good
a little on the light side , it might slide on the surface a little , but the hub does a nice job at controling the network
this hub is good for linking home computers to a single isp ( dsl or cable ) it will also let you share a dial up account , but your better off using it for some kind of broadband
on the account of being light weight you can use some kind of sticky mounts ( double sided , the kind where all you have to do if pull on a tab and the adheasive should come right off with out damaging the surface ) .
the speed is too slow , even over a 100mb network , due to its broadcast nature
with switch price so low , buy a switch instead of this one
size : 5speed : 2feature : 2easy of use : <NUM>
after upgrading to all gigabit networking , i ended up using this router as a small local router for my tivo
it was fine for several years and then it just died a few days ago
only port <NUM> shows activity any longer - ports are dead
i have never had a router fail like this before ( and i have <NUM> in my current home network in various places all over the house )
i was using the original transformer that came with it and measured the voltage - it was pumping out 10
6v under no load and 9
5v when connected to the linksys
that is <PERCENT> over the proper voltage ( 7
5v ) ! it is quite possible that the unit during it is lifetime would have shortened its life .
this linksys switch is a basic network device that is used in home networks and large companies
it does what it is designed to do , and does it well
there is no configuration , and no set up , just plug and play
i own several of these , and i have never had to touch it after installing it onto my network
there is a basic switch ; there is no port filtering , no protocol filtering , and no interference
some higher end switches come with those features , but in the end they just end up slowing the network down unless they are higher end
anyone that requires those features should not consider this switch , or any device in this price range
it will just slow your network down , go with an enterprise solution from hp , cisco or similar
for <PERCENT> of the home and small business users looking to buy this , i recommend it highly
it professionals , or network managers i would look at either a gigabit switch , or something more advanced
on larger networks , with 200+ users , if you install ten of these it will increase latency , and decrease the speed of your network
i am an it manager and these are great for small singular uses , but do not build or manage your networks with these types of devices
you are asking for trouble down the line
back to <PERCENT> of users , this device is perfect for you
i feel obligated to share my more technical advice for the people in my profession that may purchase this switch .
i needed an additional hub or switch to run from my wireless dsl/cable router ( which only had <NUM> pc/uplink port )
this switch worked great , and seemed to be priced comparable to many hubs , which would have worked fine for me , but obviously not given the benefits of the switch
if you need to add a few more computers to your existing network , this product is great .
i bought this router to split the connection in my room so i could connect to my xbox and my computer at once , and its working perfectly so far .
i had no idea what this is/was , but i bought it
it works ! good price , excellent service ( delivery ) .
within a month of purchase , <NUM> of the <NUM> channels on this switch were dead
this is unacceptable quality control on such a simple device .
bought this switch to connect a couple of pcs and a wireless access point to my router/modem
performs exactly as a switch should , in a small package , and for a reasonable price .
i gave this item <NUM> stars because it does what its supposed to do but not what i and most likely you want it to
you cannot connect two computers , at the same time , to the internet with this device
you need a router
printer sharing and file sharing didnt work either
two calls to linksys tech support and my own personal attempt to make it work add up to strike three
unless you have a complicated set up , it basically does nothing
forget this thing and suck it up and get a router , sure routers are a painbut they do what you want
this doesnt
a friend of mine wants it so he is getting a very early xmas present this year .
i have been a cisco/linksys loyalist after cut one too many corners on me in 2005
so the need to extend my is ports out to an effective <NUM> meant buying a small <NUM> port from linksys and to buy it through amazon
well , i plugged the puppy in on the same strip as my wrt54g and my cable "modem" and immediately noticed a low , but irritating , hum coming from the power brick
i gave it a week or so to ensure that normal house noise would cover the noise
no joy
if i am in that room studying i can hear the buzz
i called linksys tech support and they said 1 ) no known issues existed with the power supply brick and 2 ) i was supposed to go to a local electronics store and buy a replacement brick to diagnose the problem ! nope , that doesn not work for me
my solution - i am ordering a replacement unit today from amazon and will return one or both
while linksys is now cutting corners like , i have faith that amazon won not
they recently took care of a kindle issue that was more my fault than theirs .
i bought this for use in a dorm room , where i needed to turn one port into multiple ones ( for pc , xbox 360 , etc )
this switch works great
i plugged it in and it worked right away
i have recommended this product to several friends .
i mean this thing is small
i am a network administrator , but i only have one ethernet port in my office , so i needed a switch ( or hub ) to allow me to add more than one computer to the network in here
this thing sits on my desk and have a really small footprint
it is awesome
it has all the indicator lights i need/want , and it fast , really fast
i have always been a fan of linksys products , and this one is no different
if need a hub and can spare a few bucks for a switch , they are faster , and this one is great
and yes , it has an uplink port .
i replaced an old hub on my home network with this
i was getting an lot of "collisions" and slow performance
this unit cleared that up
can not beat the price !
the "linksys ezxs55w etherfast 10/100 workgroup switch" is a fairly simple device that allows for the easy expansion of your existing network
this switch connects to your router and gives you an extra to connect other devices to the network
the devices can all have different duplex/speed settings and they will work fine
this switch is very inexpensive , costing about the same as a simple hub
it was simple to set up , taking less than <NUM> minutes , and has never given me any problems
highly recommended !
this is a very useful product for those people who have more devices than they do network jacks
it works , and it is inexpensive
as more and more consumer electronic products come out , the greater the need will be for devices like these
i am currently using this product to share a single network jack between a windows pc and a macintosh pro
speed is much more than sufficient
your internet connection speed will be the bottleneck in most cases , not your home network
one thing to keep in mind though is that not all devices will work if you have this switch between the device and your office network is switch/hub
i could not get the ip telephone at work to function through this switch
however , the computers have no trouble under the same conditions
i confess that i am not knowledgeable when it comes to ip phones though
this is a very handy device
i highly recommend it .
i bought this thinking it could work with my isp service and a cable modem to have multiple computers share internet access but i was dead wrong
the unit doesn not seem to allow the sharing of a single ip address and that is all my roadrunner isp allows for each account
so , if you are in socal and are with roadrunner , i suggest you get a router
linksys has a decently affordable one--the linksys befsr41 etherfast cable/dsl router
check it out
but not to beat this puppy with a shovel , it is not a bad switch
file transfer rates between computers through the switch aren not too bad and it is a cinch to install
just remember to check all your network settings
peace out .
just to be clear , this is a switch and not a router ! search online for the difference between a switch and a router to learn more
i wanted to share the internet access from my cable modem with my computer and my new internet capable player
well , i found out the hard way that this switch will not do the trick ! if you already have a ( wired or wireless ) router between your cable modem and your computer then you can use a switch like this to connect more computers
it just gives you more ports but it does not convert ip addresses to the outside world ( which is what you need when you want to access the internet from multiple network devices )
i bought a router from best buy for $40 , but you can of course also buy them on amazon
they are a little bit more expensive then a simple switch
anyway , just wanted to let everyone know ! otherwise i guess it works just fine !
i have had an aging 10mbps linksys hub as the core of my small home network for several years
even though i was happy with it , i bought one of these , primarily because it was cheap and thought having a ispare' couldn not hurt
i had no idea how much that aging piece of equipment was slowing down my network ! almost everything i have now is 10/100 , so dropping in this switch made my whole network a heck of a lot faster
furthermore , as a switch ( as opposed to a hub ) , it is much more efficient with the use of the network - traffic isn not broadcast everywhere , only to the nodes that need it
i am very happy with this purchase
cheap , fast , and simple installation to my existing network
i decided to purchase another as a ispare' and donate my older hub to history .
i decided to go with an ethernet home network because of its speed and secutity
i had a cable running through the attic to another room where i had a computer attached to the network
i needed to add another computer in that room to the single cable and was not sure how best to proceed
after doing some research on the web , which included learning the difference between a hub and a switch ; i discovered the switch should do the job i needed done
i plugged the ethernet cable from the router into port one , and a desktop into port <NUM> and the laptop into port 3
it all connected and worked properly once i had set up the laptop to connect to the network
it is now working perfectly and the switch is invisible to the network , but is quietly doing its job
i am using the linksys router and switch and they are doing the job i needed done
i am completely satisfied with the product .
i combined this switch with thelinksys gaming adapterto extend my wireless network to wired devices located in a room other than the one that contains my router
this switch gives me extra ports to connect my slingbox , ooma , player , and television to my home network/internet
since the device is so simple , there is very little that can go wrong with it
potential buyers should consider how many devices they want to connect , and then add one or two ports for future devices
six months ago , i never would have expected to need one ethernet port , let alone four , in my family room ; with changes in technology , you may need to upgrade to a larger workgroup switch sooner than you expect
if you are only worried about and one or two game consoles , then this switch should be adequate both now and in the near future

i pulled it out of the box & plugged it into a router port and added my two printers
didn not even have to configure the one printer , easy "add device" for the other printer
switches are tiny now and it was so easy
it is hidden and i don not plan on touching it for years
the specialty router costs $200 and a port went bad
$22 is a lot cheaper
thank you for extending the ports .
i bought this switch when my home network started to grow and was not able to accommodate all the new devices that i was adding to it
several of those devices do have wireless capabilities , but i felt much better with having them directly connected to the ethernet through the wired way
this is both for security reasons as well as for the sake of reliability the speed of connection
a full additional router for that purpose would be unnecessary and much of an overkill , and this switch seemed like a perfect solution
when i got it i was at first surprised with how small it was - it is hardly larger than a deck of cards
the small size belies its performance , since it worked perfectly and impeccably form the very moment i had it set up
i have been using it for about half a year now , and have not had any performance or other issues with it
its small size is a bonus since it doesn not add to the electronic clutter at home
the front lights give you an indication of the working status of several network features
overall , i have been extremely satisfied with it and for the price there is probably no better switch on the market right now .
was adding a network printer and needed more connectivity
prior experience with linksys gear influenced the decision
the switch is compact and does all that was expected .
if you buy this product you better pray it works
i purchased this product and it didn not work , sent it back to amazon to get replaced
then it still didn not work
you might think that it was my setup but tech support has confirmed that it wasn not , and that this is the 2nd 'faulty' switch
however they have failed to send me an rma number to send it back to them
i have called every day for the past <NUM> weeks to try and obtain this elusive 'rma confirmation email'
as of right now their tech support/customer service <NUM> number isn not even working or is overloaded
if you buy this product , i hope it works for you
but if you think you might need some service from the company , you may want to think about going to a competitor ( are there any in this price range ? ) .
this was a quick , easy way to give me the extra slots on my network i needed
it was as easy as plugging it in and connecting to the existing router , and then hooking up whatever devices i needed to add to it
works great !
very good workgroup switch it seems it imporved my connection a lot better and took a huge load off my router its self what used to take <NUM> seconds to load a webpage only takes like <NUM> seconds now i think it imporved my connection to the psn on ps3 witch my games never did lag before using this but it has imporved the connection status & ps3 connection overall this is prefect plus the bandwidth is 10/<PERCENT> better then using the standard modem & router a must buy for those looking to improve a lot on there connection & bandwidth i , m most impressed with this product now its time to switch my netgrear router out with a linksys wireless or wired
very good 1/5update using this product after <NUM> months it keeps saying there was a connection problem and i my connection straight into my router without the switch and my connection is all good humm well thats not good for this switch and the name on the product linksys i thought that linksys was a good product but as i'v seen with this switch i don not think i will be getting a linksys router .
i had been using a linksys router for a few years before buying this switch
then i changed to a new dsl provider ( frontiernet ) whose modem is also a router , so i picked up this switch to split my connection to various computers in my home ( having two routers on frontiernet caused problems with tcp port forwarding )
first , i was surprised by the compact size of the switch
i hooked it up and it was good to go - a slick connection and no messing around
it is a perfect companion to the speedstream <NUM> dsl modem , and probably many others .
installation was a snap ! i wanted to connect a couple of things to the internet in my living room , so i bought this switch
plugged in my dvr receiver , a ps3 , and and iptv stb all to it
no or configuring at all
just plugged in and boom , instant internet to everything .
worked great no problem did the job it was need for
can not say much else
i have no dislikes about it .
with this device i can connect my pc and xbox <NUM> at the same time
i was able to purchase this for less than $20 dollars
the speed on gaming is better then with my previous device
, one of the better investments i have made !
nice little box
it tucks away in the corner
i am using it to extend the ports on my dsl router
the fact that it has an uplink port is helpful
no extra cable to buy .
maybe i didnt read the description well , but i recevived something different from the picture , but it works , it is all what matters , but the picture must be updated , because it looks nicer than the picture .
i got this in the mail yesterday , opened it up , connected my ethernet cables , plugged it in , and i was instantly hooked up to my internet
i got this so i wouldn not have to swap out the ethernet cable between my <NUM> and ps3 when i wanted to play online ( personal choice to keep wired over wireless b/c i think performance is better wired )
so , i got this and as described above i set it up and it works flawlessly
both connected right away to the internet and i can have both connected and downloading stuff at the same time should i want
highly recommended .
i own the version of this switch back when cisco wasn not a part of it
in fact the computer this is being typed on is hooked up to it
my setup : 50mb cable internet via a motorola surfboard fed to a router
that feeds a cable threaded through my basement to an old netgear switch that died , hence the need for this new ezxs55w ver
2 switch
at that point my network splits and feeds the old version of this switch and then to this computer
until i bought this new ezxs55w switch , i was getting more than my promised 50mb download speeds all over my house
no issues at all
the internal network transfers were only slowed down by how fast the hard drives of various machines are
then my old netgear switch died , so i picked up this ezxs55w switch
everything slowed to a crawl
max downloads of 1
5mb per second
streaming netflix/amazon prime videos to my sharp connected tv takes ages to load and it is always low quality
network transfers are brutal
took me a few days to realize what it was
so i went out and bought another brand of switch , swapped it for the ezxs55w , and miracle of miracles , all my speeds went right back to normal
again , my ezxs55w says ver
2 on it , i don not know if that is relevant
what i do know is this thing is a piece of junk
avoid .
update oct
2 , 2013
im not sure the item currently pictured is the product that we purchased and review way back when
original review from 2009the only thing i can say about this product is that i ordered it and gave the box to a coworker who ran out of ethernet ports in the wall
( needed to plug in <NUM> devices and only had two wall ports )
about <NUM> minutes later he came back and said it works
exactly what i wanted to hear
plug in and use .
it came and it turned on and nothing - ran an ip check on the network and nothing - software program ip check in case they changed the interface ip - the program sees my isp router but not this thing
use this in my dorm room to allow multiple connections to run from one internet port , works great on the xbox 360 , pc , and multiple laptops with no latency ( slowing ) .
this switch does exactly what i needed it to
it is small and easy to set up
ethernet cable goes in and five more come out
the ac plug is not a huge strip hoging brick
it took zero configuration to get it to work perfectly
i have a long ethernet cable that runs from the cable modem/router in the atic to my computer in my den
i plug that cable into this switch and then two cables come out to my computer and printer
now everything is networked with my wireless devices
it is exactly what i wanted
i might even get a networked hard drive now that i have the switch in my den
the price on amazon is really good too
i was going to buy this used on ebay , but found it here for just a few bucks more brand new
it has been running for a few weeks and i have not had any problems with it whatsoever
a+ product .
this switch is much smaller than it looks in the picture
i expected it to be the same size as my linksys routers so i could stack them , but no such luck
switch performs well .
i already had one of these behind a netgear router and recently added a second to accommodate some gaming systems and a new pc
the older switch is over a year old and has held up wonderfully with moves , a few drops on the floor , and signal drops from the cable modem in front of everything
no issues , great product and i would definitely recommend , all at a great low price too !
works fine when i bought it , covers the whole house all <NUM> sq ft
finally died after several years
bought a cisco valefolus to replace it
i loved the easy , no hassle set up and agree with the favorable reviews on this switch
one warning note though : if you connect the switch to the internet through a router you only have <NUM> usable ports , not 5
one of the <NUM> will be empty but not usable
not a problem for me and i put some tape over the unusable port to avoid confusion
( it is the one next to your ethernet connection
this little switch is a great buy for the money , a lot of features in a little package
if you need <NUM> more ports , this is a great buy !
i bought this when my network router went on the blink
since i had a dsl modem with a firewall , i didn not need another router and this product allowed me to connect <NUM> computers to the switch
installation took about <NUM> minutes and i noticed an increase in speed right away
i recommend this product to someone that doesn not need a firewall .
this little baby is just hook up my desktop , wireless ap , wired router togetherit just works , nothing elsetips : if you'd like to use overseas , buy nokia ac adaptor ( model ) , it just works with nokia phone chargerthat is all , no question asked
great switch and works
i have only minimal knowledge about networks
all i wanted was my tivo box to connect to my computer upstairs via a network cable , with an extra port provided by the switch downstairs for a computer to act as a media center to control stored tv programs and movies
i briefly read the manual online ( to see which outlet was the upstream outlet ) , plugged in the cables , and the box worked without any need to reboot the tivo , or alter any setting on the modem , router , or switch
network has been stable since setting it up , and problem free
network is comprised of linksys/cisco broadband router , a linksys/cisco wireless hub which is connected to the switch via a cable since the wireless link would not stay stable to permit a whole program to transfer via tivo desktop .
if you want a solid <NUM> port switch for your home network , don not look any further
linksys makes a quality product and you will be very happy with your purchase .
using this for my home network of <NUM> 100 mbps linksys in win98 machines plus a <NUM> mbps linux machine
works fine
there is no software driver required for this ( drivers are required and supplied with the nic cards that go in your machine )
looks really cute sitting on the shelf with the blinking leds ! hope to use it when eventually get dsl or cable internet access out here .
this was very easy to setup , just plug it in and it works ! i bought it to put in my room so i could split my ethernet to run to my desktop pc , gaming console ( s ) and even a laptop if for some reason i couldn not use wireless .
small , nice , worked the first time , unplugged the hub , in with the switch 10/100 full duplex and it works
i have a couple of these linksys switches alresdy
i needed a couple more and found the best price here
i use linksys for all my network needs .
i plugged in my workgroup switch , and then plugged in my , my dell gaming computer , and my dell laptop and everything worked just right
hard to improve on this thing for trouble free installation and operation , and the previous reviews were what guided me to select it .
i use dozens of these at my work when there is just one wall jack and i need to connect several pieces of equipment
note : this is just a dumb switch and not a router .
i bought this ezxs55w <NUM> years ago
there was no problem till <NUM> weeks ago
now the internet connection got very slow or i get error message ; " no connection"
since this product does not have a reset switch , i tried to power circuit this , router and cable modem
none helped
our wireless router is linksys is wrt54g
this one has been working without a issue since we purchase it in 2005
i tried to upgrade a router to is newer n product last year but found out wrt54g worked more stable , so i had to return a newer one
i trusted linksys more in the past
i do not think their quality and reliability are not good any more
very sad .
i bought this switch for the various devices in my rv
it is small , uses little power , and does what it is supposed to do transparently
it also stacks ( using optional stacking bracket ) with my linksys wireless bridge and router and cell phone router
with this setup , i can get wireless at campgrounds when available , and easily switch to the cell phone network when it is not
dish network works seamlessly with this system , so i can order ppv without a phone line
my son is xbox360 can reach xbox live
this switch is the "heart" of my rv network .
works as described and no complaints
i am using this for my tv , blu ray player , and xbox off of my linksys router
just make sure you hook everything up in the right order according to the directions on the cd and you will have no problems
i would recommend linksys to anyone .
the employee it was ordered for has been using it for awhile
seems to be working great .
i used this switch to simply add internet conncection to my xbox alongside my pc
i live in a college dorm with only one ethernet wall jack for my use , so i bought this switch and it works just fine
excellent speed and overall perfomance .
this product came in early and only took me a few minutes to set up and begin using ! my wife notices the speed of using this over the wireless in our home ( uverse wifi ) so she is very happy
will do business with this seller again ! thanks .
don not hesitate to get this
small , plug and play -- and for me it has worked for about a year with no problems .
works how its supposed to
only complaint is that it has poor documentation and could be unclear how to set it up
i was confused about the difference between hubs , switches , and routers
i just wanted to take the ethernet connection from my cable modem and split it to three other computers so that i could have a faster , direct connection since i have somewhat spotty wireless connection due to interference with neighbors routers
this switch did just the charm and was surprisingly inexpensive
so , if you have a modem with an ethernet out and want to connect multiple computers to the internet , this device will work for you .
installation and network was a snap
the fifth port is really the upstream connection
so you get four clients , not five .
cisco makes networking easy because their products just work right out of the box
i got exactly that with this switch which allowed me to plug in several networking devices with one ethernet source
i have this to the big hub and everything works like a dream with issues and no time at all .
they had free support until just very recently
my beef is with the extreme cost of support , 3
99 a minute
( i don not know if that includes listening for many minutes to bad music
) you can get <NUM> months support for $199 , <NUM> months for $299 or <NUM> year for $499 ! i can tell you i spent many hours talking to tech support before this recent change of events
i have had my linksys router for <NUM> years
i also had to get a bridge to extend the range because it couldn not go through walls very well
i had to call them a lot because sometimes the bridge or router somehow lost the address
you will need tech support now and again when you change isps , go elsewhere .
if you are a macintosh user , you should know of a very important limitation of all linksys hubs & switches , including this one : this switch will not route appletalk information on your network
what that means is that if you are a macintosh user who is trying to use file sharing via appletalk , or if you have an older appletalk printer ( such as the older line of hp laserjet printers ) , you will be out of luck with this switch
or any linksys hub/switch
besides the lack of macintosh appletalk support , this switch seems to work just fine .
this product has served me just fine
i have experienced no problems with this switch , and i am certainly glad that i got this because i have a computer on 10mb ( instead of 100mb ) , and i would not want that one computer to slow all the others down
it seems a little overpriced for what it does , but as a product , its performance has been optimal .
works great , good coverage
had a small problem setting it due to changeing my isp from cable to dsl
called tech support , and they walked me through the set up and even help with setting up my laptop
it is been two months since installation without any problems whatsoever .
running out of ports since i like wired wherever i can for better connectivity
worked exactly as i needed and gave me <NUM> additional ports
great price and it does what a hub should do
i have had multiple versions of this switch and all work well with my home networking needs for netflix and slingbox
i recommend it .
this product performs as described
i have no complaints
i bought it to use multiple computers from my internet connection using wired connections
so far it is worked flawlessly .
this is the worst router that i have ever had
continues to drop like crazy even with latest firmware from linksys
i ended up to throw it aside .
i purchased this switch like most folks to allow an existing linksys cable modem/router to provide an internet signal to an additional ethernet port in my house
in the meantime , i recently bought a sony player with internet video streaming , but i found that the existing linksys modem/router could not handle the upgraded service
so i bought a new motorola docsis 3
0 cable modem
i naively thought i could simply use this linksys switch to send the signal along its merry way throughout my house
after several hours of reseting the ip address on each computer , and several calls to charter ( my isp ) , i called motorola
the motorola surfboard modem is a throughput device , that assigns only one ip and the linksys switch is not a smart/managed type that can assign individual ip addresses
so i have a new router on its way from amazon , which should solve the problem , once i place the router immediately after the modem but before the switch ! the router will then assign an unique ip address to my four computers and player
perhaps this is common knowledge , but the technical support staff at charter were not aware of this
so just an fyi .
this switch works fine and does what it is supposed to do
the one i received is all black , and there is another listing for it on amazon
i don not get the negatives i have read here
someone said it gets hot
well , where are you keeping it ? it is a simple little digital switch that doesn not create any heat
maybe a slight watmth
another said something about it being cheap , plastic junk
it is actually a very good quality piece of equipment at a very good price
i guess if it is not a huge , heavy , expensive thing they perceive it as being cheap
there was also a complaint about cutomer service
i will admit i have not had to call linksys cutomer service for years , but the <NUM> or <NUM> times i have , they are the best
imagine , actually getting a human person on the phone and walking you through everything you need
bottom line : qulity product
good price
i wish i needed more of these little things
there almost fun to buy and plug all your gadgets in
and oh yeah , very easy and simple "plug and play" installation
for those that insist that nothing is perfect , my only design change would be to eliminate some of the indicator lighting on the front
there are about <NUM> little lights on there
my "office" area already looked like christmas at night with all of the leds shining off of everything from my computer to the phone to the clock and everything else
now there are many more colorful lights .
what else do you need to know ? you plug in your pcs and a cable to your router - and go
i used a netgear hub for years
replaced it with this linksys switch and my network speed improved immediately .
this is a simple commodity product that works fine
tiny complaint is that the cables come out of the front of the box , would be better if they attached at the back .
this switch does exactly what it is designed for , sharing an ethernet connnection
don not expect to be able to configure vlans , multilayer switching , vlan trunks , load balancing , etc
this does not have any routing , nat , or firewall capabilities
you would use this switch when you already have a router between your internal network and the internet , and you need additional ethernet ports
this gives you a full duplex ethernet connection at wired speed , and it delivers ! perfect for the home office/lan or for technicians needing extra etherenet ports for their workbench , as this is what i use mine for
thanks for reading ! hope this helps !
this linksys switch does what it is supposed to do
i was able to connect all <NUM> computers to it and had no issues with operating all <NUM> at the same time
i trust linksys is products
i bought this little switch because my home network has expended a bit recently
i had been using <NUM> port netgear wireless router to hook up everything and had already ran a wire to the basement of my house for the xbox 360
when i added another computer in the basement i needed to be able to run an ethernet cable to it but didn not want to run another cable to the basement
i bought this and hooked up the computer and the 360
i can use both at the same time and it doesn not effect the rest of my network upstairs
i still can connect the <NUM> as a media center extender and stream music from any of my connected computers
in summary this switch works exactly like i expected .
the linksys ezxs88w etherfast 10/100 workgroup switch does the job great , i did not have any problem with any linksys product
i use this switch with a wrt54g router because i needed extra wired ports
i gave <NUM> stars because i want a volts transformer , this version use a <NUM> volts one
i have noticed quite a few comments related to the size difference between cisco is compact and standard series ; finally , a problem with a simple and cheap solution ! linksys sells a pack of very versatile plastic mounting plates that not only allows you to mount components vertically on the wall or you can stack them
when stacking the compact to the standard , you will notice the form has places for the feet of either series on each side so you can mix and match as you see fit
the box comes with a load of these , more than i can not imagine anyone including your "netties" , finding a use for all of them , but the small expense offsets any concern about leftovers ! the linksys description and part number for a box of these are "wall mount and stacking bracket" mo
sm01 , the color could be described as deep grey or charcoal : very handy , very cheap , either tough polymer or plastic , and very simple
as for the linksys switch above i have two and both installed easily and operate trouble free
this switch compares favorably with slightly less expensive is desktop switch
i am no expert but i don not see much difference between the two with the execption of is missing "uplink" port tied into the eigth port
both are plug and play
now back to my own network madness , ( q^ ( q^ ( q$q ! * ax~
i wanted to replace my old switch , where i had my motorola cable modem , my server and my linksys wireless router
worked great as soon as i hooked up
smaller than the switch i had , and design and color match my wrt54g
wanted this model , and amazon got the best price
can not complain .
bought this after i ran out of ports on my wireless router
plugged it in and works great
can not ask for more .
i bought this to replace a linksys switch that died after several years of use
i will be surprised if this one lasts a year
i definintely got a bad one , but it is so inexpensive , it is not really worth the expense and inconvenience of returning it to either linksys or the marketplace seller
this should be a device , and probably is if you get a good unit
mine , on the other hand , thinks there is always something connected to port 4 , bringing down the entire network
actually connecting something to port <NUM> solved that problem , but i am still experiencing intermittant periods of packet loss of about <PERCENT> that require multiple restarts of the switch to correct
if you are looking for an inexpensive switch , i might suggest buying several of these so you can be sure to get at least one good one , keep another good one as a backup , and return the remainder
otherwise spend the extra money for a switch made by a company with actual quality control .
i have always used linksys products and very good reliability from them
this is no exception as soon as i applied power and hooked up all my devices the unit performed without incident .
i have had two linksys products die on me shortly after a year ( a router/switch , and now this switch )
it works fine until it dies ( but that is like saying a stapler staples correctly : it is supposed to )
just to note : i run them in a very friendly environment -- no dust or heat or voltage spikes or any of that to blame for the problem
( also , you can count me as an "expert user"
) i myself will never buy another linksys product again -- i will try out netgear & dlink and other brands , but goodbye cisco/linksys
if you chooose to try their products , caveat emptor .
i have several other linksys switches so i decided to pick this one up
i have never had a problem w/ any of my linksys switches ; however , this one was another story
at times my printers would see it and at times they would not
i have <NUM> computers networked and at times they could see it and other times not
an undefined network showed up in my network and sharing center as if the switch was acting like another entire network ( which i did not have access to )
i finally gave up trying to make it work and bought a trendnet unmanaged gigabit greennet desktop metal housing switch ,
i plugged it in , the mysterious network disappeared and everything worked perfectly right out of the box : my magic jack , computers , printers , scanner , two tv is and two players
what more can be said .
i work in technology and have for the last <NUM> years
there are two products that i have that really impressed me
tivo 2
linksys router/switchwhat it takes for me to actually be impressed by a technology product it has to be simple , ( plug and play simple ) the right price or better and be <PERCENT> reliable or better
this product is simple , just plug the darn thing in and it works
you only need to configure it if you want to do something a little
it has yet to fail me and i have had it for quite some time
if you need to share a high speed internet connection like dsl or cable this product is the best i have seen
also in it ; is latest incarnation it supports pppoe so it will work with any dsl provider out there without having to install the crummy isp software on your actual workstation
oh yeah and don not forget it supports nat ( network address translation ) so it basically acts as a firewall as well .
serves its purpose ! quick and easy setup very little to no knowledge required to setup
highly recommended for home use .
i was able to make my home with the addition of my access point and this <NUM> point hub
now all the rooms in my home are adequately hooked up and are up and running with the internet
im very pleased with this purchase .
this is a great little box for connecting a small network without breaking your bank
the ezxs88w has a great work/size ratio
it is small enough to set on top of a computer case and provides eight ports of full duplex , 10/100 networking
it has a very informative display to give out info for connection speed , duplex connection and collision
the setup is as simple as plugging in the power and network cables
i have yet to run into any problems with this unit and would recommend it without a second thought .
technology that outdates itself quickly
now with this is old technology that lasted about year for me
the system worked ok but is history now .
cisco bought linksys a while back -- smart move ! can not get any easier -- works great , while it is smaller than the linksys router , it still sits nicely on top , although feet pattern does not match .
if you are considering buying this switch , you most likely have more than a few computers to network
and if you are the casual home user , this switch will give you appreciable performance at a great price
as a geek with <NUM> computers with a mixed os network , i can say that this switch ( which was an upgrade from a 10/100 hub ) really improved my network connections
first off , you should know the difference between "hubs" and "switches"
hubs are your typical central connecting device that will allow you to hook up more than one computer on to the network at a time
they are usually quite cheaper than switches , at the price of loss of performance
switches have separate bandwidths for each port , unlike hubs ; thus , allowing more traffic to go through between each computer on your network
of course , if you are going to be doing nothing but sending and occasional web surfing , a cheap hub will do all of this for you
but for the heavy gamers or those that want to use network intensive tools will appreciate the individual bandwidth that each port gets
some people complain that by switching to this switch , their network performance has decreased
this was the case with one of my computers , where transfer rates sharply fell from <PERCENT> capacity to <PERCENT> in a matter of seconds , rendering a 1gb file transfer practically impossible
after a bit of analysis , i found <NUM> causes for this : 1 ) faulty cabling , and 2 ) cheap unreliable network adapter
if you have cheap old network cables that have been crushed by chairs , doors , etc
, they could be affecting the reliability of your network , and the full duplex operations of the 100mbit network could be adversly affected by line conditions to where it has to resend packets to correct transmission errors
the other common culprits are cheaply constructed network adapters ( nic is ) with especially poorly written drivers
i replaced all wiring with 350mhz cat 5e cabling and replaced all cheap cards ( e
, cnet pro 200 ) with higher grade ones , and the reliability and transfer rates have soared to a little under theoretical maximum throughputs
according to a network expert , some recommended cards are ( uses the rtl <NUM> chipset ) or 3com etherlink or 905tx series
too many people blame the switch when it is really their setup is fault , and it should be pointed out that the switch is very and easy to setup
it should be pointed out that the switch does make an electric "fuzz" noise that many switches/hubs will generate
if you are using quiet computers or laptops or are planning on putting the switch anywhere quiet , you might find the noise distracting
however , it is a subtle "quiet" sound , so the level may vary depending on your perception of loudness
also , if you have more than <NUM> computers , it should be noted that these switches are not stackable so you it won not be as neat
wall mounting is possible and probably recommended , as a small , device such as this tends to not stay on the ground very well if the angles at which you plug in the network cables lifts or pulls on it
there aren not any true flaws in the product , works and performs well , and i readily recommend it to anyone seeking to setup or improve a home network on a budget .
 with my existing network , which is comprised of router , netgear switch and this linksys switch
they all play well together
i am happy with this purchase .
overall i am very pleased with this workgroup switch
the speeds are just as good as being connected directly to the modem
the only thing worth noting is that the device i received is colored different
instead of being blue and black the one i received was all black
as i said , this made no material difference , the device has worked properly for over <NUM> years now
very satisfied .
a perfect switch for my home network
i have been using it for months
it is cascaded off my <NUM> port router when my network expanded
works flawlessly
you just plug into your network and your up and running
my network consists of a netgear router feeding this switch which in turn feeds a wireless access point
my only complaint is that i should have bought the <NUM> port unit as this one is full
network novices should remember that an <NUM> port switch is really only a <NUM> port switch as the 8th port is shared with the wan uplink
at least this switch has the separate uplink port .
the ezxs88w etherfast 10/100 workgroup switch does exactly what it is advertised to do - <NUM> ports , plug it in , and it works great
it doesn not get any better than this
i could whine - it doesn not stack ( without a mount ) on my wrt54gl
i solved this by not stacking it .
awesome product - i ordered this because my <NUM> port router was more than full
plugged the switch into the router then into the wall and it was done
very easy , no setups , no firmwares , simple
one thing you should be aware of ( i am not going to rate the products itself less because of this ) is that the next generation models are out
it is the same thing but they are considerably smaller than the previous version
amazon should really update there picture
i have this stacked on top of my linksys wireless router and it does fit but it does not lay in the four corners and previous linksys products
not a big deal and still looks fine but just a heads up
<NUM> stars
first off would like to state that i love linksys devices
it was shipped to me rather quickly and when i opened the box it was a total different product
now i don not mean different product as in it wasn not a linksys
it was in fact a linksys but it wasn not blue and black like i thought it was and models i have seen in the past
it in fact was an all black model
to be honest i was really glad about that because most of my networking products ( other linksys devices ) are all black
i run my xbox through this along with a wireless access point which is a linksys as well .
i needed to add more devices in my office and this switch worked well
very easy to setup and use .
amazon does not give it is <NUM> day price guarantee on this item because it is sold by a company other than amazon
watch out when you buy from amazon .
i have had a linksys gigabit switch for a few years and was never really pleased with it
recently , it started acting up and finally gave out completely
i bought this 10/100 because it was cheap
i was a bit worried because it wasn not gigabit but it works fine
a network expert would probably tell me that a gigabit switch was surplus to requirements for home use
a 10/100 that works is infinitely better than a 10/100/1000 that doesn not work
i use this for streaming - roku <NUM> xs , , sonos , hopper
actually , the hopper is sort of a reverse streaming thing
it has a slingbox on it .
i had a problem with one i was using and decided to get this one
works right out of the box because its a switch no config
is needed
i would buy another one .
works as advertised
mine has been working well since i bought it
i have it in a network with one other linksys switch , a linksys router , and a dozen devices .
the form factor was not exactly as shown in the picture with the large linksys stackable legs , which would have been nice as i have all linksys stackable routers and waps
rather it is the exact same unit without the large stackable legs
i can still stack it , and the smaller legs do interlock with other like units , which i have also
i prefer to stack components rather then have them sit side by side all over the place , and a lot of the new form factors are stand alone , facing up , or standing on their side , made to be the only componet for the average home user
if your network is more extensive with several waps and switches along with your router stacking saves space and just looks better
but either way for $29 it was a great deal ! i have found linksys products to be very reliable
i have a router , two waps and two switches , all linksys products that all work great .
the linksys <NUM> port workgroup switch was just what i was looking for
i used this product to wire our small library to <NUM> computers and wireless access
it works great .
works good so far
just remember to connect your computers in the order that the ports are labeled
i was having some connection problems until i realized i had moved some cables around and skipped a port .
i got this router for my entertainment system
now a tv , av/receiver , media player , brd player , game console all need connections , that is 5
i did not go with a gigabit router , since streaming and even gaming in general does not require that much bandwidth
the only problem i had was around connect the cat5 cable
i am not a network specialist , and frankly it took me forever to figure out that the &<HASHTAG> ; uplink&<HASHTAG> ; should not be used in this setting
so use port , and steer away from the uplink part
that is apparently needed for your router , but not for extending the wired network .
had a previous version that was destroyed due to power surge and replaced it as simple as plugging in the power cord and the cables .
an easy , reliable means to add ethernet ports to the typical router/hub
who ever thought <NUM> ports would be enough ? a whole lot easier than routers !
this is the second linksys switch i have owned
the first one served well for around ten years , and was a casualty in a recent move
when i needed more wired connections i looked around , but these are still the best for the sub-$100 price range
cisco recently sold linksys to belkin , which concerns me
i figured it would take some time for the manufacturing to go downhill ( i despise belkin and have never had a good experience with them ) , and i was right
this switch does not disappoint
some people swear by wireless , but you cannot beat the speed and security of a wired connection
i highly recommend this product and , assuming belkin doesn not taint the product line , would buy another one if my current one got crushed like my last one did .
take it out of the box , don not confuse yourself with the user guide provided , it is useless , and no quick setup guide ( use the ezxs55w quick set up avail on linksys site ) if you have to
or just power it up ( plug it in ) , install patch cable to link it to your network , in my case the router , plug in those extra cables you have been swapping around on the <NUM> ports on the router , and you are ready to go .
linksys <NUM> port switch ezxs88w ver 3
4 arrived fast in new shrink wrapped box from beach camera through amazon
the power adapter was dead on arrival
the switch ok
i had an old adapter for my <NUM> port to check it
<NUM> minutes on the phone and linksys is sending a new adapter rma in business days
hope it works ! i will be back if it doesn not
i am back
got the rma replacement power adapter from linksys in <NUM> days
no joy ! same problem ! i have requested by email a return for exchange or refund to beach camera and hope they cover the return postage in either case
so far i can not blame beach at all , but linksys support was less than cooperative the second time i called about the replacement adapter not solving the problem
the switch itself still will function with my old <NUM> port power adapter but neither of the new power adapters from linksys
i hooked my laptops to it and was up and running on the internet through the switch with the <NUM> port power adapter both times .
there is no doubt that this is a great switch and with <NUM> ports you cant go wrong
just plug it in and go
i have been using linksys for years with no problems , and we use all cisco equipment at the hospital where i work
i only gave <NUM> stars because the switch in the picture is not what i received
this switch is smaller and all black
really no big deal , but i like to receive what i am looking at
otherwise , i would have said <NUM> stars .
i am new to high speed internet
when a cable modem was installed this past saturday , i had no ethernet card , so usb was required
i was very happy with the connection , even though the download speed was falling quite short of the claims made by our local cable provider
but no matter , this was such a vast improvement over 56k that it just didn not seem to matter
one day later i found out about the at&t ; callvantage service , which allows you to have phone service via a high speed modem
price was very attractive , but one problem--an ethernet card was required for hookup
that was the reason for purchasing the lne100tx
i am still waiting for the callvantage equipment , but in the meantime the money spent on this card may be the best money i have ever spent--download speeds increased dramatically once this card was installed , compared to usb ! kb/sec speeds were being experienced with the usb connection ( on a fairly recent intel motherboard )
they immediately zoomed to kb/sec using the lne100tx
repeated tests of the download speed have yielded similar results , so i am confident that this upsurge can be attributed solely to the lne100tx
installation was quick/easy , and the price was right
i am very pleased , and surfing the internet is fun once more !
i'd like to tell you that it is better than a lot of other cards out there , but i don not think it is
when trouble shooting my network , i decided to return another ethernet card , made by another manufacturer , and see if that was my problem
since i was using a linksys router cable dsl hub , i thought it could be part of it
not , it performed the same
my performance problem turned out to be norton internet security , which was only installed on that machine
nothing to do with the hardware
all in all , this card is a very nice piece of equipment
it couldn not install any easier
booted down , with your power plug removed , you install it in an available pci slot
when rebooting , it asks for the driver , which is located on the included cd
it loads , and your off to the races
no configuring
just smooth performance
highly recommended
linksys has been only good to me .
i got this ethernet card when i upgraded to dsl
it works well and i never experienced connectivity issues from it .
if you asked me what network card to purchase under $20 it would be a between netgear and this card
i highly recomend both over those brand things you can get , but neither are the greatest
i have , however , used linksys cards ( including this one ) in many application and i have never had a problem
beware that the drivers aren not included in the os which can be a pain , but of course they include drivers , and their website posts the latest ones
if you can get an intel or 3com nic , do it
if you can not look at this one and the netgear
they will work for you .
a good quality network card for setting up a home network
i have <NUM> of these cards and have never had a problem with any of them
i also use the linksys switch to connect them all and share the internet with my dsl modem
these network cards are rugged and reliable , and an exceptional value for the price !
have used this company is products many times
this item is performing as i would expect it to do
linksys continues to have some of the best networking hardware available
i commend amazon for making linksys products available to its customers .
i recently picked up two of these cards to hang two systems off of a cable modem
the installation couldn not have been easier
just plug the card in and install the drivers
windows ( me ) had no problem recognizing the card on either machine
once the cable modem was installed everything worked like a charm
two words of warning : - the directions are very complete , but don not include specific directions for windows me
i doubt this would trip anybody up and the windows <NUM> directions are certainly good enough
- the drivers available on the linksys website require you to know information that is only available on the card
if for some reason your box doesn not have a driver disk ( one of mine didn not ) , make sure to download the correct driver set before installing the card .
don not you just love when plug n play really works the way that it is supposed to ? it took all of two minutes to pop this reliable performer into my winxp machine
xp immediately recognized it upon bootup ; i didn not even need to use the driver cd that came with the card
performance since then has been exactly what i expected with no hiccups
pros* true setup* configuration and solid performance* price - under $$$ with the current manufacturer is rebatecons* linksys registration requires the serial number which is only on the card itself - write it down before installation
i bought this little fella while it was on sale , andwith a [$$$] rebate
it was practically free
i am running windows <NUM> on a older dell dimension ( p333 w/192mb ram )
the installation of the card was very very easy
theinstructions with the unit were very clear
i , but i still though the text and the supportingcolor pictures were great
the software installation on window 2000s was a snap
ididn not even need the support disk
windows 2k recognizedthe card , and installed it all for me
i love
linksys is a reputable company
linksyshas a great website as well
i bought this product forthe name recognition and price
i have had it installed fora few months and have had nothing but great success .
picked this up at a local store and glad i didn not pay more for another brand
i got it for my dad who is finally going dsl
installation was a breeze in his win98 system
the package already comes with the latest drivers for the various flavors of win95 and win98 , and if you use winxp , the os already has the drive for this card , so it is pure
just install the card in a pci slot , turn on your computer , and maybe install the driver ( depending on the os version ) , and you are all set
compatible with dsl and cable modems
this is one excellent value
( there is a wire for the "" feature
i don not have a lan , so don not know if it actually works
i bought like a dozen of these cards ranging from version <NUM> to version 5
1 and all of them work very well in my lan
i will recommend them to my friends and continue to buy them for my desktop pcs
they slap in and install perfectly w/o any problems
i have never had one fail or run erratically
strong buy .
i bought this card with the idea of using it with linux ( mandrake 7
x ) because linksys had drivers and support page for linux installation
i finally gave up just short of the kernal ( network card should not be *that* difficult to support )
after spending serveral days search the net for updated drivers and newgroup info on the card , i decided it wasn not worth the effort and i put my intel <NUM> chipset card back in ( which now works with the latest dist of mandrake )
windows install was odd , but finally worked after tweeking the bios settings .
i had no trouble installing this card in my windows <NUM> server
i connected my cable modem to it and success came quick and easy
it has been in use for several months without any problem
great product , great price
i also have one of these in my windows nt computer on this network - where it is also working fine
cheers !
if you don not realize that pci stands for programmable computer interface , then you are the kind of goober who shouldn not be doing his own upgrades
otherwise you can work out any potential problem with this card just fine
i put two in some windows me machines and the driver software wasn not on the floppies that came with them , so i went to their website and downloaded them , installed them and was fine
they are performing flawlessly with my linksys hub for cable modem and two other disimilar systems with different cards and computer set ups
i see no reason to pay the <NUM> com price for a ethernet card--and i think <NUM> com is now in trouble .
i am extremely pleased with this product
i purchased it to get away from using the usb connection for my cable internet connection
on usb , the computer would hang quite frequently
i have not experienced any hangs since installation of this card
installation went smoothly ; very impressed with its performance .
for some reason the ethernet port on my mobo would not show up , so i purchased this to hard wire my router into my dsl modem
this was done trying to get the magicjack to work , it did not help
one good thing did happen though , my ethernet port showed up and all is good with that now
this board is doing as good as can be expected .
i really liked this card until i bought a netgear fs108 10/100 switch
no matter how i configured the lne100tx card , it would only talk to the switch if i forced it to 10mbps mode
forcing to 100mbps wouldn not work , nor would autonegotiation
if i wanted a 10mbps card , i would have gotten one
this is a poor performer .
i have <NUM> linksys cards in my home network
the price was right and they have worked without a hitch
installation was as easy as any network card under windows <NUM> se
compatible with my via and ali chipset motherboards
use with their <NUM> port hub or switch ( hub with uplink port ) .
the card arrived securely packed
easy to follow instructions , and it works great !
i dropped this card into my dell tower , which has partitions for fedora core <NUM> linux ( the one i use most ) and windows me ( only used when i have to
) it worked great
so i put another one into my wife is quantum , which runs nt 4
installation took a little more fiddling , but the card worked flawlessly after i'd found the right driver
it is inexpensive and it does everything we need for home networking .
if you want a quality network lan computer card by an excellent company , this is it .
i had a cnet network card before and got terrible network performance
then i decided to switch to these linksys cards , and they worked like a charm
coupled with the linksys <NUM> port workgroup switch home networking is a breeze
so why did i give it <NUM> stars ? i wanted to use the feature of the card , since my old cnet had it
but when i got the new linksys card , the wol was only through a feature called pme ( power management event ) , whereas the cnet ( and other cards ) provide a wol cable that connects to the motherboard
the linksys card did not provide for this cable
also , the card is version 5
1 but keeps appearing as version <NUM> in windows xp .
no problems , worked under 98 , nt , 2k and linux ( tulip ) .
linksys is a leader in networking for good reason
i first got this card because of my new cable internet connection
even if you are a novice computer user with no experience in computer hardware you can install this card youself ! the directions are very good with step by step instructions that are easy to read for anyone
once you have it installed the driver instructions are also easy to read and offer them for any operating system you can think of
if you are running windows xp ( or thinking of upgrading ) you don not even need to install the drivers yourself because they are built into windowsxp and it will install itself making instulation that much easier ! they also have a nice webpage that further explains troubleshooting if you get into a problem for some reason ! don not go pay some store bucks to install a network card you can do it yourself in <NUM> mintues for nothing and linksys makes it possible at a very good price ! also , after having the card installed for over a year it has never gave me any problems whatsoever ! i wish i could say that about some other hardware that i have purchased !
this card is easy to install and it will work right after you install the driver and restart your system ( 95 , 98 , 98se )
don not fall with the [inexpensive]nic , go with bus mastering
it will make you happy !
inconsistent quality , iffy installation in windows , and diagnostics only in dos
this is the linksys lne100tx
we have plenty of our customer who opt for this card and have ended=up regretting doing so
the price is what initially attracts , but the shabby construction , questionable installation , and high failure rate - not to mention linksys' horrible customer support
avoid this one
you are not saving any money buying this card
you are only gaining headaches and dissappointment with the linksys card .
this is a basic network adapter that works well and does it job
if that is what you are looking for , you cant go wrong with it .
 : if you need an affordable , reliable , and configure nic look no further than the linksys "lne100tx etherfast 10/100 lan card
"for the past few months the unthinkable has been happening , my intel pro 100/1000gbps network interface card ( nic ) had been failing
i didn not want to believe it , but the last few days it has been none too obvious
the problem : every time i restarted the ( file ) server the nic was installed in , the adapter flapped , that is the link was dropping for long seconds , then come back for a minute , then dropping the link again
the only way to resolve the issue was to turn the server off , unplug the cable from the nic , turn the server back on , log into windows , then plug the cable back into the nic
after this procedure the nic would stabilize
by not following the procedure the server would hang at "applying security settings
"i played this game for the last three months until i finally grew tired of the drill
i caved in and slid my ( spare ) linksys "lne100tx etherfast 10/100 lan card" into the pci slot
problem solved ! the 411the "lne100tx etherfast 10/100 lan card" is a high performance nic designed for desktop computers with pci expansion slots
right out of the box , the "lne100tx etherfast 10/100 lan card" is ready to run on both 10baset and 100basetx networks
the 10/100mbps nic can automatically detect your networks maximum speed and adjusts itself to the appropriate speed
the "lne100tx etherfast 10/100 lan card" also features ( wol ) a feature that allows you to remotely turn on the computer
the nic is equipped with two led is ; amber to denote a network connection speed of 100mbps , and ; green ( link/activity ) to signal that the card has been connected to a network
the light will flicker when data is being transmitted and received over the network
the can accept a category 3 , or 5 , network cable
first impressionsi am very pleased with my new linksys "lne100tx etherfast 10/100 lan card
" i installed the nic in a dell tower computer with windows <NUM> server standard edition
after the nic was detected windows <NUM> installed the appropriate drivers ; afterwards the "lne100tx etherfast 10/100 lan card" was ready to use at full 100mbps duplex ; that is 200mbps
conclusionsince installing the "lne100tx etherfast 10/100 lan card" all has been well with the servers' network connectivity
though i have always installed intel nic is in my server platforms , the linksys "lne100tx etherfast 10/100 lan card" has proven itself a worthy "stopgap" replacement and one i might just keep in place over the long haul .
iomega zip <NUM> mb usb external drivethis unit has a rounded dark blue case and is powered by the usb port
you should select the icon to "unplug or eject hardware" to remove this device
the iomega software should be installed on windows 2000
if the unit does not have an eject button on the drive you must select the eject command from the properties menu
it is good to do this all the time because of the disk caching system
the <NUM> mb drives can read and write to <NUM> mb zip disks , but slower than with a <NUM> mb disk
the fastest transfer is with an internal ide zip device
the "user is manual" warns against using the operating system to copy a disk
use the iomega "copy machine" program
right click on the zip drive to select the iomega "format" function
use "short format" to delete all data on an iomega disk
the "long format" repairs a drive with errors , converts from another format , or removes all passwords ( not usable on a 100mb disk )
"write protection" protects against writing over data , a password can protect against both reading and writing files
you can also flag the zip drive as "" so it appears like a hard drive
the manual has the details
computers have a limited number of ide devices and drive bays so a separate storage device is practical
replaceable <NUM> mb zip disks provided vast storage in the past but are no longer the latest in storage technology
the <NUM> mb zip disk is less widely used than the <NUM> mb disk
zip disks reuse deleted space unlike a cd whose space is consumed when you replace files
falling prices for cd discs solve that problem
a zip disk has no compatibility problems between different windows systems and computers
a cd written on one system may not be updated by different software on another system
[you may find support on the internet for usb mass storage devices for win98
]to test the status of a used zip disk
1 ) right click on the drive , select `properties'
2 ) select the iomega tab ( after support was installed )
3 ) select `diagnostics' , then `close' after the green light
4 ) select `more info' on the `disk type' note the `disk life status' and the `format life status'
percentages lower than about <PERCENT> are not good
5 ) a `long format' can improve the life status statistics .
i have over <NUM> years worth of files on zip disks and needed a new drive after my <NUM> year old drive died
i i get <NUM> years out of this one i will be more than happy .
i believe this is a better alternative to the usb drive and much better than a floppy disk drive
i have one at home in my desktop and another i use at work to backup important files
i don not have to worry about loosing it since it is big and it is very durable .
thanks to iomega for making such a great product
it worked easily with my toshiba laptop
i bought my toshiba about <NUM> years ago
i wasn not sure my usb connection would be compatible with the iomega drive
but , to my surprise , it worked just fine
now , i can backup all my important laptop files and transfer digital photos from my laptop to my desktop easier .
i needed a way to access some old data i stored many years ago and this was a perfect solution .
using this was confusing at first , but i quickly rectified the issue
there are two instances in which you will get a seriously annoying error trying to access the disk
1 ) if a disk is bad2 ) if you click on the mounted drivefor <HASHTAG> -- you are not supposed to click on the mounted drive , as this is simply a reference to the fact that the drive has been mounted at all
there will be a *second* entry that pops up -- that lists the volume label of the media you have inserted into that drive
please access it using that-- do not click on the mounted drive entry : ) if you click on the volume label only to get an error , this means your disk is bad
now , a bad disk does not necessarily mean "totally unaccessible" just as a bad hard drive does not necessarily mean that , either
sometimes a zip disk will access under one operating system , but not another -- when it is going bad
it also depends upon the file system you are using
if your zip disk is formatted in the fat16 / fat32 formats -- all oses should read it fine
if it is in ntfs -- only microsoft windows ( and unix , linux , etc distros which properly use the ntfs driver ) will be able to see it
if it is formatted under linux and you need to see this in microsoft windows -- you will need to google for and download a utility called ext2fs
be warned -- though they claim it works fine under vista , it breaks hard under vista
xp and lower only , please : )
this is my third zip drive but my first 250mb and of course my first usb
the usb interface worked fine on my desktop ( win 98 ) but the installation also enabled the usable usb port on my laptop ( win 95b )
i wasn not expecting this
i was going to buy the optional pcmcia interface - but this saves me the forty bucks
i didn not look at the transfer rate but it seems even faster than my <NUM> mb internal zip ( atapi interface ) on one of my 'puters
very fast ! recommended !
for those who have zip discs with old info this is good from which to copy .
i have got my zip running on a 1ghz pentium <NUM> with windows me and had no trouble getting it installed
have not had any system locks , either
it is much faster than my old zip <NUM> that ran on the parallel port , though the reads zip <NUM> disks with no problem ( though slower than <NUM> disks )
i am using iomega is quik sync software and it is great to have it operating automatically in the background , without me having to remember to do it
when i bought mine , the version was not yet available , so mine uses an ac power adapter
the version would be nice to have for running on my laptop .
bottom line : this model of zip drive is usb plug and play and powers itself off the usb bus on the machine it is connected to
it is a little on the slow side for reading and writing of data due to its age , but will work if you have zip disks that you still need to use
buy it used
usb flash and cd r/w storage effective killed these products in the marketplace
i had some old files i needed to get access to and a stack of zip <NUM> and zip <NUM> disks that were the best candidates
a couple of desktops ago i had an internal zip drive , and had been been lugging that machine around from place to place in case i needed it
finally i opted to let that machine go to free up space , so recently when i decided to move those files onto newer storage i had to pick up a drive
i was very surprised to see that the price for one of these drives is still well over $100 new in 2014
the device i bought was a little under $40 new after shipping was added on , for about an hour of two or use
it gets three stars for being adequate , if outdated , technology
recommend to borrow the drive if you can find a person who has one , or else buy it used .
we were able to complete our project with this zip drive
it worked well for us .
the zip <NUM> is perhaps the most rational choice for anyone looking to bridge the gap between macintosh and windows based machines
in both the scsi and usb forms , it invites portability
it is the ideal solution for anyone who creates anything but video on one platform for use on the other
( for video editing , a jaz drive is more appropriate
) it is also great if you are living on a budget
though your initial purchase is more expensive than buying a zip 100 , you will spend far less on disks
since 250mb disks are essentially the same price as 100mb ones , your overall storage costs will be cheaper in the long term
perhaps more importantly , you won not have to abandon your existing zip library to upgrade
the product is much vaunted backwards compatibility with zip 100s is real and mostly trouble free
the only glitch with it is that if you are trying to save large ( over 15mb ) files to a zip 100 , it will take painfully--longer than if you were using a zip <NUM> drive
for many people , this won not be a consideration
but if you have large multimedia files in your 100mb disk library , you might consider transferring them over to 250mb disks
to put it simply , i definitely wouldn not recommend either version of this product if you plan to use only 100mb disks
the real question , though , is whether you should get the scsi or the usb version
out of the box , the scsi external is twice as fast as the usb , but less portable
to use the scsi version , you have got to have scsi cards installed in every machine on which you are going to use the drive
virtually no computers , pc or mac , come with scsi cards , so you will immediately have to spend money to bring your computer ( s ) up to speed
and you will have to deal with the fact that most unknown computers won not have a scsi card
meanwhile , the entirely more portable usb version , though slower by default , can be brought up to the same speed as the scsi
with the addition of a firewire adaptor , there is no difference between the two drives
all macs since the g3 , and an increasing number of pcs come with firewire
and if you happen to encounter a computer without firewire , you can easily remove the adaptor and go back to the default usb isn not exactly "slow" , anyway
with either form , you are going to have to spend some more money to get both top speeds *and* portability
if you don not plan to travel outside computers you already know have scsi capability , it is probably cheaper to go with a scsi zip
but if you want the fastest , zip drive that you can use on the highest percentage of computers , buy a usb zip 250 , and add on a firewire adaptor .
iomega zip <NUM> parallel port drivethis device allows both storage and transfer and works on any or epp parallel port
for best results , you should run the "parallel port accelerator" program when the unit is connected
computers have a limit on the number of ide devices , and desktop computers have a limited number of bays
the disks are easily replaced to provide vast storage within the 250mb limit
this device must be connected when all power is off , like a parallel port printer
backing up a small amount of data is not a problem , but large amount of data files will run slowly
the fastest transfer is with an internal ide zip device
most printers will operate from the printer port on the back
the <NUM> mb unit can read and write the more popular 100mb disks as well
the "user is manual" warns against using the operating system to copy a disk
use the iomega "copy machine" program
right click on the zip drive to select the iomega "format" function
use "short format" to delete all data on an iomega disk
the "long format" repairs a drive with errors , converts from another format , or removes all passwords
"write protection" protects against writing over data , a password can protect against both reading and writing files
you can also flag the zip drive as "" so it appears like a hard drive
the manual has the details
the manual offers suggestions if this doesn not work
parallel port drives have their drive letters assigned after the hard drives
another parallel port unit can be connected to the first ( "daisy chaining" )
this changes the drive letters assigned to
will the data on a disk survive for over a decade ? few hard drives survive <NUM> years of daily use
all your important data files should be copied from a hard drive to zip drives or other media
zip drives , like floppies , should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat
cds can be damaged by high heat
zip disks are reusable , replacing data does not decrease the size
a cd disk consumes space when a file is replaced
a zip disk never has compatibility problems between different systems and computers
a cd written on one system may not be updated by a different system
to test the status of a used zip disk
1 ) right click on the drive , select `properties'
2 ) select the iomega tab ( after support was installed )
3 ) select `diagnostics' , then `close' after the green light
4 ) select `more info' on the `disk type' note the `disk life status' and the `format life status'
percentages lower than about <PERCENT> are not good
5 ) a `long format' can improve the life status statistics
if your system does not recognize your used parallel port drive ( add new hardware wizard ) , select the hardware from the list : "scsi controllers" , "iomega" , "iomega parallel port interface" , then "finish"
you should set the printer port as epp or ecp
then modify the isettings' for the iomega parallel port interface as follows
the port settings assumes the usual i/o address
'my computer' ; 'properties' ; isystem devices' ; 'device manager' ; iscsi controllers' ; 'iomega parallel port interface' ; 'properties' ; isettings'/mode : eppecr /port : 378 /speed : 6
what is good about this zip drive is that it is very easy to install , and requires basically no configuration , just plug in , and install the software
the one thing i don not like about it is it sometimes freezes up your computer while you are backing up files
i mean you don not have to restart the computer or anything , you just can not do anything else for a couple minutes
sometimes that can be a pain
all in all though , its still a good product .
i received my zip drive about four years ago when i began developing powerpoints that exceeded <NUM> megs
it was a great storage medium at the time and the portability of the drive was very helpful
i then bought a two years ago and haven not touched my zip drive since
the drives give you all the storage flexibility of the zip drives but they store more data ( unless you purchase the <NUM> gig zip drive ) , they are cheaper , and more portable and can work across platforms
i can backup my files on a cd and copy them onto another computer
i can create discs of my mp3 files to play back on this or other computers
in the end , it simply is easier to burn a cd and use it on another computer
for example - some time ago i helped a friend of mine put together a presentation on a medical case he had
with all the digitized pictures and cat scans , the power point and graphic files exceed several megs - too many for a floppy
i could have given him a zip disk and my zip drive but he would have had to connect the drive to his computer , install the software , and then copy the files over
instead , i burned him a cd with the powerpoint and all supporting files
he simply placed it into the presentation computer and was using it <NUM> seconds later
it doesn not get much easier than that
zip drives are seing the end of their days
i would suggest looking at the zip cd is and the if you are considering purchasing a zip drive .
i bought this a long time ago
it was my first zip drive , which i don not have anymore
it was a very good drive and it lasted a long time
i now have a <NUM> mb zip drive .
my zip <NUM> suffered from the "click of death" and i lost about five disks and the whole drive before i learned on the internet about this problem
i gave iomega my email address when i registered my drive but they didn not tell me that using their defective drives ruins the disk with loss of all data
but , i had to get my data off , so i bought a zip <NUM> and today i had the click of death again with total loss of data and a ruined expensive disk
arrggh ! needless to say , i would never recommend a zip drive and i am planning on forever boycotting iomega
and , if you happen to run into a zip drive engineer who designed this turkey , please give him or her a ( gentle ) dope slap for me
who at iomega thought this piece of engineering garbage was suitable for valuable data ? ( if you are tempted to by a zip , anyway , search for "click of death"
before buying a zip drive
i wonder how many countless gigabytes of data have been lost ? )
why zip disks were ever popular , i will never know
they are one of the most unreliable , and most expensive forms of data storage i have ever seen
except for the jaz drive , which happens to be made by the same company
if you want to store a lot of data for the least amount of money , then go out and buy a cd writer , especially if your media is going to be well traveled ! i work for a print company in the electronic department , and i also have a small web design business , and i cannot tell you how many times i have gotten a zip disk that has gone bad while it was being delivered to me
i have never had a problem with cds corrupting , sure i have had some cds that don not work , but that happened during the writing , not because of the way it was stored , or shipped
save me , you , and everyone else a huge headache by switching to .
nice little box
performed faultlessly the four or five years it was connected to my two ugly beige boxes
switched between windows and linux without failure
what more could you ask ? epilogue : got rid of the two ugly beige boxes and retired this gadget , but still give it full points .
i wanted to buy linksys is &quot ; compact&quot ; kvm switch , because i thought the case looked cooler , and i wanted to be able to switch between pcs by pressing my ctrl key twice
however , one of my two pcs uses a serial mouse and at keyboard , so i had to get this one ( which includes one set of adapters ) instead , because the &quot ; compact&quot ; switch only supports ps2 mice and keyboards
much to my surprise , it uses the same keyboard hotkey as the compact switch ( although i never saw that feature advertised anywhere )
because of this , i was able to drop the switch ( which really isn not very big at all ) behind my desk , out of sight -- i never have to touch it ! if there is any degradation to my screens , i can not tell .
great product and price
works as advertised
running an xp tower and a windows <NUM> tower
grab one while you can
i have a feeling a kvm switch will be hard to find .
i get the linksysy kvm , and the first time it , work great in a compaq proliat running windows <NUM> server and in compaq presario running linux red hat 7
but when i restart the linux bos for th first time , the mouse din not came back , it was really crazy , making stranges moves , but i resolve the problem edint this two filesfile path /etc/x11/xf86configi changed the section entitled &quot ; section &quot ; pointer&quot ; &quot ; and the line below to : protocol &quot ; imps/2&quot ; file path /etc/x11/ changed the section entitled &quot ; section &quot ; inputdevice&quot ; &quot ; and the line below to : option &quot ; protocol&quot ; &quot ; imps/2&quot ; this solved both the erratic mouse pointer problem and enabled scrolling .
i have been using a kvm switch for over <NUM> years with a linux and windows box and i thought it was just the best way to go
i have gone thru two analog switches ( the ones with the tangle of wires inside ) and i bought a bunch of cables
i originally bought cheap monitor cables but the ghosting was terrible
my old system worked fine at 1024x768 except occasionally it would lose the keyboard but the fix was to simply reinsert the keyboard plug
i recently started working with a much larger monitor ( running 1600x1024 under windows , 1600x1200 under linux ) and my old setup just couldn not handle the video bandwidth ; the ghosting was terrible
so after checking out the reviews here i thought i'd give this one a try
its great
there might be a tiny bit of ghosting , but its too hard to say if its just the monitor itself
the only problem i have noticed , is that i can not get the mouse to work well under linux/x windows
for some reason the resolution of the mouse just isn not great so the motion is a bit jerky
but its a small problem albeit annoying
the keyboard toggle between pcs works flawlessly and i have never lost the mouse or keyboard and the video is always centered ( although thats probably a function of the monitor )
if you are using two pcs or a laptop and a pc this product is worth its weight in gold ( its very light , as its sold state not the clunkly switch of old : )
the cost effectiveness of this item is superior
occasionally the double tap of the ctrl button does not work , but that is easily solved by pressing the button on the box
the cables were of good quality and color coded for today is pc is
only drawback is that it is not expandable .
it is true
i am a chronically unorganized person
my office is a mess , my desk is a mess , and my schedule
well we won not even talk about that
fortunately , one aspect of my life has become a little easier to manage thanks to my brand spanking new palm vx
until recently , i didn not really see the use in a pda but when others in my office began raving about theirs , i took a leap of faith and bought a vx
what is it ? essentially , the palm vx is the high end ( ) organizer offered by palm
the vx is capable of managing your calendar , email , task list , address book and offers a whole host of other capabilities through software
the vx has a sleek , silver aluminum case that offers more protection than the traditional plastic case
in addition , the vx has a slim design that is nearly half the width of many of the other pdas on the market
how can it organize my life ? first , get rid of that bulky franklin planner ! the vx can store everything you would typically store without all that paper mess
need to make a note ? write it in the vx is notepad
need to check your schedule ? check it out in the vx is scheduler
just about the only thing you can not do with a vx that you could do with a franklin is doodle ( and i probably just haven not figured out how to do that yet )
how easy is it to install it ? installing the vx is relatively easy
just connect the cradle to a serial port on the back of your computer , pop in the cd and run the setup
the palm desktop software setup walks you through the process in about <NUM> minutes
be careful , however , if you are going to use outlook for your email client
in order to use outlook , you have to have the pocketmirror software installed ( it comes with the palm cd )
when the setup asks you if want to setup your pda to read email , click the button that says "learn more about using microsoft outlook"
this will setup the pocketmirror conduit and enable your vx to read and send email through outlook
. well , as i mentioned above , you get sleek looking pda that replaces your traditional planner
on top of that , however , you get rechargeable nicad batteries which are a must for anyone who uses their pda a lot
there is nothing more irritating than to have your aa batteries die in the middle of a meeting
also , you get a nice looking leather cover , which i promptly replaced with a bodyglove neoprene cover for $20
i wanted the extra protection and i liked the ability to hold business cards in my pda case
what are the downsides ? the first downside is lack of expandability
although you are able to connect a modem for mobile access , i don not like the fact that you can not add more memory or modules such as mp3 players , digital cameras or any of the other modules offered for the handspring
apparently , palm realized that i was not the only person who feels this way because the new generation of palm pdas ( the m500 series ) offer memory expansion slots and additional modules
although it doesn not mater all that much to me , i guess some would consider the lack of color to be a downside
although i did consider the palm iiic when looking at pdas i chose to go with the smaller , lightweight model rather than the bulkier model that offered color
i don not miss having color so it is not really that big of a downside
the only other downside i see is the fact that the cradle shipped with the pda runs off a serial port instead of a usb
although i don not notice a big difference in the time it takes to sync , i would like to know that as serial port becomes more outdated , i can continue to use my pda
overalli am really impressed with my vx
i have been using it for a couple of months now and have nothing but praise for it
the batteries hold their charge for quite a long time , the sync process is relatively quick , and the organizer itself has attracted a lot of comments
if you are considering a pda , i would definitely take a look at the vx
it is well worth the money .
great little device ; it has helped organize my life tremendously
on top of that , it scores the cool points
the only drawback is the price , but that was easily outweighed by the sleek , sturdy design and <NUM> mb of ram .
what can i say ? the palm vx , for the money , is the best pda you can buy
it syncs flawlessly with my work win2k laptop and my home desktop mac
its reliable , the battery life is fantastic , and with 8mb of ram , i find it more than enough for all my games , books and apps ! my suggestion , skip the palm <NUM> and save yourself $
the palm vx is everything the palm <NUM> is and maybe even more ! who needs the secure expansion slot anyway ?
tengo <NUM> meses de utilizar una palm vx , mantengo toda la informacion de mi agenda diaria , a la mano , es muy confiable y rapida , nunca he tenido problema de perdida de informacion o cualquier otro tipo de problemas
considero una muy buena eleccion comprarse una .
i bought my palm iiixe before this , and had always complained about the size
it works great and all but i just want to have a little machine that i don not even feel it when i carry it around
now palm vx does exactly that
it is slim sexy design is well worth the money
rechargable internal battery means you don not have to worry about changing batteries every month or so and can feel free to use the backlight
: ) as for functions , it is basically the same as all palm iii series
<NUM> mb of ram , palm os 3
5 , things like that
you'd probably be using the normal functions like calendar , phone book , notepad , task list more often
for me i use it to read chinese books and have a list of important emails backed up on my palm .
i use my palm v as an address book , calendar and list , with a few digital notes
i also have the dooney &amp ; bourke palm v case and the palm travel kit
the palm v is sleek and attractive , but has a few major flaws : 1
the on button is not protected from being constantly activated by the case , causing the batteries to drain extremely fast
the flimsy cover that it comes with is not sufficient
everybody that i know that has a palm , bought an additional case
the original case should at least be usable
the reset button does not clear memory , forcing me to wait for the batteries to die to clear it
no bulk delete option is provided
there is no usb option provided with the basic palm for synching with usb devices
the rechargeable battery is nice if you don not leave your cradle for more than a week , but nasty if you travel
in short , the palm v has potential , but some simple design flaws and the need to buy a number of just to make it functional are simply unacceptable at that price tag
for my needs , i am going to the rex 6000
it is far less expensive , much more portable , and provides both usb and pcmcia synching out of the box .
weighing in at just 4oz
, it has the same anodized aluminum exterior and lcd screen as the palm vx handheld
yet it has four times the memory of its predecessor , giving you more speed and more storage
now , no matter how busy your life gets , you can keep it together in style
keep all your meeting times , places , people , phone numbers and other information safely tucked away in this elegant device
8mb of memory stores up to 10 , 000 addresses , <NUM> years of appointments , 3 , 000 items , 3 , 000 memos , <NUM> messages , plus , there is plenty of room for extra applications , books , language translators , image viewers , dictionaries , games , advanced calculators , and more
use the hotsync cradle to quickly backup and exchange information between your pc and your palm handheld , as well as any number of popular pims like symantec act ! and microsoft outlook
lithium ion batteries recharge themselves in the hotsync cradle in just minutes a day
a full charge lasts up to a month
optional recharging kit available for road warriors

items included in the boxpalm vx handheld , palm desktop software , applications for palm vx handheld , rechargeable battery ( internal ) , adapter , getting started guide , <NUM> stylii , protective leather cover , handbook , hotsync cradle , adapter/recharger
a great advancement in the realm of the palm pilot , this unit is far more durable than the iii or the vii series .
i liked this device for a long time but gave up using it years ago
since then i haven not used a stylus but miss that aspect
i haven not seen anybody using a palm device in a long time and don not recommend buying one now
however , anybody that wants one of these palmone devices can try out a used one at a reasonable price .
the money that i put down for my palm vx is some of the best i have ever spent
prior to my palm vx , i had a separate address book and calendar and lists and notes everywhere , all of which ended up getting lost or being in entirely different places when i needed them most
as a result , i often forgot to do things that needed to be done , lost important phone numbers , etc
-you get the idea
my palm vx changed everything
now i keep everything important , from the standard addresses , to do is , notes , and appointments to my accounting info , stock portfolio , and local movie times ( thanks to avantgo
com ) all on my palm vx , and it is great ! a warning to those buying palm v is , though
it takes time to get used to it ! i hated grafiti ( the &quot ; handwriting&quot ; you must use for the palm to recognize your input ) at first , and found the miniscule keyboard a pain
additionally , i saw no real point in keeping a to do list and all my appointments on the thing
after a month of forcing myself to do so , however , i was hooked ! after really taking the time to get familiar with the thing , i use it on the order of twenty times a day--far more than i have used any other device ( digital or pen and paper )
so , my buying advice : buy one ! palm vx is are absolutely fantastic , really ! they are beautifully designed ( you won not feel geeky pulling one out ! ) and the handiest things in the world
i promise ! ( be sure to buy a hard case to keep it nice
i had a mishap with my palm v during a softball game where the palm was pretty well destroyed
i was more than a little concerned as i had a date in a couple days and the only place i had the girl is phone number and address was on my palm ( i was lax in doing my daily hotsync )
so , with some fear , i put my badly dented palm into the hotsync cradle and pressed the big button on the front
some whirring and clicking and it still synced
that says a lot for the construction quality of this pda .
last year , i helped my cousin install his palm v to work with his desktop
thought it was a neat device but , did not want to buy one for myself at the time ; thinking that my laptop was good enough for what i need to do
stupid decision ! i finally bought myself a palm vx this august and it has changed the way i use and access information on the move
it is forte is dependable connectivity and it does that so well
the vx ships with chapura pocketmirror , which an excellent sync/conduit manager , optimised for outlook users ( ) and is a breeze to set up
pocketmirror integrates seamlessly with palm is own desktop manager - just follow the instructions and you will be able to hotsync all your data in outlook , literally within minutes
the vx also ships with avantgo , which is perfect for those of you who want to browse your favourite websites and on the move ( it syncs with your chosen sites every time you ; just a push of a button away )
there is no point dwelling on the number of addresses , memos , etc
that the vx can store , since these are pretty much the industry standard with other brands too and realistically , it is unlikely that you will ever run out of space for these items
the 8mb in the vx comes in handy when you use applications such as avantgo and if you tend to keeps hundreds of messages in your outlook inbox ( like i do ! )
i have recently added documents to go ( [
] a 3rd party
this software brings word and excel files into my vx and now , i no longer have to use my laptop for every important document or spreadsheet i need to access quickly in a meeting or whilst on the phone - it is all there in the palm of my hand ( pun intended ) ! if i had a palm wish , i guess a colour version of the vx would be the ultimate ; though , knowing the folks at palm , this is probably around the corner ( since they have already released a colour version of the iii series - the iiic )
i guess i would also like to have my isent items' mailbox from outlook in my palm - there probably is software available somewhere on the net which does this , but i haven not found it as yet
spend the money on a palm vx , you prospective pda shoppers ! you will not regret it !
i bought the palm vx as my first palm pilot and it is worth every cent i paid for it
it may not have as many features as the new ones , like a color screen , expansion slot , or bluetooth compatibility , but it is inexpensive and very reliable
it is run downloaded applications smoothly and with no trouble
it is got plenty of memory ( 8mb ) , a rechargeable battery , and is thin and light
it is even better when you add accessories like the palm portable keyboard or the travel charger
if you are looking for a basic palm pilot for a surprisingly inexpensive price , this is for you .
the palm vx is a great pda for three reasons
first , it is compatible with the wireless omnisky service , which will allow to check time sensitive and check to see if your flight is delayed
i am a road warrior , so this is a big plus since it can let me know if i have time to relax a little longer before waiting around at the gate for the plane to permit boarding
second , it has a great form factor
for those of you who have never owned a pda before , the form factor gets important over time
you may think that it isn not important , but anyone who needs a pda needs it to be small
if this wasn not the case , try lugging around a heavy laptop and you will know what i mean
third , and perhaps the most important reason is that this is compatible with all palm applications
i know there are other pdas that are not palm but use the palm os , such as handspring , and the sony cle , but some apps do not work unless you have a geniune palm
for example , dinkypad doesn not scroll in handspring , but it does so on an original palm
also , when you buy a palm , you can be sure that the upgrades to the os that palm releases will be compatible
the only negative thing i have to say about the vx is that it doesn not go as fast as the handspring platinum or prism , since they have the newer motorola processor .
if you begin to use this as an organizer -- address and calender -- it puts the dissheveld life in shape
but when start taking notes , downloading databases , restaurant and movies listings it changes everything
this becomes the friendly resource it should be -- reminder of things and rememberer of others -- what time does that store close ? given the sync capabilities with services -- vindigo and avantgo -- there not as much additional value in the vii
all movies listings are current , most key phone numbers handy , etc
the extra memory does come in handy as you enthusiasm baloons
i do recommend an additional case that is a little more protective .
alright , for those of you who know my reviews ( as few as there may be )
i am always as honest as physically possible
to begin , lets start off with the style
its incredible ! i picked up the palm hardcase ( yes yes , i know it isn not all aluminum
but it looks nice and gives it more protection than it would have otherwise )
this palm is a pure head turner compaired to their earlier models
small , sleek , and rechargable ! i have owned this palm for over two years now
not a single problem with the rechargable battery
i was cautious about this
but i get a nice charge from it , and it lasts for quite a long amount of use
palm software is easy to use and easy to install
secondly , the palm obviously runs palm os
to this day , it has never given me any problems
no crashing or anything windowsce related
this unit has a b&amp ; w display , and even though many of you probably would rather go with a color one
the pricetag is just too high
also , i find the b&amp ; w display much easier on the eyes than the glaring/bright color display
the only bad thing that i can think of is the backlit display
simply put , it is of no use unless you are in absolute darkness
this is a flaw that was fixed on the backlighting on the new m100 series and on
so if your considering a palm pilot , look to the palm vx ! with <NUM> megs of storage space , its plenty of room for ebooks , gps systems , or anything you can throw at it
i'd also recommend getting the for this palm
keeps it staying like new and reduces any glare you may get off of the screen in bright/glaring locations ! i fully recommend this product to students and professionals alike !
i have recently bought a palm vx and i love it
compared to my old way of keeping track of all my appointments and contacts it is a godsend
it was easy to install the software and the hardware , taking no longer that <NUM> minutes
as for the palm handheld itself it is very easy to use
if care to spend about hour playing with it you don not even need the manual its all very straightforward
the hotsync worked great with my microsoft outlook
another feature of the vx is the rechargeable battery
although this can be a great convenience , it can also be a hindrance
if you are traveling you have to take a charger
this is the only shortfall that i see from this product
furthermore i would highly recommend this to anyone .
i love my palm vx
i thought of buying the m500 but decided not to due to the cost and not currently being supported by omnisky wireless
i like the m500 is screen better than the palm vx but not enough to justify the extra $100
as of now i didn not see any need for the expansion slots but i am sure over time there will be a number of usefull extras that come on the expansion cards
overall i am pleased with the palm vx and would recommend it to anyone .
this handheld is made with great quality ! i myself had a palm m105 which has very similar stats
the palm vx is so much better made and the rechargible battery is awesome ! i would recomend this to anybody who needs to get organized or just likes to play games in school or work !
i have used a palm v since they where out in the market
now i just bought a hp jornada <NUM> and been wondering when we are going to have a device so powerful and nice looking as those powered with pocket pc
i am not talking about the color , i am talking on a device that can hold mission critical applications and tools for developing professional modules that can interact with bar code readers , gps , and radiofrecuency data interchange
this keeps palm is &quot ; ? &quot ; in the &quot ; what is going on with you ? &quot ; apparel
i must recognize that palm vx size it amasing and very convenient if you like to carry it on your shirt pocket
i hope that i did not make this purchase recently
i had this device - in the early 1990 is
it was pretty cool then .
great product
easy to use ; data transfers quickly from computer
rechargeable batteries have a very long life , and recharged quickly , making travel a breeze
handy combination recharge/synch cradle runs on 110v
suggested improvement would be to make this a combination 110/220v charger
the palm vx is a winner .
i thought it would be helpful to make another review <NUM> months after using my vx instead of a few days just to give a more objective perspective on the utility of the device once the novelty and the excitement of a new toy has passed away
hardware : after <NUM> months , i would have figured that palm or handspring or even sony would have come out with a pda that could rival the vx is elegance and style
unfortunately ( or fortunately , depending on where you are standing ) none has come close
another pleasant surprise is the durability of my vx
although i can not speak for all vx is out there , mine has survived quite horrific spills
there are few hardware hitches with the vx but nothing that i would take away anything from its obvious beauty and durability
there is one other issue that i must address
initially i thought having a built in rechargeable lithium battery instead of the aaa batteries would be a clear advantage
however i have discovered that its not the case
for the vx to be that thin it had to adopt rechargeable lithium batteries
although one might think that a rechargeable battery is better than aaa , you better be prepared to charge your palm at least every three days
software : no matter what the pocketpc boasts of its capabilities , if it lacks third party application support , then how useful can it really be ? similar to windows ce or even the other pda operating systems , the pocket pc could die a slow and painful death because of this lack of support
this is the real strength of the palm os
<NUM> months ago there were thousands of third party applications with hundreds more being added monthly
unfortunately because of this flood of applications , some applications may have unknown effects on our units
although many result to a soft resets , there are instances when a hard reset ( complete data loss ) is required to fix the problem
sometimes there are instances when certain applications won not work with the presence of others
again these are unusual circumstances and it certainly wouldn not deter me from getting a palm os unit again
overall i guess by know you have guessed that im still in love with my vx
i have many applications on my palm but my personal favorites are ; for regular applications there are fireviewer and avantgo and documents to go , for games there are dope wars v 2
3 , irbattleship , pacman , spacetrader , and yahdice and for utility programs there is atools , benchmark , hackmaster and cruise
in terms of accessories i recommend getting the palm hardcase
check out my review on this product
there are hardier cases out there like rhinoskins and concept kitchens , but this one is my favoritespeaking of concept kitchen , i also recommend using their writeright product
its a protective film that goes over the screen
not only does it protect your palm screen from scratches and reduces glare , it has a pen to paper feel when using a stylus
speaking of stylus , you can just forget about the stock stylus of the palm
its [
] ! if you want to get carpal tunnel in <NUM> minutes go for it
otherwise i recommend using another instrument
i recommend using those that have a stylus , pen and pencil in one
there are many great pens out there that have already incorporated styli in their line
cross makes one the is pen on one side and a stylus on the other
pilot makes some nice ones , lamy and rotring makes them too
i personally use the rotring matte black
its a converted pen so i had to buy a stylus refill and replaced the red pen option with the stylus
unfortunately it hasn not been a completely smooth <NUM> months
just recently i had a strange experience of my address book being completely wiped out ! it existed on my desktop but it wouldnt sync to my palm
after a little reinstallation of the desktop application and consultation with the palm technical support , i was able to fix the problem
which brings me to the point of hotsyncing
it is critical that you hotsync
i must say that although it is not necessary to running your palm , a computer is essential to back up files and to install programs
get backup buddy as well
that works really well
hotsync , hotsync , hotsync ! the vx is a good investment
with the m500 and m505 soon to come out , that should decrease its price considerably
although i'd be inclined to recommend the m505 , the [vx is price] is a steal ! last thing , before you go and buy your pda i strongly recommend you do your research
i cant stress it enough
read what people have to say about their experiences and thoughts about their units
consumers are the best sources of objective reviews
good luck people and more power to palm .
the palm vx is really a
small footprint , great connectivity to the pc and to mail programs like outlook
many , many applications written for it , some shareware , some you can purchase
easy synchronization via the cradle interface , which is also the recharging unit
here are the pros : small , lightweight , fits in a shirt pocket
standard os that is widely used
loooooooong battery life
plenty of memory for most application
( 8mb ) plenty of peripherals like a sexy little keyboard , a combo ballpoint , travel adapter kits , car battery charger , ir exchange which works quite well
cons : it is fragile
even in the brushed steel folding case i bought , the screen broke when it slipped from my hand
it is palm os , which means it doesn not have the advantages of the pocket pc ( former windows ce ) os to run powerpoint , ( there is a new program for the pocket pc that lets you view and hear powerpoint
) it doesn not have color display
the screen font could be clearer ( there are better ones on other pda is ) the telephone and wireless stuff isn not in it ( that is either the palm vii with wireless or other brands
) no mp3 player , no voice recorder
and the battery pack is not removable , although it lasts plenty long
should you buy it ? if you want an organizer and email reader , this is excellent
it is what i use every day
the long battery life is a real boon to the traveler
it packs a lot for the money
the optional accessories are priced too high , but this is a complaint against the industry in general
you buy the basic unit , but to add some useful , you can rack a significant percentage of the purchase price in no time .
i have owned a few palm pilots over the past several years
i switched to the palm vx because my palm iii gave out after months of abuse riding in my back pocket
the vx is solidly built , very reliable and never needs batteries
i use mine heavily and sometimes forget to recharge it in the cradle
i have found that the battery lasts about three weeks with heavy use as long as you don not use the backlight
i now use my palm vx with my laptop running windows <NUM> and synchronize my data using the infrared port
the cradle is just a charge stand for me ! if you are nervous about buying this product
relax ! i teach computer skills to executives in the chicago area
the learning curve for palm devices is about <NUM> minutes
there is a shorthand called &quot ; graffiti&quot ; that you will need to learn to write in your information , but you can also use your computer or a separately available keyboard to enter in your data
newer and more powerful palm devices have been introduced since i bought mine , but the vx is an excellent value now that the price has dropped
and it is still the smallest ! if you are looking for a pda to handle your personal and business information and do not need to display color photos , videos or play mp3s , the palm vx is perfect .
i love my palm vx
i put alarms for all my meetings , appointments , my daughter is school functions , birthdays etc
i make notes on things that need to be done and my phone directory is always with me
the only improvements i hope will be made is that phone functions will be added and the calendar can show a week or month of appointments at once .
the palm v is the second palm product that i have owned
( after purchasing a palm pro and experiencing numerous problems , i upgraded to the v , hoping to salvage my large database of entered addresses
) and , for the second time , i am extremely disappointed with the palm products
both palm devices displayed the same problems , specifically : ( 1 ) after a few months of ownership , the screen response begins to fail , requiring almost daily recalibrations of the digitizer ; ( 2 ) many attempted recalibrations of the digitizer simply fail , because the screen become so far out of alignment , that the user can not enter necessary menu selections to even request a digitization ; ( 3 ) attempted full device resets become impossible , since repeated full resets begin to no longer properly reset the device ; ( 4 ) as the screen begins to fail , the ability to enter keystrokes in the graffiti language begins to decrease , forcing a user to rely on the screen is slow and tiny &quot ; qwerty&quot ; keyboard ; and ( 5 ) the operating system still lacks simple security , such as permitting a user to set the device to automatically power off with a password lock ( if a user wants a security , a user has to step through several screen strokes in order to explicitly shut the device off with a password
no automated lock is available on power down ) .
i have had my palm vx since late 2006
i am still using it today , june 2009
i would love to now upgrade to a color palm
however , i am very fearful that i will not find another pda which offers the durability and longevity i have received from my current palm
i will continue to use my palm vx until it dies - permanently .
with less and less time to remember dates , times , and special occasions , the palm vx is a handy gadget
has a whopping <NUM> mb of memory , which should be sufficient even with a ton of games ; ) forgetting names , numbers , and addresses will be a fad of the past
there are tons of applications on the internet that you can download and use , which help save time and make this already handy tool even more useful
you can also 'beam' files and your business card to other pda users as well as laptop users via the fast infared port which allows for wireless transfers
great buy !
i bought my husband a palm in march as an early father is day present and after watching how it changed his life i decided to get one for myself
the palm organizes my life
i am a working mom and i have got a zillion things to keep track of
the appointment book is great , i can set alarms for myself and make sure i don not forget the kids piano lesson or that meeting with the school board
the address book keeps track of everyone i need to , and organizes them into various categories that i can define ( personal , business , pta volunteers , whatever
) there is simply a ton of shareware that can be downloaded , from games for the kids to professional productivity apps , from spreadsheets to flat file databases , from medical billing codes to exercise schedule trackers
anything you can think of is most likely available
the part i like the best is not only can i synch the palm with my own laptop ( including email and news websites ) but i can also beam things back and forth with my husband
that way he knows where i am going to be and i know where he is going to be
no more scribbled notes on the kitchen calendar for us ! and the palm desktop software can have so we can even synch to each other is computer if we like , rather than beaming individual items
all in all this little piece of hardware is one of the best purchases i have made in years
the only thing it needs is a case to hold a business card or two , but those are available all over for purchase from third parties
if you have been thinking of getting one of these , don not hesitate , go for it !
i have owned both a palm vx and iiic ( my current model ) and they are great products
although i have had my iiic for almost a year , and my vx for <NUM> months before that , i am still just as amazed at how useful it is as when i first bought it
these devices are not toys
they will help you organize you life in a way you would never had thought possible , and i am still thinking of new ways to use all the time
i just noticed something interesing about my palm and thought i'd mention it here
a minute ago i put my palm in its cradle to do a hot sync
i pushed the button but nothing happened
i tried it again but again nothing
then i noticed there was a reminder notice on the screen
i cleared it by tapping the &quot ; okay&quot ; button , and after that i was able to hot sync
apparently the palm os considers a reminder notice to be at a lower interrupt level than a hot sync , which , if you think about it , is probably true , since you wouldn not want to miss a reminder notice because it got blown away by the hot sync screen
just one more thing that shows how and thought out these little gadgets are
one other thing
i also have a compaq ipaq , which i also have become very attached to , in addition to my palm
although the ipaq hot sync process is a little easier than the palm ( you just put it in the cradle and the unit is automatically detected , you don not have to hit a button as with the palm ) , the palm does have one advantage here
i can hot sync when i am dialed in and with the modem in use
the ipaq uses a usb port , which looks for a free com port to work with , and this conflicts with the modem
when i try to hot sync while using the modem , i get a message that there is a conflict and it won not hot sync
this is despite the fact that my system has two com ports and the microsoft windows diagnostics shows the second com port as free and not in use
however , one interesting thing the ipaq does is you can work with it while it is hot synching
you still can not do that for the palms .
the time arrived for me to upgrade from my trusty old palm v
i was running short on memory , so that left the palm iiic , vx and jornada <NUM> for consideration
i tried the iiic for a month
found the color screen a pleasure to work with
there are not that many 3rd party apps in color yet , but that appears to be changing fast
i liked the tinysheet excel compatible spreadsheet in color
the black on white screen is very readable for
battery life was acceptable
on a <NUM> week business trip i had to recharge it only once
the downside for me is size , the comfort factor
you can not comfortably carry a palm in a shirt pocket
i carry it in my pants pocket , with the v i would forget i had it until i needed it
the iiic , it was just always nothere'
the only other gripe i have is that it is almost impossible to read the screen outside
something i took for granted on the monochrome v
bright daylight however fully washes out color screens
i really like the small updates to the new palmos
the little shortcut bar that appears at the bottom of the screen for menu shortcuts is an excellent innovation
it makes cutting and pasting as fast as with the pc using the keyboard
i used the jornada for <NUM> weeks before i returned it
as my expectations weren not that high from my previous exposure to the platform i can not say that i was dissappointed
however , i still don not think ms is up to par
on the balance still more 'clicks' are needed than on a palm
i couldn not find those easy to use 3rd party freeware apps such as the ny crossstreet finder , on pocketpc
on face value i liked excel , but i found it is small differences with the pc version annoying
knowing one , i made assumption about the other that didn not always pan out
the high resolution of the screen is nice
for the jornada would be good , if not for the poor passive matrix screen
for example , on the plane , i could put the iiic on the tray in front of me , and read at an angle
this is impossible with the jornada screen
for basic pda functions it is adequate
i feel the apps still are a bit sluggish
playing mp3 is is fun , but with <NUM> songs at cd quality , memory is depleted which makes it impracticle for multimedia , unless you spend more to expand memory
forget playing mp3 is in the background while doing other work , the device slows down to a crawl
size wise , the jornada is a bit bigger and heavier than the iiic , which to me is a problem as i already explained
battery life seemed shorter than the iiic , though it may be subjective because it was on a lot , while learning the pocketpc platform
the palm vx is basically a faster palm v with more memory
just got it yesterday and i already love it
this is the one i am keeping
i suppose that after getting used to the size and weight of the palm v , there is no going back
however , i am glad that i went through the hassles of trying out the other <NUM> models
i learned a few things : 1 ) size matters
2 ) until technology for multimedia matures , color screens do not add significant value to justify their impact on size and battery life
3 ) pocketpc looked good on face value , but didn not go the distance , however , i do believe that as technology advances , multimedia such as mp3 playback will be great to have
i hope that by that time palm will have the capability
4 ) 3rd party apps add tremendous value
something i forgot until i couldn not find my favourite little that make life easy , such as accountmanager , cross street finder etc
all in all , the best favor you can do yourself is getting one
got my parents a palm v <NUM> months ago , now i have to get them another one so they stop fighting over it .
when my palm v was stolen last may , i went right out and bought a palm vx to replace it ! upfront , i should address the comment of the reviewer below who complained of losing his data when the device crashed
the palm vx comes with software that allows you to create a copy of all your palm data on your computer
if you lose the palm data for some reason ( or the computer data ) , you can restore the lost data with a couple of mouse clicks
the palm comes with a &quot ; cradle&quot ; that is used for recharging and for linking to the computer
when my palm was stolen , i easily restored my information into my new palm vx
the process of storing data takes about <NUM> seconds , and literally just takes a button push after you have put your palm in the cradle
i should mention that in <NUM> months of extensive use , i have never &quot ; lost&quot ; my data due to software failure
i did lose it when my palm was stolen of course , but was easily able to replace it
i find two main uses for my palm--as a scheduler , i can enter something i want to be reminded of at a future date , and have the palm alert me at a specified time ( typically five minutes before the meeting starts , for meetings at my work )
you can easily view all the items in place for each day , and there is also a weekly view
this can be done years in advance , and doesn not have to be for work stuff--i have a gasket in an underwater camera which needs to be replaced in may , 2002 , and i have entered a reminder to alert me at that time ! the other thing i use it for is as a way to find &quot ; forgotten&quot ; information
i make and store memos of important conversation or important information
also , i make notes in the &quot ; address book&quot ; of key information about people--things i have discussed with them , or areas of expertise they have
i can use the &quot ; find&quot ; feature on my palm to locate a term
so if i want to know what conversations i have had about widgets , or who i have talked to that knows about widgets , i can enter &quot ; widget&quot ; in the find feature , and i will be shown a list of all my memos that mention widgets in the text , and anyone in my address book who i listed as being ! incidentally , i will also get a list of any appointments in my calendar that mention widgets
if you are a busy person ( and not just a business type , students , or homemakers may benefit as well ) i believe you will be able to make good use of a palm vx
you may be equally satisfied with a handspring , or with other makes of palm , though
the two great advantages i see with the palm vx ( or palm v , if you can still find one ) are that the profile of the device is very slender--it fits in my front slacks pocket without leaving a substantial bulge
second advantage is that the internal battery provides power for a week to two weeks of use , and can be recharged by resting in the cradle
no need to buy replacement batteries , or juggle them around replacing them .
after using a handspring , but going through batteries too quickly , i decided to upgrade to this timeless pda
i have no complaints with it other than the serial sync is a lot slower than the usb sync
i love the battery , metal case , and slim size
i fit this in my pocket and it is a lot lighter than my wallet ; ) now that the m500 discounts have hit , the vx is coming down to very attractive prices .
as an owner of jornada <NUM> and jornada <NUM> pocket pcs and a handspring visor prism i have had ample time to consider which of them is my favorite - and the palm vx wins
what i like - the small size , simplicity , razor sharp screen and ample memory
specifics - this is the smallest of the pdas i own and it is easy to slip into a shirt pocket
however , the feature i most like is the standard palm applications , which do a few tasks well , and the wealth of applications that can be easily downloaded
compared to the pocket pcs i own this and the size combine to make the vx my favorite
although this is the only pda i own that has a monochrome screen the vx is easier to read in all light conditions
why choose a vx ? by any standard this model is obsolete , but is probably the best designed pda on the market - especially if you want a pda instead of the more complicated pocket pc devices - because used ones are attractively priced and it makes an ideal pda
it also may be the only pda for many people because it is rich with functionality ( appointments , calendar , phone list , etc
) , and remains compatible with tens of thousands of readily available programs .
i have owned my palm vx for about a year and a half now
despite the hype over much higher priced units , i still think it is one of the best pdas out there
what i like 1
memory , and lots of it
if <NUM> mb does not sound like a lot , think of what you are using a pda for
there is plenty of room for the phone book and appointment book
that is <PERCENT> of what i use my palm for
i have never run out memory
lots of freeware and cheap shareware
the most useful is the new palm pdf reader from adobe
i can take important documents with me as a pdf and have them as a look up document
other nifty utilities i have picked up include a travel alarm clock with world time zones , ip calculator and some neat games to pass the time
coming on strong are text document readers and databases
good monochrome display with adjustable contrast
sure color on pdas is a hot topic , but from what i have seen , color is not worth it on a pda
the color is poor and it really decreases battery life
built in rechargabe power and long battery life
no hassle with batteries : drop it in the cradle and it recharges
i have gone as long as three weeks without recharging
what i don not like 1
i had to add pocketmirror to synch with outlook
when i upgraded my desktop , the outlook synch was lost until i purchased a new pocketmirror
i have no gripe with the performance , i just wish this was a standard feature 2
no expansion capability
i know i said it has enough memory , but i wish i could add an player or use smartmedia for archive storage
it looks so nice i have to watch out someone dosen not &quot ; adopt&quot ; mine ! pda is are what most people really need when they say they need a laptop
if you really do need portable spreadsheets or data bases and total management capabilities , you *do* need a laptop and no pda is going to fulfill your needs
a pda is a handy electronic version of the old standby appoinment book with some adapatability to other tasks
as for the current crop of hype topics : wireless ? it is a solution in search of a problem
color ? keep it on the big screen where it belongs .
so here is my little tale
i began my whole palm expedition several years ago with a palm professional ( yes , back in the day )
that worked out just fine for the time , but being a gadget junkie , i had to get the palm v when it came out
and can i say how much better it was ? ! ? not only did you not have to deal with batteries , but you didn not have the bulk that the palm pro had
a few other cool things - the cradle that has a place for your stylus
this may not seem like a big thing until you leave you stylus on your desk and go home and realize that you need it
and i never had any problems with the software
so , as it was i was completely happy with my little , stylish palm v
then handspring came out
and i had to have that - for the mp3 player
so i got rid of the palm and got on the waiting list for a little imac colored handspring
i was super excited - more memory and the cool springboard feature seemed like it would be nice
what a disappointment i was in for after having owned the palm v
first of all , my stupid handspring crashed all the time
second , it ate batteries like a hog - where the palm v didn not need batteries because it has the recharable lithium ion battery
third , it is the same bulkiness as the palm pro
fourth , there was no place for the stylus
and last , but definetely not least , the springboard module is turned out to be a joke - the release dates on them kept slipping
i guess part of my problem is being an early adopter - but i sure did miss my palm
so i gave in and did what any gadget junkie would do
i sold the handspring and upgraded to a palm vx
and happy happy happy am i .
i am a busy doctor , a macintosh user , and an avid palm enthusiast
here is my bottom line : if you don not have a palm vx , you have to get one , right now
the address book alone is worth the price of admission , keeping hundreds of names , phone numbers , addresses , and addresses instantly accessible ( and categorizable and keyword searchable ! ) the date book instantly makes obsolete all those little 'pocket organizers'
and the note pad and list are just the thing for jotting this or that
synchronization with a usb mac is seamless and the mac software , based on claris organizer , is quite good
( be sure and buy the 3com palm usb kit ; other 3rd party adapters i tried didn not work
) but where the palm really shines is in the 3rd party software , much of which is free , that is available over the web
epocrates for doctors ( a hypertext drug guide a la the famous pocket pharmacopoeia ) will become your portable brain for drug selection and dosing
and avantgo , a service that allows daily downloading of nearly any web site into your palm , is highly useful ; i use it for news ( general and medical ) , sports scores , current movie showtimes in my area , weather forecasts , and a daily joke
it eases the pain of spending <NUM> hours straight in the hospital
vindigo , a free city guide to restaurants and nightlife , is great but takes too long to sync every day ( adds about <NUM> minutes to a normally <NUM> minute sync ) so i took it off
there are also freeware amusements ( mulg , dopewars , and c
explorer are currently installed on mine ) and electronic books ( victor , adams , and ropper is pocket neurology text , for instance ) that may be of use to you
<NUM> mb is plenty for all of the above - i have <NUM> mb to spare
the batteries recharge overnight in the cradle and last a long , long time
i would offer <NUM> caveats : 1 , mac outlook express won not interface with the nice app ( eudora does , though , if you want to switch
) 2 , you can not just carry the palm around in your pocket
it will fall out onto the floor and the screen will crack
get either the deluxe carrying case or the leather belt case
i have one of each and prefer the belt case for practicality and ; if i was worried about looking professional i might use the deluxe case in my white coat top pocket instead .
i am not a pda junky , but i sure stay very busy and thisdevice is the best christmas gift i have ever had
palm vx has plenty of muscle to cover my everyday needsand keeps me focused in my daily reports plus my own personalagenda
there is the m515 now with 16mb but will you ever use them ? i doubt it .
if you have been doing you are homework on all of the pda is out there now then you probably have heard all about those &quot ; palm&quot ; top computer systems
what i have found that is most disturbing about those palmtops is that they have so much more than you need , are larger , have reduced battery lifes and are about twice as expensive as the wonderous piece of equipment i am reviewing now
the palm vx is the latest and , in my opinion , the greatest palm of all the ones that 3com have produced
using the latest version of the palm os , this device comes loaded with <NUM> megs of ram , a battery that will last up to a month on one charge , enough programs to organize your entire life , and an easy to learn writing technique called graffiti
and although it may not be quite as accurate as on the more expensive pda is , it does the job , and there is also a built in keypad that can be used to input information
syncronization with your computer or laptop is simple too
just place the palm in it is charging station ( which is included ) and hit the hotsync button
all of your days notes , scheduals , information , and whatever is easily backed up to your hard drive
and anything that you add to the computer transfer program will be uploaded to the palm vx
in short , the setup is easy , the programs are user friendly , and did i mention it only weighs <NUM> oz ! also , unlike it is palm bretheren ( mainly the palm iii is ) , which have a hokey plastic casing , this palm has a very sleak magnesium casing that is both stylish and that just feels damn good in your hand
however , it does have it is downsides
for starters , the built in ir ( infrared port ) is almost useless beyond <NUM> inches away which means that the transfer function between two palms , although nice , isn not very useful in most real world situations
hell you can not even beam a signal across and empty room
second , unlike it is cousin , the visor , which was produced by the company who had the original idea for the palm , it has no extra memory slot and therefore cannot have extra memory added to it
however , since there is not much that would use all <NUM> megs on the palm vx , you wouldn not need to expand your memory anyway
and thirdly , expect to buy a real case for the palm immediatly after your initial purchase since all the palm comes with is a cardboard cover in leather that is attached to a stylus pen and that fits in one of the two pen slots on the palm
in general , i find that the palm vx surpasses it is more expensive competitors in every way ; from price to simplicity , from form to function
and if you need to get your life in order without dropping a boatload of money on a color screen and useless extras , then this is your best bet
and to put it simply , i wouldn not trade my palm for any &quot ; palm&quot ; top pda if you paid me
if you are still curious about the more complex pda is , go check out my review for the cassiopia
enjoy ! revuman : hey ! can ya let me outta the screen please ? peace !
i wish that i had purchased a handspring visor instead
i agree with all the positive comments that the other reviewer make regarding this unit
the unit is robust ( helpful if you drop it ) , convenient ( fits nicely into your pocket ) , has easy to use software and comes with enough memory that you can download a lot of mail to read offline
however , it is just too expensive when compared to other handheld units
you can get all these great features on a visor for half the price
in addition , the handspring comes with cheaper , more interesting plug in cards
the biggest advantage of the palm vx over the handspring is that is much &quot ; sexier&quot ;
smaller and more streamlined than the palm iii style visor
the palm vx is convenient , stylish and powerful
too bad it is overpriced .
i have had my palm vx since late 2001
i am still using it today , february 2008
i would love to now upgrade to a color palm
however , i am very fearful that i will not find another pda which offers the durability and longevity i have received from my current palm
i will continue to use my palm vx until it dies - permanently
there were times when i thought it had died , but discovered there was a button that was depressed and i didn not know it
that caused the battery to die and be unchargeable
once i figured out the problem , i depressed the button , recharged the unit , and went back to business as usual
i love my palm vx ! is there anything comparable ? if so , please email me at delecia1<MENTION>
works well for the most part , but if the battery dies all of it is information gets wiped
i bought this a loooong time ago and i know people probably just used phones now for this kind of thing , but if you are one of those who wants an organizer without having to pay for a damn phone and monthlies , just be aware of this problem and don not let it die
the nino with case , 20mb cf card and battery weighed 11oz
the palm vx was only 6oz with battery and slim palm case
the palm was also about half as thick and an inch shorter with the same screen size although an inch in taken up with the writing area
i first bought the nino because as a longtime pc user , i thought that wince would be more versatile
i thought microsoft would win the battle of the platform , thoughts of apple thorough my mind
i didn not want to find that i ran out of memory before it could do everything that i needed it to do
i found the nino a palmtop computer trying to be an organizer and the palm an organizer trying to be a palmtop computer
the nino could do everything and was very expandable
it is a computer , but it was just too darn big to carry around in my pocket
i don not carry a briefcase or travel for business
i wanted an everyday organizer to hold contacts , itineraries , notes , lists , appointments , financial information , simple maps and do some calculations
the palm vx does all this in such a small size
if i needed to use a computer on the road , i'd buy a laptop
i don not need to edit word documents , do any database work , access the internet , use multimedia or color , read books or play elaborate games on it
i just wanted something to hold basic information and do relatively simple calculations till i could transfer it back to my computer
so far it does everything that my nino did , but with less memory
i still have <PERCENT> memory left
about 2
1 mb out of <NUM> for the palm vs
<NUM> mb out of <NUM> for the nino ( with cf card ) ; the programs use less memory
it my case , size mattered
i found i was never carrying the nino when i needed it
i'd leave it in my car
overall , the palm does everything i need and want it to do
i do worry about expandability , but so far it hasn not been an issue
if i had gone with the palm v i'd be in trouble
if you want something that could do those other things , i'd just spend the money for a laptop
the nino could do those other things , but not very well , compared to a laptop
if they could cut back on the size of wince or pocketpc devices i think i'd consider them
till then , i am sticking with palm .
due to bumbling on the part of palm , the palm vx is still the standard in small , easy to use , pdas
sporting a screen ( compared to the puny screens on the m100 , m105 and m125 ) and a lithium rechargeable battery , the palm vx remains the sleekest , lightest pda on the market
it fits easily into your hand or your shirt pocket
now that its price appears to be coming down , it is a great buy , especially compared to the overpriced m125
palm is newest models , the m500 and m505 , are a bit better than the vx , mainly because of a new card slot and a slightly more tactile feel
the m505 also offers some rather anemic color
but palm is software hasn not really improved much since the palm vx came out , imho , and the expansion slot is not so compelling to me that it would be worth paying the additional dough
also , as an aside , make sure that you download three free for palm os : avantgo , a service that downloads articles from the new york times , sports illustrated , cnn and others every time you sync your palm ; vindigo , a city guide with restaurant and movie reviews ; and mapopolis , which has street maps that are keyword searchable
enjoy !
intro : you can read all the reviews ( there are a lot ) to help in making up your mind on the palm vx
for this short review , i am going to just focus the pros and cons
pros : - very slim ( normal wallet size , so you don not need a pda 'case' ) - very long battery life ( 1 week ) - mature product platform ( reliable , cheap apps , etc
) - clear monochromatic display in most daylight conditions- tons of applications- 8mb is plenty of memory for calendar , notes , todo , documents to go ( word , excel ) , and a couple of subscriptions from avantgo- easy to find replacement parts- inexpensive to buy and maintain- tons of accessories- bulletproof metal casingcons : - screen- only 8mb of memory ( not expandable ) - new applications have longer load time- serial connection ( usb adapters are available ) - external adapters required for bluetooth and wireless connectivityconclusion : that is my <NUM> cents
i just purchased another one for $50 after abusing the heck out of my ibm c3 ( it is the same unit as the vx ) for <NUM> years
i could have bargained him down , but 'mint' for $50 is worth every penny
for those interested , i think i paid $350 for the c3 back in 2000
yes , this model is obsolete , but i will keep it until there is an inexpensive , small , wallet sized pda with wireless and a comparable battery life
i hope you found this helpful .
i have been a dayrunner junkie for years
the problem is i stopped carrying it everywhere ( especially afterhours ) because it just got so big
i got the palm vx a few months ago and it has completely replaced my dayrunner
it totally syncs with my outlook so i have the one schedule at the office and on the palm
i have more than <NUM> contacts with phone , email , addresses and notes
i have the last <NUM> days worth of email messages
i have the latest fodor is guide for my home city and the ability to download any city i am visiting
i have the a daily listing of the current movies , which theaters are showing , and the times
i have hearts ( a favorite card game - with jack of diamonds is worth -10 )
i can take short notes and make reminders
it beeps to let me know when the next appointment is going to happen ( let is see a dayrunner do that ! )
and i have barely scratched the surface of what this thing can do
if you are considering getting a pda -- i cannot recommend this device enough
oh , and it is so small that i take it everywhere .
i have used a family members vx extensively and compared it to my clie , and cannot find anything redeemable about this model
moreover , the stylus slot is very easy to slip out with little to any contact , and this was not caused by overuse
i understand it is a few years old ( at least since the original v ) , and it is very thin , but other then that , there is not much to this
the backlight is very straining on the eyes , and makes the cool indiglo color of the clie look heavenly
the screen is not very sharp , but it is slightly larger then the which is a plus
no expansion slots , and (
) it is hard to recommend such a product thats 8mb will be used and you will be left wanting something with an expansion slot , like an m500 series or any clie model
this appears to be a last ditch attempt to make money off of an inferior product
and i am glad the family member that has this was issued it at work and does not own it
get a cheaper with more features , or higher end sony model , or a palm m500 instead .
you can read all you want about the specs on this thing
instead , i am going to go at this review by giving you a flavor for how i use mine
i have had my vx for about a year and a half now
i am very computer literate , with a professional job in which i travel often , have numerous appointments and am on the phone regularly
but until last year , i was married to my appointment book and rolodex
in fact , i carried my rolodex ( yes , the entire thing ) with me on trips
i finally gave up that circus act and bought a pda
all i can say is that i feel empowered now
i have all my key information at my fingertips and the ability to add and delete , on a moment is notice , information like a new phone number or a change in the time of an appointment
i went with the vx because of its sleek design
it slips easily in and out of my pants pocket or suit jacket inner pocket
the stylus is a bit dainty , but you have to deal with it to get the benefit of a thin device
graffiti is easy and fast enough once you practice a little - the menus are easily accessible if you need help figuring out how to make a particular punctuation mark or some symbol
i find the hardcover is enough protection for the screen - no need to protect the entire device in another case
the screen is defintely vulnerable to scratches , so be careful to only use the stylus when writing or buy some of those disposable plastic sheets that overlay on the screen
it syncs very easily ( in the cradle ) and the battery will last for a couple weeks ( probably <NUM> hours of usage ) if you don not recharge it at all
i'd recommend synching at least every week so that your information is safely stored on your pc in case you lose the palm ( a nice benefit of pdas that obviously didn not come with my appointment book/rolodex setup - : )
note that you will have to buy a cradle with a serial port ( included with purchase ) - i couldn not find one with a usb - so make sure you have a serial port on your laptop if that is what you will be synching to , or you will have to buy an adapter that would sit between the vx and your laptop
what do i do with this thing ? just to give you a flavor , here are some things i can do now that make my life a lot easier
since the palm allows you to schedule a certain event on a recurring basis , i put an entry on my calendar for 7 : 30 p
on the 3rd of every month to change my furnace filters
and i set the alarm on the palm just as a reminder
i also keep numerous memos , including one to write down any movies i'd like to rent when someone mentions a good one and another with christmas ideas for my wife
finally , i record business expenses in it during trips , which makes filling out the reimbursement forms easier
finally , make sure you enhance your palm experience by checking out three sites : avantgo
com , vindigo , and various shareware sites
avantgo offers information downloads from hundreds of sites covering general , business , technology , entertainment news , as well as recipes , jokes , airline schedules , etc
i download main stories from cnn , reuters , cnet is technology , and ncaa college basketball via the sporting news
vindigo offers geographically based information - a way to locate restaurants , movie theaters , etc
just by telling your palm where you are
much of the shareware out there is of marginal value , but i did download a neat little program that turns my palm into a mirror ( by blacking out the entire screen )
in sum , i think the vx is a great entry level device , especially at current prices
in the long run , i worry about microsoft is pocketpc operating system becoming more versatile ( it probably already is )
but for someone moving from paper to digital , the palm vx is a , proven success .
pros : a
lightwight & small enough to be easily carried in a pocket
just handle it gently - it is a delicate device ! b
lots of free or very cheap applications
i got a lot of my favourite games ( pacman , space invaders , tetris , chess , etc ) for free , and an excellent spread sheet software for $20
infrared communication is great
i can exchange applications and data with other palms , and even exchange info between my nokia <NUM> and the palm is phone book ( alas one at a time - a limitation imposed by the nokia 3360 , not the palm )
the 8mb of memory are plenty
i have an exchange compatible spread sheet application , games , a year is worth of appointments in the calender , dozens of book phone entries , a few spread sheets , etc , and use only 1
cons : a
the major downside of the palm vx is that it is delicate
though i kept the palm vx in the special leather wallent , the screen broke twice in eight months
as the warranty doesnt cover the screen breaking , i had to pay for the two fixes nearly as much as i paid to buy the palm in the first place
syncing the palm to two different computers is problematic
this is especially troublesome to people who would like to keep the palm , home computer , and office computer in sync
the cradle set is somewhat cumbersome
the cradle is used for both charging the palm and to sync it with the computer
this means that when travelling abroad i have to either carry the whole cradle set ( cradle , cables , and transformator which works with both 220v in israel and 110v in the u
) or buy a travel kit
many of the accessories for the palm are expensive
a set of three styli costs $15 , which is high for three pieces of plastic that are mass produced without human touch
a charging kit ( just a transformator and a cable ) is much more expensive than a charging kit for a cellular phone .
i have had the vx now for about a month
it is the ultimate geek toy
well designed for use
two negatives : 1
i have already had it freeze up once and force me to hard reset it
so , get in the habit of hotsyncing everyday
shame on palm for selling an appliance , meant to be carried around in your pocket or purse , and not providing a good protective case for it
plan on spending another $30 to $40 to buy a case .
very reasonable & reliable product
does what it claims to do
easy to use , switches very easily
note that it converts composite video to svideo & vice versa
so you only need to make one video input connection ( svideo or composite video )
highly recommend to anyone looking for simple manual audio/video switch .
i bought the recoton svs1000 after getting a second vcr , and a dvd player , for my tv
this despite the fact that my tv had three video inputs to begin with
these days a couple of inputs isn not enough
especially when you count video game systems , and camcorders
getting this saved me from having to swap cables all the time , which is what i was duing until i got it
it is simple to use , just plug and click
it is a great time saver .
i am sure this is a great device , but i couldn not use it on my tv
i have an older tv with only one hookup on the back
this device requires two hookups on the back of your tv
so , i had to return it
however , i did purchase another device from this same seller
i called their tech number and they told me exactly what i needed , gave me the item number to enter online and the cables i would need and the item numbers for them
they have a great tech team there and they were very helpful
i returned this item , but ordered another one from them that does work
great site to work with
i will purchase from them again when i need any electronic device
thanks tech support from parts express for helping me with my problem
"you are the greatest ! "
most modern television sets come with only two audio/video ( front and back ) , and one connectors
so what do you do when your dvd player , satellite receiver , playstation , tivo , etc want those for themselves ? you can either move your television and plug/unplug whatever you are going to use at the time ( which can drive you nuts , not to mention wear out your connectors ) , or just invest in one of these little things
i love how simple the recoton is
you just plug your stuff into the back of it ( up to <NUM> different devices ) , then run another set of cables from the &quot ; out&quot ; jacks to the back of your tv
that is it ! i have seen other little boxes that do the same thing for hundreds of dollars , and need electricity to work
a total waste of money , in my opinion
i keep my recoton on top of my television set , and switch between each device with a push of a button now
no more having to deal with wires everywhere or moving the tv
the recoton doesn not come with extra cables to run from the back of it to your tv set , so if you don not have some spare a/v and cables around , be sure to get a set
i personally use the brand from monster cable , which has wonderful picture quality .
i was getting frustrated because my &quot ; old&quot ; receiver/amp ran out of places to plug things in - i was having to choose which items to leave out and it was frustrating me that i couldn not enjoy my system w/ all my devices
for just $20 this little device came to my rescue ! there is a much more expensive version in the crutchfield catalog ( like $150 )
sure that one has a few extra bells and whistles but i don not think it justifies teh $130 extra ( like a remote that only has <NUM> buttons
? ) this sucker is all you need if you own a dvd , vcr , game station , etc .
of course it doesn not create out of composite , stupid ! i am amazed at people who don not get it sometimes
this device is areal dandy for hooking things up to your home entertainment system , and for connecting things to the computer it can not be beat
i have atuner to play my mp3 is through , with bookshelf speakers , analogcamcorder , vcr , remote feed cameras from a company called , allsorts of stuff
is only used for other connections
you can buy a gizmo which will convert av into , right here atamazon , but it costs about a hundred bucks and isn not worth it becausethe quality doesn not improve
it just eliminates a connector on onepart of the system
instead of plugging and unplugging things fromthe back of my computer i just have this one switchbox and reach upand punch a button down
i have one on my computer and one on my homeentertainment system , and it works on either system quite well
whatis cool about reaching around into the back of your system wheneveryou want to change something because of a lack of connections ? forthe computer sound system it gives you the flexibility of inputting tothe , and if you have an video card or two , likei do , you can hook up arrangements for sound video input , as well ashaving a firewire
for [the money] this thing is a great piece ofequipment , and if i didn not think so i wouldn not have `em , them in my house already .
i use it for my tivo , dvd player and playstation and it works great
if you don not mind pushing a button , then it is much easier on the wallet then the $80+ automatic models available
the only thing to be aware of is that it does not come with an extra /rca cable to go from the box to the tv , so if you don not have one , be sure to pick one up at the same time .
what can you really say about a cd case ? well , for one thing , the price for these things have really come down over the years
i remember when a large capacity case such as this one used to cost up to <NUM> bucks ( ! ) , which , in my opinion , was way overpriced
i am glad to see that the price has dropped to a reasonable level
i like this case
it is easy to retrieve and insert cds from and back into the pages
the outside material feels better than the old- school faux leather
so , if you are in the market for a case to store all your freshly ripped music and flicks , this is a good choice for the frugal shoppers .
i reading the reviews on here i was skeptic at best about buying one of these cd cases
but being that i have well over 1 , 000 cd is approaching 2 , 000 i need something big for storage so decided this was the best bang for the buck
this case is well constructed and doesn not tear although some reviewers would have you think it tears just by looking at it
if you feel the need to carry over <NUM> cd is with you wherever you are going you are an idiot in the first place , this case is perfectly suited for what i need storage
these cases have a cleaning wipe in the front that is attached to the case which is something you won not find in a case logic case that people seem so orgasmic about , which by the way i have two of and they aren not as good as this
anyway , i bought <NUM> of these now and when i fill the last one up i will buy another and another these are the best value you will find anywhere .
yes , i am writing the review years after i bought the product
but hey
it is an excellent one that i used for several years
if you are not a netflix type of person and still have cd/dvd at home
this wallet is the way to go .
nothing special
just holds a lot
doesn not seem very substantial , so i wouldn not carry it around much , but it is fine for storage , which was all i needed
this is a very easy and neat way to store your cd is
if there is any problem at all , it is that it holds so many that it is quite heavy when full .
sure its a cd folder but they could have least of put the pages on rings ( instead of stitching the pages in ) so at least that way the pages would not be lower than the outer zippers when it is opened up
you shouldnt have to worry about scratching your cds up on the zipper when you try to slide them back in
get a case logic cd folder instead they use ring binders for better organization of the pages
this product is slightly less than average , even though it is only a cd folder they could have made it better for the cost .
as a victim of shoddy cd wallets for years -- rings that become warped seemingly on their own , plastic tabs that scratch the backs of cds , etc
-- the fellowes case is a welcome respite from the $40+ lower quality units from cdprojects
fellowes' construction is tighter , cd pages better designed , zipper a lot more sturdy
the polish cloth is likewise clever ( albeit somewhat useless being physically attached to the case )
perhaps i stand alone , but in my humble opinion ringed enclosures are a nuisance in larger capacity cd wallets
simply put , these wallets can not handle the bulk weight of the cd is , not to mention the girth of the pages squashed into them
this fellowes case ( plus a similar caselogic offering i purchased last year ) can handle what its designed to
and well
in sum , this case is a steal at this price
supersaver shipping makes you feel almost as if amazon is paying you for it
: )
i bought two of these , and they work well for the price paid
i would have added a label holder and a capability to add a few more pages
the disk slots are not the newer deluxe versions , but are adequate .
i have both this one and the caselogic version
they both work fine , though i prefer the smooth outer covering of the caselogic to the rougher , more feel of this one
just a personal preference , though
these books work really well for cutting down on the amount of space that cds and dvds take up
the little cd booklets fit in the slots too , so you can put those in there beside the disks to make them easier to find
they make these in different sizes , but this is a pretty good compromise in terms of size and weight
the larger folders will save more space vs
multiple smaller ones , but the cds and dvds really get heavy in the higher numbers
koskin dvd binder <NUM> capacity .
this organizer is probably one of the better constructed ones on the market
true , it is not the best looking and at times even feels poorly built , but it holds up pretty well
i prefer this organizer because of its binding
organizers with riveted , style binding , etc
tend to give way very quickly
fellowes bindings have multiple points of contact and are very durable
another important thing for me is access to my media
i hate badly designed organizers , whose zippers sratch my media while trying to remove or put media back
this organizer has been designed to permit the least amount of interference
for those who need more assurance , fellowes makes all ( gorgeous ! ) cd organizers for body glove
one star for the blandness in looks and the &quot ; looking&quot ; zipper
i prefer the body glove zippers .
this is a nice case for the money with loads of capacity .
this is a pretty good deal for a <NUM> cd wallet
i was considering the case logic wallet but it is about [price]more than the fellowes
the construction of the fellowes is good and similar to my other case logic wallets , the carrying handle is especially usueful as it can get pretty heavy when full
my only gripe is the design of the plastic covering for each cd slot
it is basically an oval shaped hole in the plastic placed near the hole of the cd , while you can grasp the cd hole and top of the edge of the cd to start to remove the cd , you will reach the end of oval so you will have to pinch the top of the cd to remove it from the wallet
for this case you can not grab the hole of the cd and the edge and remove the cd in one motion
nevertheless this can easily be fixed by cutting the plastic to open up the hole
doing it that <NUM> times was major pain but worth it as it is alot easier to remove cds now .
these albums ( which are made in china ) are given away for free in china when you buy <NUM> copy dvd is
the dvd is cost about a dollar each , so for a $10 purchase you get one of these for free
must be quite a markup to get to $25 .
we had the cd books inserted behind the cd , which makes it very bulky , but contain more
better to use 1/2 the capacity , and place them one next to the other , if you can afford the space
the book is large and well made
personaly i would prefer such a thick book to be harder cover , with 'o' ring binder , which it isn not
the pages are binded to the cover so you cannot move pages around , but rather have to move the disks
it is harder to alphabetize and add cd is this way
bottom line , a good , well built basic product .
at first i couldn not wait to get this
i ordered <NUM> at the same time
as i started to fill the pages , i started seeing the first of several problems
pockets were tight and it would be very easy to scratch a dvd on the zipper
speaking of zipper , it is very hard to work when the wallet is full
the other day , i wanted to see about getting more cd wallets ( not necessarily fellows ) when i read the reviews here for this wallet
i read the part about not putting cd is in the inner pockets because they would bend
i went home and checked mine
sure enough , when the wallet is full , the cd is are slightly bent
i would imagine if they were left that way for a period of time , they would probably stay curved .
i bought this in 2004 , when i decided to get rid of my cd jewel cases and move them all into something that takes up less room
<NUM> years later , and it still works
i keep a cd on one side of the page , and the liner notes/cover/etc on the other
holds up perfectly for those looking for cd storage .
i use this to store cds and dvds at my office and it has worked fine for me with no complaints for over <NUM> years now
does what it is supposed to do .
the 'case logic' wallet holds 'only' <NUM> cds , compared with 320 , but that is a -lot- of cds
the design , stronger construction , ( the handle especially ) , and greater ease of access make it the first choice
i cut down the booklets , etc , and was able to fit the the full <NUM> with all the extras , still with good access
to have all of my boxes metamorphized into one sleek package ( not much larger that my binoculars' case ) , makes me happy every time i look over at it .
this is obviously not for anyone &quot ; on the go&quot ;
i don not go anywhere i need over <NUM> disks
i have purchase several of these to catalog and store my collection of music cd is
i have also needed space for the new cd is i am downloading and burning
this is a great deal on a huge storage solution .
i have purchased a lot of cd cases and i must say this one is great
built solid .
bought this after i realized twelve years of computing equals a heck of a lot of optical disks
the sleeves are at least as soft on the disks as the newer case logic carriers i have , and definitely softer than the case logic carriers ! it seems durable enough , and with a carrier of this size the pages are probably better than a binder
this carrier is probably not the best for portable storage - the carrier really doesn not open well unless it is sitting on a flat surface
but for my purposes - sitting under my desk as an archive - it fits the bill just fine .
this cd/dvd case was well worth the price for one this size .
i am very happy with it ! all my cd/dvd fit nicely in the sleeves with the paper of the songs
i bought <NUM> more
doesnt scratch cd/dvds
i was looking for a way to hold all my cd and dvd in a more efficent way
i have used fellows brand before
i out grew my case logic cd/dvd holder a few months ago
for the price the fellows is a good product but the handle is kinda generic and the overall looks is blah
it can hold <NUM> cd is no problem and came with a cloth to wipe of the dust
i like the feel of my case logic holder but if i upgraded to <NUM> version i would had to have paid $ more
i am happy with my purchase .
i have had my <NUM> for about a year and like it very much
it is easy to use ( and i agree with most of the comments below ) and takes good quality pix
( most of mine are flowers/birds
) i use the nimh rechargeable batteries - have two sets - and have no problems ; they last much longer than the nicd ones
i use a microtek reader connected to my mac is usb port ( and with an earlier mac , used a card
) my only big complaint is the lag time between seeing and taking the shot - often a problem with birds
question : are any of the cards better/quicker than others ? i have a sandisk
i am also thinking about upgrading to the 995 , but wish it used aa batteries .
for the most part , i am quite happy with my coolpix <NUM> ( bought at amazon
com )
it certainly gets the job done , and the images are as good as what i have gotten with my 35mm slr , if not better
my main beefs are the ones that are well known about this camera : the flash and zoom are both very limited ( to the point where i pretty much consider this an outdoor camera - the one time that i did use it indoors extensively , i set the sensitivity to and shot by available light ) , and i wish it were possible to manipulate the and shutter speed directly
and i have got a new beef : due to the small size of the camera , it is nearly impossible to use it without getting thumb prints all over the lcd screen
but these notwithstanding , it is a great camera that takes good , well exposed crisp pictures , and that is the bottom line .
ok , so this camera will not be able to take photos that can be blown up to a poster size
however , i bought this camera fairly cheap ( just under dollahs ) earlier this year and it is fantastic ! it is sturdy , the glass is sharp and the photos look amazing
the color , the white balance and the contrast are just spot on
just look at photos taken by this camera by this camera on flickr , and you will see this thing takes some beautiful photos ! it is quick to focus , it is got great battery life and snaps photos really quick ! you won not regret buying this camera .
i got this from amazon
com <NUM> days ago and is still shooting away
sharp pictures , excellent focusing &amp ; light weight
here are some negative points if that is what you are looking for -1
it is a battery hogger
the <NUM> energizer ( alkaline ) battery pack that came with the camera lasted only for about <NUM> pictures
you need rechargeable nimh battery
. andthe charger is [even more money]
you don not really need the optional ac adapter
it is just another thing to load the electrical outlet near the pc
the 8mb compactflash card is just not enough if you want to stick to the 1600x1200 resolution which is the default
at normal compression , you can have only <NUM> pictures
i feel that 640x480 resolution should have been the default
640x480 is only available in advanced options
at 640x480 , the 8mb card can hold <NUM> pictures at normal compression which is good enough for me
but if you want to stick to 1600x1200 , you may be better off considering a card with more capacity
i decided not to reduce the number of stars because of these negative points because the quality easily makes up for them and these negative points may be unavoidable ( as in the case of battery usage ) or not applicable to all ( as in the case of resolution &amp ; storage size )
i had been using nikon n50 ( ) for years and had fallen love with that camera
i guess the n50 will have to excuse me now !
heard about the images this camera and the <NUM> gave , and they are great ! this is not a point and shoot camera , because you have to override some of the automatic settings when there is backlight or even frontlight
i would not recommend it for anyone who hasn not had a <NUM> mm that they had to tweak the picture
the best thing about this complaint is that you can view the picture immediate and reshoot it again
one reason i got the <NUM> instead of <NUM> is that it takes <NUM> aa batteries and the <NUM> aa rechargeables are less costly .
skip this digital camera and go directly to the coolpix <NUM> by nikon ( also on amazon )
why , you ask ? well , this coolpix is quite old ( in terms of digital ) and you will be throwing your good money after a badly outdated camera
here are the details why : megapixels
the coolpix <NUM> takes 2
1 megapixel pictures , but the <NUM> take 3
1 megapixel
( more pixels are preferred to less since this will affect your image quality
and believe me - you will see the difference ! ) zoom
the <NUM> has a 2x optical , plus 2
5 digital zoom lens ; however , the <NUM> has a 2
5x optical and the digital zoom
you always want as high an optical zoom because using pure digital zoom will make your pictures look fuzzy ! memory
both the <NUM> and <NUM> come with <NUM> mb of compactflash , but most people would agree that this isn not enough
purchase an additional compactflash card for <NUM> mb or more and you will be happy you did
the <NUM> only connects via serial port , but the <NUM> connects via serial or usb
the usb connection is much much faster for downloading pics to yoru computer , but the serial ( 800 is only method ) is horrendously slow
the <NUM> uses <NUM> aa batteries , but the <NUM> uses far superior and much 2cr5 lithium batteries
the 880 is batteries also weigh less
this is the only reason you shoudl consider the <NUM> ( $499 ) over the <NUM> ( $699 )
but let is face it , if you have $499 for the 800 , you should fork over the extra $200 and get the <NUM> so you can have a digital camera that will last you more than a year
the <NUM> is being phased out by nikon
run to the <NUM> today ! : )
the camera has no usb connector--it uses a serial wire , which means it can connect to most pcs or older macs , but needs an adapter or a flash card for newer macs
apart from that it takes good pictures and at the price it is selling for now it is a good entry into digital photography
the optional lenses are great and will transfer to other nikon models later if you upgrade
i prefer the form factor of the 900/950/990 even though they are bigger , because of the way the body twists
this makes it so you can see the lcd when you are holding the camera over your head pointing down , or down by your knees pointing up
great for pics of kids , crowds , etc
the nikon <NUM> series are the only still cameras i know of that do this .
i must admit that i like having new electronic toys when they come out
i purchased a digital camera in <NUM> and was not entirely impressed by what 500$ got me then
however , <NUM> years later , i stumbled upon the nikon coolpix <NUM> at a great price and took another shot at digital imaging
pictures : the pictures it takes are fantastic ! the 1600x1200 resolution really makes a difference when making prints
they look like they were taken with a 35mm
this is not even mentioning the backing of a quality nikkor lens that picks up lots of detail other digicams of the same resolution do not
another feature that impressed me was the fact i could add additional lenses to it ( and nikon has <NUM> designed specifically for the coolpix 800/950/990 )
features : it has a lot of features of its bigger brother like an uncompressed tiff format , ability to take b&amp ; w pictures , and adjustable metering
however , for a photographer , i liked the fact the auto mode was easy to use and allowed me to take great pictures right away
i now can switch to manual mode to take more control of the picture , but the camera is ready to take great pictures right out of the box
unlike other reviewers , mine came with a paper manual in addition to a that explained many of the basic features and taught me about some of the more exotic ones
this is a great camera for anyone wanting a digital camera that takes great pictures but doesn not want to spend ton of money on features that may not even be used
otherwise , the cp990 and the d1 are really nice cameras for those interested in more control
i do recommend getting an extra flash card since <NUM> mb does run out fairly quickly when taking pictures in fine or normal mode
getting a usb sandisk compactflash reader was also a big help since the connection is serial and can take a long time to download pictures if you have a lot of them .
this is the first serious digital camera i got , and i have been pretty hapy with it
great macro , decent zoom , and fair response time
the other complaints you hear , including how it chews batteries and the like , are generally true
still , given a pocket full of batteries , i'd take this with me when i go places
my biggest complaint is the size , it doesn not travel super well ( i like to keep my hands free , i am forgetful and often misplace things )
i like to stick my camera in my pocket , and it just doesn not fit
still , its plusses make it a decent camera
i'd check out some of the newer coolpix cameras if you were buying new and had the budget for it , they are a great line .
this camera takes wonderful pictures but the zoom doesn not do the job
its no good for taking pictures of your child playing football but its great for pictures on a trip
be careful the lag between pushing the shutter and taking the picture is long as well as the time between pics at high quality .
i agree with most of the positive reviews of this camera
this camera gave me good results on a recent trip to europe
* the battery life is just fine if you are good about turning off the camera
i took over <NUM> photos before i needed to change the batteries , and was not too stingy with the review mode
that is not great but certainly not as bad as i was led to beleive
* the little screen does get smudged with your nose a lot , unless you are super careful
get used to it
* the software isn not that great , but there are a lot of shareware or freeware programs out there to look manipulate pictures with
* the camera is not very good for action shots , but that was not a major issue with me
* the camera is a little bit big , compared to say the canon elph , but not really too big or heavy
this camera is very good value for the money , i might even rate it higher depending on the relative price of a few other cameras
overall i was extremely pleased with the quality of the pictures from my dc 280 , and my wife was quite impressed with the picture quality as well
i only wish it had a little more optical zoom ability , a burst mode , and more memory .
the kodak dc280 is exactly what a serious soho user or amateur photographer should be looking at as their diigital camera
i researched and waited for ages for the right combination of features and price to come available
when i saw the dc280 for $447
00 ( compared to the near-$700 it was a few months ago ) , i knew the time was right and pulled the trigger
everything i need in a personal/professional camera is basically here
the photo quality at top resolution is beyond anything you'd expect
when people see a photo from the dc280 printed on the hp970c , they are taken aback at how good it really looks
one of the greatest sources of differentiation in the quality of film camera output lies in the quality of the paper that was used
i have hundreds of family photographs from the 1940 is to 1999 , which vary widely in how clear they look
but no matter how good the best studio photographer is shot looks , it cannot surpass the clarity of the dc280 is best pictures
the dc280 is not a perfect camera
there are saturation problems , as well its greedy use of batteries
the 8mb flashcard that comes included has to be one of the reasons the camera is so inexpensive , along with there not being any ac adapter included
the kodak software works perfectly in windows 2000 , but is flakey in windows <NUM> se
however , one hidden bonanza came to light when i used thumbsplus 4
1 to acquire the images off the camera ; you can save them as lossless tiff files instead of the default jpeg files that the camera uses
this camera will help my business and will help me be as creative as i want to be
it was worth every penny i spent
you should give it a try as well .
i am a photographic and computer enthusiast and having these two elements come together is a delight for me
so , i have all the very expensive stuff , including kodak is $20m commercial digital cameras
so , i know what quality is and how much it costs
as starters , the dc280 makes great color shots with very suprising
the advertisments say &quot ; good&quot ; for 8x10 photos , however , as a very picky guy , when you get past 5x7 print sizes , the pictures start to turn fuzzy
but the 5x7 prints are shockingly clear with brilliant colors
but , so what , how many prints does one make larger than 5x7 anyway
this camera is easy to use &amp ; small , and i carry it on vacation locations , when i don not want to carry my larger and heavier commercial camera
i was truly shocked at the excellent picture quality of the 280
also , kodak includes great software , so after a picture taking day/nite , one can easily connect to the yellow video plug on your tv ( or hotel tv ) for a slide show of the days activities
i would recommend purchasing a 64mb memory card with the camera purchase , so you will get plenty of picture opportunities ( 75+ shots ) without having to worry about using up memory
in other words , since you can erase shots you don not like , take many , many shots and pick the best ones you like for printing or
i bring my laptop with me on trips , so in the evening , i can copy the to the hard disk , and erase the camera memory card , in preparation for the next days photo activities
kodak provides serial , usb cables , and software to accomplish this simply
definitely do not buy a digital camera with less than 2 , 000 , 000 pixels
( the older models , presently having good sale prices , are technology of 2/3 years ago , and you will wish you spent the extra money for this camera )
since kodak has been the color business for <NUM> years , ( well
50+years ) its no surprise that they have created an electronic imager ( the ccd chip ) with the best color quality and detail
this is a must have , you will not be dissappointed
if you have another few hundred dollars , check out the sony or olympus printers , which produce actual photo quality continuous tone prints up to 4x5 sizes ; these printers are not is with all the little dots
the camera and the printer makes for a great combo family gift for under $2m , that anyone in the family can use without having to even turn on a computer , as the printer prints directly off the camera memory card
so that you don not make yourself craze , and since its slightly different than a typical film point and shoot camera , be sure to read the instruciton booklet , before pushing all the buttons
the documentation kodak gives you is very easy to understand , so take it slow when you open the box for the first time
it is so intuitive to use , after the first <NUM> outings , you not need to keep going back to the booklets
jlw/991203 .
i am a beginner to digital photography and this camera has me hooked
it is easy to learn , easy to use , and produces beautiful pictures
congrats to kodak for including the charger with batteries , and the regular batteries so i was able to take pictures as soon as the camera arrived
congrats also to amazon for having the best price i could find on the web
the software works well but i wish kodak had included the home version of adobe instead of the business version
this camera is a definite winner and i highly recommend it to both the beginner and experienced photographer .
resolution quality is fantastic for the amazon
com price
it comes with battery charger which is a must
i print great 8x10 pictures
if you want to take many high resolution picture , order an extra memory card .
we bought this camera several years ago and have taken it with us on two trips abroad and many trips around the usa
i am not a camera maven but i have just had a terrific experience with this camera
our pictures come out clear and sharp
it is easy to use
the color is great
the camera feels good in my hands
mine came with a <NUM> mb card and i bought one extra 32mb card
i can travel for weeks at a time without ever worrying about &quot ; film
&quot ; i have even dropped the camera by accident a few times without breaking it
the flash works nicely in a variety of light
if i had to find one thing to criticize i would pick the zoom lens but i have yet to see a competitive product with a better one
in short , i have taken thousands of pictures with the camera without a hitch
in fact , i usually have a big smile on my face when i see the results
and my friends and family do too .
i have used three cameras lately : 1 ) sony 2 ) olympus 3 ) kodak dc280 all three have 2
1 megapixel and good lenses
the sony is the only one with no zoom , but has the best picture quality and the best lowlight exposure
there is also the dscf505 which has the huge 3xzoom lens , but it is too big to be nice
the sony is also the smallest and the easiest to use
the operating system is similar to the dv camcorders
the second best is the olympus due to its zoom lens , the viewfinder and just weaker in low light conditions
the <NUM> pictures will fit onto a 64mb smartmedia in hq , a little more than with sony
the kodak i liked the least , mostly because of its klunky operating system and the poor colors ( in comparison )
i currently use the olympus for professional work and the sony due to its breast pocket size to snap great photos anywhere and anytime .
i have used <NUM> or so digital cameras before , but this is the first one that i bought
before i go on , let me warn you that this model has been replaced by the kodak 3400
however , i see no significant improvement and they include less in the box with the <NUM> ( no rechargeable battreries )
let me talk about the camera
it is very simple to use , yet includes the essential features for all but the most serious photographers
the annoying feature that makes me give this a <NUM> star rating is the location of the lcd screen - i found that if i use my right eye ( which is my dominant eye ) in the viewfinder that my nose touches the lcd screen and smudges it
come on kodak , that was a goof
this does not effect the quality of piuctures , its just annoying until you realize that it is a hopeless battle to keep the lcd clean
other than that , it is terrific
i immediately purchased a sandisk <NUM> meg compactflash card , and have since ordered a <NUM> mb card
battery life is long ( i do use the power save mode , which is not on by default )
a few tips
once you experience digital photography you will discover that , just like videos , things work best without flash unless you absolutely need it
also , this does have a limited telephoto power with just a 2x optical lens - not a problem for me , but you need to know what you want ( if you want much more than 2x , i think you should look at an slr model )
buy this one , its a great value .
have you ever taken kodachrome slides - the color saturation is upped a little , as is the contrast ; everything is a little realer than real
and why not
kodak has had most of a century learning how to reproduce color , and they have applied it to their digital cameras
you will not believe what you see on the screen of your computer monitor - can a digital camera really be this good ? it looks like a kodachrome slide - heck , it looks better ! printing is another thing
the reason pro photographers and serious ameteurs have preferred slides is because the range of contrast is much greater than prints - prints can only reflect light , not generate it , as can a slide projector or computer monitor
so a great deal is lost in going to prints in terms of light ; and as even your basic printer can print at <NUM> dpi , the lower resolution of the digital camera makes its effects felt
however , i find 8x10 prints at the highest resolution of the dc280 quite acceptable ( using a hp832c )
but the camera cannot make uncompressed files - all files are jpeg compressed to some extent , and the artifacts may show
this is a point and shoot camera ; no control of focus , shutter speed , or aperture is possible
the camera is a little heavy , and you wish for hooks for a neck strap
you wish for more buttons on the body of the camera , rather than having to go through levels of menus
the lens front is very vulnerable ( and the lens cap is not automatic ) - it would be wise if the lens were protected by a protruding metal or plastic guard , as some of kodak is competitors do
i find the battery life using kodak is supplied metal hydride batteries quite acceptable , particularly if you buy a second set ; but the supplied alkalines lasted only through the evening i bought the camera
i am a wide angle person rather than a telephoto person , but in an ideal world , a 3x rather than a 2x would be welcome - 60mm ( equiv
) is hardly telephoto
this is basically a wide angle to normal lens
i have been a darkroom photographer since 1952 , and a sometime professional since <NUM> - i am delighted to see the end of chemical photography , with its dangerous chemicals and the near impossibility for amateurs of getting good results in color
now all you need is a digital camera and an printer
prices are falling - give it a try !
i have had this camera for about <NUM> weeks now and all though i am somewhat satisfied , i think that the picture quality could be better for this price and resolution
i also purchased an olympus d340r for a friend , and although it is only 1
3 megapixels , the color is much better , the pictures blow up almost as well , despite the lower res
, and the lcd display is sharper and easier to view in daylight
considering the huge difference in price , the olympus is a bargain
of course it does not zoom , but you can hardly call the 60mm of the kodak a real zoom
having used zoom lenses on 35mm slrs for years i can testify that the <NUM> to <NUM> zoom is more like medium wide angle to normal view , rather than true zoom
you will have to buy an accessory 2x lens and adapter to get true + zoom
if you want a less expensive , good performing , zoom camera , check out the olympus d450 zoom .
price : getting better - i paid close to $700 oct `99quality : great ! the pictures are unbelievable
and i mean that
if i print a 4"x6" on my hp 952c it is hard to tell the difference from a 35mm camera
function : the camera could use a better design but it is still much better than some other ones i have tried
the review screen is perfectly placed where your nose hits it when you are taking a picture so i am constantly cleaning it off
in high quality mode mine holds about <NUM> pictures ( 20meg card )
this is plenty for most events/photo ops
after i take pictures i go back and review them and delete the ones that i don not like
this way , when you have <NUM> pictures in your card they are <NUM> pictures that you like
much better that taking a whole roll of 35mm pictures and only liking <NUM> of them once they are developed
overall i love the camera ( and so do all my friends that try it ) .
the dc280 is a nice little camera , but the results i get from it aren not any better than those from oy old dc210 that it replaced
in fact , i find the autofocus to be less accurate , or at least harder to use than with the 210
and , alas , it still eats batteries by the ton .
as this camera has been replaced by the 3400 , it has fallen in price , but not in performance
in fact , it performs as well as its replacement , and costs a good bit less
for a <NUM> meg camera , it offers a great deal
it is well built , has great optics , a 2x true zoom , decent battery use , usb support and enough user controls to make it an acceptable camera for a photographer
the resolution is more than adequate for internet apps and good enough for printing clear <NUM> x 10s
it is also very sturdy
i think that while supplies last , it is the best <NUM> meg around and would be an awesome christmas present for almost anyone .
i have owned <NUM> or <NUM> of these cameras , my first one was quite by accident , received it in payment for driving for someone
the second one did not do to well , this one that i got from amazon works just like it is supposed to work , it took me through a <NUM> year high school reunion with shining colors ! it was interesting to photograph all around this boarding school , many things had changed , but many were similar or the same
i have many pictures now that i can look at to remind me of my 50th anniversary of my graduation
thanks , amazon , you did well ! richard l

after careful consideration , our family bought a kodak
this camera looks great- usb , zoom , lcd panel , many features-- but get to know it
while usb is nice , not all computers have it , and windows <NUM> is necessary
also the zoom is no where near as good as i would have liked-- definetly a 3x zoom is required
while the resolution is nice , remember that that is not all to a digital camera .
this is a very solid camera that takes good pictures indoor or outdoors
it is very user friendly and consistently takes good pictures , no matter who is taking them ( unlike several sony is i tried before settling on this one )
their are several features on this camera that make it particularly appealing to me
* accepts any type of aa battery and comes with rechargeable ones* transfers pictures through usb ( can also get a compact flash card reader , i highly reccommend )
* has a video patch cord that allows you to preview pictures on any tv or vcr with an rca input
* accepts flash memory of any brand up of <NUM> mb+ ( alot of pictures )
* border software allows you to import different borders for your shots , such as birthdays and weddings
although the camera is only a 2
0 megapixel , i have learned megapixels don not tell the whole story for the quality of a picture
they only become important if you want to consistently produce picture sizes above 5x7 ( 8x10 takes a dip in quality )
overall a very good camera for an enry level to average user
if you are a more advanced user with higher resolution needs , you might checkout the nikon coolpix <NUM> series , a very good camera , though it is twice the price of the kodak <NUM> zoom .
using the rechargable battery that came with the camara , i took more than <NUM> pictures , maybe <NUM> of them used flash
the battery still not dried up before i quit ! i own this baby for more than <NUM> month
yesterday i bought a <NUM> mb compactflash memory from amazon
now i realize it is too much for this camara
it can store <NUM> pictures with <NUM> x <NUM> resolution
boy ! the only drawback of this camara is the delay between shots
first <NUM> only delay <NUM> seconds , but after that , needs about <NUM> seconds to process
other than that , it is perfect .
since there are still a number of these available used through amazon markeplace , i thought i'd add a quick review myself
my parents bought one in about 2004 , and apparently used it very little
i inherited it in like new condition
i am a " amateur" photographer , own several cameras including a sony/minolta dslr
this camera , as others have noted , takes very good pictures and is well made and easy to operate
many times higher resolution just isn not needed , especially if you do a lot of web photography like i do
put an upgraded cf card in it ( a cf slot instead of sd/xd/whatever are another sign of quality ) and you are good for hundreds or even thousands of shots ! the only down side is that it *is* slow by today is standards
its highest iso is only <NUM> if i remember correctly ( maybe not even that high ) , and cf write times are a bit on the long side
the proprietary usb/serial connector is annoying in 2011 , the original cable for mine is long gone and you can not use a standard usb cable - which isn not a real big problem since i generally use a card reader anyway
i'd say this camera is much better built , and takes better pictures than most of the sub $100 "blister pack" cameras out there - as long as 2mp is enough resolution .
i really like this camera ! i am getting much better results ( more natural and vivid colors ) with my digital camera as compared to scanning 4x6 photographs--there is no need to worry about color adjustments ! i researched many cameras before deciding to buy
this one seemed to be the best quality for the price
the two main enhancements in this camera v
the dc280 are the support for uncompressed pictures and the ability to record audio annotations to accompany the pictures
these two features swayed me to the dc290
in all honesty , i find that i am not even using these features
the uncompressed format takes up way too much memory ( you would need to buy 128mb storage card to get around <NUM> uncompressed pictures at the highest resolution )
i have found that the best quality jpeg compression produces fine quality ( i can print 8x10s ) and i can fit <NUM> times more pictures on the memory card
the dc290 also has slightly better max resolution ( 1 , 792 x 1 , 200 v
1 , 760 x 1 , 168 )
the dc290 also supports a 2 , 240 x 1 , 500 resolution that is accomplished using interpolation , but this probably won not produce any different results then enlarging a 1 , 792 x 1 , 200 image using photoshop or some other software
i have found that battery life isn not a problem ( as some suggest ) if you use rechargeable batteries
they seem to have a much better life than alkaline batteries ( rechargeable or not )
i also limit my use of the display , which is not difficult since i tend to prefer using the viewfinder
this *significantly* reduces battery usage
the only draw back is that you can not use the digital zoom without the display
this is also not a problem for me because the optical zoom has been sufficient for my usage
also , digital zooming in general tends to produce poor quality pictures , although i can not personally attest to quality of kodak is digital zooming
the one problem i have with this camera is the delay between the time when the button is pressed and the time when the picture is taken
it is a least a second or two , which makes taking action photos very difficult--it is hit or miss with the timing
i tried to use the burst feature , but i found that to have limited usefulness
i was use to using the completely manual , tried and true , pentex slr
without being overburdened by a lot of electronics , there was very little latency
i suppose going to any automatic camera , digital or not , could produce the same frustration
, i love this camera
it takes great quality , high resolution pictures
however , i would also look at the dc280 as a less expensive alternative .
we use this camera at a manufacturing facility for all our documentation
a picture is worth a thousand words and this camera is worth the price
it is easy to use , comfortable , and easy to download to a pc
it is also very durable
many people use this camera and it has gone through some abuse in an industrial environment
the pictures have real nice color details and sharpness
the software that comes with it isn not the greatest
i recommend photosuite iii or ms home publishing to get the most out of your digital pictures
extra memory is also a must have
invest in a <NUM> or <NUM> mb memory card and you can take pictures all day .
this camera replaces my sony digital camera
there is no comparison
the dc290 takes true photographic qualitiy pictures
i tried the camera in a variety of difficult lighting situations
it took perfect pictures every time ! the software interface is great
it makes the camera look like another drive letter in your computer
when the camera is plugged into the computer ( usb port ) , the drive letter appears in windows explorer
you can then simply navigate and use the standard cut and paste tools to move the files
i am extremely impressed with the qualitiy of the pictures , ease of use , and clear instruction manuals
the camera does eat the batteries
it comes with a set of disposable ( so you can use the new camera while the others are charging ) and rechargeable with charger
i purchased a second set of rechargeable batteries
i simply charge one set while the other is in use .
the dc290 is great for photos in which you get to pose your subject , but for action shots it should be avoided
the amount of time that passes from when the shutter release is pushed , and the time that the camera actually takes the picture seems like an eternity
i am sure its only seconds , but i have missed out on a few moments because of that time lapse
would i suggest my friends buy this camera ? yes , and i have
but if you are buying it to cover sporting events , you should look for something with a shorter &quot ;
&quot ; ( my terminology for the shutter lag ) *update 7/21/01 i have owned this now for over a year
i have really come to love it
when i bought this camera it was a couple hundred dollars more than what it is now , but i decided it was going to get treated like any other camera that i have owned
which means i have done everything except try to pound nails into wood with it
i bought a 128mb cf card to go with it- a must in my opinion
i wanted to upgrade to the kodak dc4800 , but that was a mistake
the dc4800 is a mess compared to the dc290
( the only thing good about the dc4800 was the software upgrade
my computer used to take about <NUM> minutes to shutdown , now it takes seconds
if you buy the dc290 get the latest software and drivers from kodak ) if you already own the dc290 and are thinking about taking kodak up on there towards a dc4800 , don not do it
the dc4800 has so many dead pixels that color rendering is atrocious , it is also so cheaply put together that i would be scared to treat it the way i do my dc290
the dc290 may be oddly shaped and heavy , but its a sturdy workhorse .
i bought this camera just over a year ago for $369
the camera worked great , then mysteriously started displaying an e11 code when i tried to turn it on
when i looked into the owner is manual , i found that e11 indicates corrupt firmware
i went to a couple of camera shops around dallas , tx , but apparently only kodak is service center in illinois has access to replacement parts
called kodak and got the address to send it to along with an authorization number
they wanted $342 to replace the firmware
it only cost $369 when new ! when i refused to pay this , they still charged me $45 to get it mailed back
i will never buy another kodak , and if this review sways others from buying a kodak - i will be happy
*kodak : this is terrible service and disrespect to customers who drop a lot of money for one of your products
*if anyone wants to offer me anything for this camera ( maybe someone out there knows how to repair it ) , feel free to contact me with an offer
( ) sorry , but amazon won not let me leave my email address
~joe pool
i am just an amateur photographer but in the past <NUM> years i have owned three 35mm slr cameras and two 35mm cameras
the kodak dc290 is my first digital and it operates about the same as the cameras
it can not do everything that an slr and a gadget bag full of accessories can do and it doesn not have the &quot ; feel&quot ; of an slr
but , it does <PERCENT> of what i want and produces beautiful photos
i have had mine for about four months and have taken almost <NUM> photos with it
last week i went to the usaf museum and took over <NUM> photos , about <NUM> of them with it on a tripod using shutter speeds of 0
5 to 3
0 seconds
fantastic quality
i bought an extra compact flash card ( 64m ) and two extra sets of nimh batteries and took along my old notebook pc
when the picture cards were full , i transferred the photos to the notebook pc using a pcmcia adapter then erased the card
that worked fine and i have not had any problems transferring files to my home pc using the usb port either
when you consider that we were spending over $200 per year on film and developing anyway , going digital just made sense
i like the ergonomics of the camera and the menus are easy to use - just spend a few minutes with the manual
i was switching between a variety of modes at the museum to get the best photos possible and it wasn not that difficult
i haven not had this much fun since i bought my first slr
coworkers were amazed by an 8x10 portrait of my wife that i took with the dc290 and printed on photo quality paper
kodak provides support through their web page including os upgrades to the camera is software
recommendations : get a case and one or two extra sets of nimh batteries
i haven not bought the ac adapter for it but i can see how it would be useful to some because it takes about <NUM> hours to recharge the batteries
the batteries will last longer if you use the viewfinder instead of the lcd
the lcd is essential for close up shots and the digital zoom only works with the lcd
a large compact flash card is a good idea if you intend to use the best quality at high resolution since the picture size in that format are usually around 500k
the graphics software that comes with the camera is ok but better programs are available for any serious photo editing you might want to do .
i use this camera for work , and i use it quite frequently
this is a very good camera , but not quite perfect
it has a lot of nice features that are standard on digital cameras these days , a nice lcd screen that eats the batteries away at an alarming rate , and is nicely contoured to hold
the picture quality is excellent for my line of work , which requires <NUM> x <NUM> photos , the resolution is excellent , and the colors are great ( as far as i can tell , anyway )
my favorite quality about this camera is the ease of loading the pictures on to the computer
just plug it in , it loads the program , and you pick your folder and the pictures are transferred
there are some negatives about this model , too
one is the size ; it is a bit large compared to other , smaller models
this may or may not be a problem for many people , but i prefer a smaller camera
the other is the power button ; you have to hold it down for an undisclosed amount of time to get it to go on/shut off
these are not big complaints , but the camera could have been better
kodak is customer service has been top notch .
it is a replacement for a ancient kodak gel imaging system
it looks that it has been through a lot , but works just fine
price was a bit high considering the age , feature and the condition of the thing .
you will hear consistently that this camera is slow , and to some degree this is true , however , it takes awesome pictures ! i have begun to print mine out ( even 8x10 is ) and this camera is just great
with the new price reduction , pick one up
you won not be sorry .
i have used this camera for a while now
pictures are good quality , and with the price of compactflash comming down it is a good deal
my only gripe is the compactflash slot is very fragile
if you switch cards a lot it may break
in such a case you will have to send kodak your camera , and they will send you a refurb back
i frankly was disapointed that my month old camera in great condition was replaced with a refurb that was obviously much older with obvious signs of wear and tear , plus a couple dead pixels on the display
all of which are considered &quot ; okay&quot ; by kodak
i really felt like i paid a new camera price for a used camera .
after much research , i finally decided to buy the dc290 as my first digital camera
the picture quality is great
kodak seems to get the best reviews when it comes to photographic fundamentals ; that is the selling point of this camera - the quality of the pictures is great
the color depth of these pictures is phenomenal , and under any lighting condition
you can get over <NUM> pictures on the 16mb card on the high quality setting , as good as a roll of film - or much more on the standard quality setting
the usb transfer is fast and easy , i don not think a card reader is necessary , so long as you have got the ac adapter ( not included ) to conserve battery life
the camera appears as a drive on your pc
the only major drawback of this camera plagues all digital cams from what i have read - battery life
it is really poor
i killed the first set in only a couple hours with minimal lcd screen use and this wasn not continuous use
even if you are conserving battery life by all means possible you will need a backup set of rechargables , or <NUM> or <NUM> backup sets
also , for [the price] they should have thrown in the ac adapter and maybe even a case .
kodak dc290 is fine for medium/long range subjects
however , because the viewfinder and the lens are , you invariably get results - unless you use the lcd as your main viewfinder ( this eats battery life and the display resolution makes it hard to make critical shot decisions )
however , the image quality is quite excellent for most outdoor/lighted conditions
the interaction and placement of the controls are quite good
there are a few key rubber finger and grip affordances to make the shooter feel in control
the only cheap part is the zoom lever
it is a small horizontal lever , that has to be kicked way over to one side or the other , and the time delay to lens movement is sluggish
the overall construction of the entire body and finish is very nice
there is plenty of standard features like burst , , etc
to keep most digital camera enthusiasts happy
a real nice package bonus was the 4 , aa nimh rechargeable batteries and charger + 16mb storage card
at least kodak was thinking about the entire user experience
oh , the pc software interface is rather silly
the childlike icons and metaphors for album creation , etc
makes you create a parallel cognitive hierarchy model for what is essentially folders/files on your computer
something more straight forward with clear icons and interface is all we want
use the quick access download near the clock once you have installed the software .
what can i say , right cable , right price
now adays you can easily be raped over the coals for quality cables , that was not the case with this monster cable it wass as expected with the twist of being reasonably price .
i bought these for my professional dj gig and the sound that comes out of these are really really clear
the thing that makes these cables great is the isolation from electrical interference ( power outlets , any power cables etc ) and i personally use it from my to a pioneer djm nexus mixer
couldn not be happier with the build quality
one small small con for me personally is that the cables are not stuck together so i would suggest get a half dozen or dozen of velcro straps to keep things neat .
these are great audio cables for the price
i highly recommend them
very nice build quality and appealing to the eye
so you know it is always the best ! it is all i use on all my older audio equipment , that still use line level audio output signals .
these are very good cables i use them for the big audio setup i have in my basement these sound absolutely amazing the highs are very well preserved the lows are very deep and the highs have very good detail the vocals of the midrange sound very good too i noticed that when i split open one of these to solder and shorten the cable that the internal conductors are not just stranded copper but they were a complicated frequency network wrapped in a way to take use of the skin effect which means higher frequencies sit more on outer conductors and bass is more in the middle the conductors inside the conductors are all individualy wrapped in their own insulation and are all pure copper the design inside is also the twisted pair in a way so it works simular to xlr or balanced cable it has silver solder contacts and the turbine connector/split tip make an extremely good almost direct connection to the audio equitment the rubberized jacket makes it very flexible and durable the cable is <PERCENT> shielded so no noise can be induced in the cable
overall this is one of the best cables i have bought and if you have a good sound system kick out the cheap cable and experience what a true audiophile wants in a great cable like this one .
these are great cables there nice and heavy after make sure the tip is screwed on tight only one drawback the slip off or wear out .
i beat my set of mk400s and i must say they suffered it withstyle
after smashing <NUM> pair of them into my car is din for a year i pulled out a pair and put them to work with my home theatre
they look good as new , and sound as fine as ever .
i will never forget the day i gave the order to throw away every single radio shack cable in the house .
i have a bunch of cables , from low to
i would rate them somewhere in the middle between the low end and the mid end in terms of audio quality
the connectors are a royal pain
they are way too tight which makes them very hard to plug in and even worse when its time to unplug them - they are so tight to a point one can damage the rca jack on the equipment
i wish i had kept the package otherwise these would be back for return in no time .
good price for a reason ? it may be defective , dont buy from market warehouse
the sound is rather dull but clean .
i was shopping for a stereo cable and had good success with monster cables previously
what i received were two completely separate ( but ) mono cables -- i immediately sent them back for a refund
i expected a joined double cable
amazon is photos do not clearly show that the cables are separate , nor is there anything in the detailed description about this
i already have too many cables behind my cabinets and on my floor -- why would i want two more when one double cable would suffice ? conclusion : the photos are misleading and the description is incomplete .
this company has been around a long time for a reason
good quality cables with no distortion or feedback with a great price
cables fit tightly and provided an excellent connection
just exactly what i was looking for and the free shipping is always a bonus .
very good quality cable
the fit is very tight so i'd recommend this for someone who has no plans of taking them out often .
for many years and no other producer of cabeling has the high quality of monster for a very reasonable price
as one reviewer pointed out , on venues like ebay/amazon ( amazon is not responsible for items on their site but quickly makes restitution ) , make sure you check to see that the connection "grips" are not plastic
there are a lot of those floating around
i have used monster for interconnects and speaker cables and have never had a problem
my equipment is "pricey" to say the least .
my system always sounded great and used to use radioshack is gold cable is
i got these cause they were here on amazon where i bought my new dvd player
these cables are a lot more hefty than anything i have ever seen
i didn not compare quality to any other cables so i don not know about sound quality but it does sound good
if you are like me you probably want to spend more time infront of the tv than behind it .
i have had this cable for about <NUM> months
it made an immediate difference to my system
it sounds clear , transparent , smooth
also , i like the directional indicators on the cable which help in installation
my only gripe is that the connectors are cheaply made
when one of the &quot ; grab&quot ; pins broke off , i realized the connector is not all metal construction ( like you would expect for the price )
the pin was made of plastic - quite a disappointment
i hoped for better at this price .
these aren not exactly audiophile grade , but work well in my application
these were a special buy available through amazon and were at about 1/3 the list price
the cable jacket and connectors are sturdy
at the price , i would definitely buy these again for &<HASHTAG> ; all purpose&<HASHTAG> ; usage .
there is quite a bit of controversy out there on monster
i really don not want to dive into it but if you feel its over priced , i suggest you google the difference between monster digital cables ( hdmi , optical , etc ) and monster analog cables , such as this rca cable
i am only an audio enthusiast but i worked in radio shack back in the day when it was still radio shack
if your going to tell me some razor thin , high gauge rca cable is going to not only save me money but sound just as good as the monster
then i wish you the best with your sound setup but your missing out
shielding matters quite a lot when it comes to analog cables and this cable doesn not disappoint
i also like the fact its about <PERCENT> off the regular price if purchased from amazon
i purchased these for my father in law who saw an instant improvement in sound quality for his ht
i did give the product <NUM> star off as it does have the infamous , super tight connectors
i understand why monster wants to do it but they should develop an easier method of twisting and pulling to get them off .
i ordered several different brands of fiber optic cable to try , so i have not opened the packaging for this item
however , the packaging and product looks like a high quality product as can be expected from monster cable .
monster has a reputation for making great cables , but this series does not live up to monster is reputation
all other monster cables that i have used are substantial , but the connectors on this model ( series ) are not made to last , are flimsy and fall apart after time
( cables should last longer than a receiver )
this cable is worth every penny
the connector is beautiful
the "m" in monster is wonderfully printed and the finger grips feel like work of art
other than the connector , i don not have much to say about this cable compared to other toslink cables
the innards are really all the same
i can say that there is a marked improvement over the extended coathanger i had been using previously to connect my receiver to my audio equipment .
nothing wrong with this cable : 1
it is a brand name
the length is <NUM> meter or 3
28 feet - ideal for most component connections
it snaps in and out securely but not too easy to get disconnected ( i have read reviews of other cables with that problem )
thirteen bucks shipped .
yeah , i don not get this obsession with monster brand cable either
when i got my 5
1 , i thought the only way to get 5
1 sound was to use an optical wire anyway
well , on my system it was , as it had no rca jacks for all those discrete channels
all it has is one optical jack and one set of l/r rca jacks for a stereo vcr source
so all i did was go to wal mart or radio shack ( can not remember which ) and bought the only optical cable they had for like <NUM> bucks
works just fine
my problem if anything is my receiver
but i think i will be upgrading sometime later this year .
all monster cables are overpriced
avoid being if at all possible
they are high quality though , so that is why they charge too much .
i wanted a cable to connect from my computer to my bose system
this does the job admirably .
there will always be agruments about whether monster cables are worth the money , and i think a lot of it depends on your personal situation
i'd suggest going for the cheapo radio shack cables first , and only upgrade if the perfomance is not satisfactory
you will save money more often than not
i bought this set to install in my car for a trunk mounted mp3 adapter , so i needed extra length and suspected that noise immunity would be needed as well
they work fine , and i have no complaints , but i do want to point out that they are very bulky
the molded base of the 3
5mm jack is almost as big as my mp3 player , and the cable is like a garden hose !
i used to buy the cheapest available cables for stereo connections
i found out over the years , that the sound quality was not real good , using the cheaper cables
that being said , my computer is on one side of the room , and my tv on the other
i thought i was going to make the connection with several shorter cables
this particular cable is <NUM> ft
long , and very well made
it fit my needs perfectly .
this cable performs well and is a bargain for the person who wants to sit back and connect his computer to his tv with hdmi
it couldn not have been easier .
i can not say whether they are worth the money , becuase i haven not tried similar products
however , they do work well , and they are built to survive a long time
they are incredibly thick for audio cables
if you are imagining something the thickness of the typical headphone or wire , you are in the wrong ballpark : this is closer to the thickness of a wire
it is massive
nay , monstrous
the wire is still very supple and easy to manipulate
however , if you plan to run it across your living room floor , it will be extremely conspicuous
although you could certainly use it as a permanent connection , its massive construction suggests that the intended use is probably in a setting where you will be frequently connecting and disconnecting , packing and unpacking , and generally giving the cord heavy use
it looks like it will take this kind of abuse fairly well
the end .
i had this about a year and mysteriously nothing plugged into it worked
thought i had blown a breaker
finally figured out this thing just suddenly stopped working
no reset
no on/off
just stopped working
seems to be a lot of this happening with this strip
now i have to spend more money on a good one .
this product is highly recommended - i have bought several for multiple appliances .
i bought this to replace my cheap $2 strip , and i feel better protected when using it with my $$$$ photo lighting system
i am sure the $2 strip would function just the same , but i used to sell monster cable back when the good guys was in business , and this stuff always made a difference ! it doesn not cost a little more just for the name
it costs more cause it performs , and is worth it !
i would give this five stars if it weren not for the ugly colors
it is a great product and offered for a great price
i think the price is lower because of the ugly colors
it is nice that it is labeled for different entertainment inputs though
they are color coated , they just make it look like a weird rainbow
i still like it though and highly recommended the product .
so i guess i have never really put this thing through the test but i do live in an area where there are power outages
no damage to any of my components ( sony 27" crt tv ; onkyo home theater in a box system ; sony dvd player ; comcast motorola cable box )
not sure if it was the monster hat protected it or not but no problems
color code is convenient and plug is flat to hug the wall
good price .
this product works great for flat screen tv is with the tv on the wall , it hangs perfectly and is ealy to manipulate .
i love the thick plug wire plus the offset of it
i am using it for my xbox 360 , receiver , and hdtv .
works just like it is supposed to , no problems & it does exactly what i purchased it for .
it is great to have the for each of your components , and i believe that monster is a reliable brand
it may have been nice to have a coax connection to protect my sat receiver , but i am a bit dubious of the actual utility of coax connection surge suppressors
i suspect that , in general , surges are very rare or nonexistent from satellite dishes to the receivers , unless brought on by a lightening strike , in which case , any surge suppressor would be unlikely to withstand the strike
because of this , i saw this particular power protector as the perfect solution for my needs .
a pimped out surge protector for the most expensive tech gear
sure , it might be a bit overpriced , but you get what you pay for .
i honestly have always trusted and loved monster cable
i have an <NUM> thousand dollar home entertainment center that is completely setup using nothing by monster cable wires
while i know that they are a little overpriced at times , there is a lot to be said for peace of mind and also knowing that you systems are connected using the best wires and power sources money can buy
i bought this as a bedroom outlet strip because i have a few things plugged in near my bed and also bought a bose sound dock and didn not want to plug it into a cheap power strip from the dollar store
i have been very happy with this and it is worked perfectly for the first <NUM> months of owning it
additionally , with the <NUM> or so monster cable items i have bought in the last <NUM> years , not one of them have failed on me or delivered nothing but top notch performance
if you can about what you are plugging into it , get a monster cable power source .
performing as described and i like it so far but i guess the real test is when there is a power surge
i hopw that won not happen but it did , then i will edit the review if necessary
on july <NUM> 2007 i received from amazon the monster cable mp av600 power protector and the belkin surgemaster superior series surge protector ( 6' , <NUM> joules )
they both sold for about the same price
the monster is vastly inferior
the belkin has three times the joules rating
the belkin is much more attractive and well designed
the monster is just a squarish standard strip that felt very cheap compared to the belkin and worst of all the monster had a bad rubber stink and the cord felt gritty
the belkin had a smooth white power cord
my other mistake was to get the belkin with the <NUM> foot cord , i realized a <NUM> foot cord was available after ordering
you will be much happier with the belkin
i will post this exact review with the belkin as well
last time i gave something <NUM> star amazon did not display it
maybe the higher end monster models are nicer .
it is a powerstrip
and it is easy to see the plugs
does what it should and feels well made
the end .
added this to my <NUM> gallon aquarium setup liking it so far its tucked out the way now my aquarium equipment will be protected
i purchased a new tv for christmas with a blu ray player
i lose power a lot where i live when we get thunder storms
i got this to protect my electronics .
this surge protector comes with an unusually long cord making it easy to plug in multiple items with varying lengths of cord
the color coded outlets and coordinating , enclosed labels help to maintain organization
great buy .
this is a simple easy power strip
i went to college so i know you don not have to plug the vcr in to the vcr color plug
it doesn not accommodate lots wall warts
also be careful of which way power converters are aligned
also nice long cord .
this is your basic surge protector strip , with right angle plug and plugs for various components
i have for a year and is still working
good product , very reliable
good signage to know what plugs are for what
packaging needs to be more eco friendly .
monster stakes out a claim as being the best in audio equipment
but this surge protector does not live up to the brand name
after a year or two of use , only two of the six outlets work
when i began to have the problem and contacted monster , i found myself on hold forever again and again and was provided with no helpful solution to my problem or easy way to have the device replaced
i have other brand surge protectors that have been rocking strong since the 1980s
this one has been a disappointment
the only reason i am on amazon today is that i am shopping to replace this one .
this surge protector is great
i like the colors , not because i actually plug anything in to certain pliugs , but because it makes it easier to see when you are plugging in items while reaching behind cabinets and what not
the size of the strip seems to be slightly larger , which makes for an easier fit with multiple items connected
i have also had some bad power surges in my house and this item has managed to handle them all very well
i even lost my microwave over one , but my tv and game console were just fine after the surge ! monster makes a superior product ! short and sweet : buy this to protect your stuff !
can not say a lot about a plug strip except that for about <NUM> bucks this is very hard to beat and from a major brand monster , not really know for entry level pricing on their products
i like the color coding in addition to the pack of cable lables that let you mark what the plug is to/from , i usually make on with masking tape and a magic marker but this is a lot cleaner : ) great product and at a very good price .
this is an excellent unit and does what it is supposed to do
makes it easy to shut off several circuits at once
i like it .
it does the job and i have not had any problems with it so far
i would order more when needed .
for the function at this price , good
for the very good construction and thorough design to match the monster quality , awesome !
bought a few of these to be surge supressors or power bars at various locations around the house
the price was right
could not complain as it does the job .
waste of money
it doesnt hold on to the plugs
buy the belkin
better quality fer sure
worth the money , too .
i have had one of these for several years
recently , i needed to get another surge protector
i went to target to buy one and all they had were only 3ft or <NUM> ft cords and were $20+
i looked this one up and was amazed that a monster product was only <NUM> bucks
what a deal
a name brand at a generic price
plus it has an <NUM> foot cord
the colors are cool if you frequently changed plugs but for me its just plug in and forget .
i ordered this surge protector to protect a laptop and associated electronics at a desk in my house
the slim design makes it take up less room behind the laptop
the right angle outlets allow two regular cords to be plugged in at the same time as two , so i can only use four of the six outlets
designed for equipment which have standard wall plugs , all six outlets are available
the long power cord allows for convenient positioning even when not close to the wall outlet
i have since ordered more for other locations in the house
the outlets are labeled for function , but all appear to be identical .
i did not rate this five stars because the flat male plug is on <NUM> degrees
that is fine if the electrical receptacle is left of where it is intended to be used but if the receptacle is to the right , cord will go off in the wrong direction till you can double it back
also would be nice if it came in optional white or beige
the heavy black cord doesn not look good in our living room .
the two big selling points of this product for me was1
extra long cord length2
excellent build qualitythe product came with outlets and some sticker ribbons for the user to attach to the cords themselves
these are helpful , except when you want to plug in something that is not audio / video related
( not really that big of an issue though
just love the color code to know which plug to pull or to insert what where it belongs
don not have any complaints about this unit .
price was great only $10 but after getting <NUM> units , all three had cheesy construction
there was difficulty inserting plugs in all <NUM> units and after <NUM> weeks one unit completely failed on me
the reset button never popped and there was a smell from the failed unit that usually indicates melting or fused electrical components
no damage to items plugged in but i would advise all not to buy this outlet strip
> the second strip failed on me the same way after a couple of weeks usage replacing the first one
only one of the three is still working
you get what you pay for
i cannot understand how anyone rates this as a good item
i looks great and has a great cord but fails miserably
the proverbial book by the cover story
i will never buy monster products again
i have never had this poor a performance on a power strip in all my life
i did not get any electrical damage to what was plugged in when the failure was incurred but who needs the headache potential
pass on it here
since i cant give zero stars , i guess one will have to do
no power surge , no electrical storm , no brown out , no sparks , nor puff of smoke
it just stopped working
the reset button did not even pop out
i should have gotten the apc or suppressor
pros : nice long flexible cable that hopefully i can on another project
cons : difficult to insert plugs into
mysteriously stopped working after amazon return period expired
if this was a joke , then it wasn not even funny
i have like <NUM> of these things in the house ; radio shack , belkin , and apc and none of them has ever died in less than <NUM> months , let alone ever
i even sold my first suppressor ! if i have to pay a dollar to return it then it goes in the garbage bin .
it is a great power strip
you can color code to which device goes to which plug
i just wish it had one more plug to completely meet my needs
the plugs are also spaced enough to allow just about any plug size without interfering with the next
a solid power strip .
just bought one at best ___ for $29
95 plus tax
needed it for big tv that was arriving earlier than expected otherwise would have done it via amazon
there price is just about <PERCENT> less
ps : also wrote review on how my new 58" tv was an $1100 dollar savings via amazon as well .
the angled power plug keeps it from being knocked out of the socket by the bed - just exactly what we have been needing for many years !
my nephew wanted this for christmas to plug in all his equipment
he loves it very much
i am going to get one for myself .
if yer color blind , ya may not want this , but for those of you that are like the rest of us , this is a good power strip
the plug end does not swivel like the belkin model
i had to pull out the receptacle from the wall and turn it over so that the power cable would point downward .
i now have this power strip in every room of my house
i plug all my vampire electronic products into it and turn off one switch to economize on the electricity drain of many electronics when they are not in use
this is a good looking power strip with a flat angled plug that sits close to the wall outlet
the cord is 6' long .
this power surge protector has plugs sideways , which works well for many devices with large plugs
it was a good price for a brand name product .
good power protection device ; colorful does not do anything in particular .
i purchased this as a lightning deal , figuring that i needed another power strip
after i received it , i was shocked and very pleased with the length of the cord for the power strip
i had planned on using it for something else but when i saw it is monster capacity i changed out the power strip in my bedroom to plug my entertainment system into along with my computer
i am very pleased and cannot believe the steal i got on this .
i was always concerned about the spacing between points of such devices
same happens here , these are too closely spaced and some of the chargers eat up so much space not letting you place more than <NUM> or <NUM> devices at a time
cannot complain too much of this because it is understood clearly from the device and its description and pictures
other than this , its such an awesome device
i really appreciate how each plug is
i was able to &<HASHTAG> ; sharpie&<HASHTAG> ; the plug to match the color of the plug and it makes finding which cord goes to which device easy
love it !
i bought this as a gift for my husband and it works perfectly
we were looking for a power strip that faced to the side rather than to the skinny end ( hope that makes sense )
this did exactly what we wanted ( even though we didn not use it for a tv ! )
great value for a monster branded product
so far so good ! seems to hold up and love the color code on the bar vs
having to put a tag on each plug .
good surge protector for the price
outlets are not too close to each other
seams sturdy
the labels such as "vcr" or "tv/sat" are completely unnecessary but they don not hurt anything .
the color coding is of only somewhat value
the important thing is that the plug to the wall is flat
the cord is also a decent length .
i don not know what some of you are talking about when you say that this is an inferior product
monster is a really good , quality brand
the outlets are tight , so you don not have to worry about your cords coming out and losing power
it might be a bit much , but it is not that hard to get in
someone said they had to put their full weight into it to get plugged in , they must be a wimp since a small guy like me was able to easily push it in with a little force
it looks a bit fruity , but it works really well
plus the long cable is nice to have since none of my outlets are near my computer desk .
i like the warranty
too bad their made out of the country ; you want americans to buy your stuff , but you don not employ them so they have the money
think about it
the money you save- you lose .
failed after two months of use while only having a <NUM> inch tv plugged into it
inferior monster product
i wouldn not buy again
it seemed a good price for the item but not worth the headache .
the av600 looks like a pretty standard power strip with bright colors painted on to help you organize and categorize your connections
stickers and cable guides come with the strip to help you organize
the strip seems to be well built , but i really can not say for sure whether it can live up to its claims
i guess only an independent testing lab could do that
as far as the rated protection level , you could probably find another power protector that has a higher rating for a similar price
however , my experience with the monster branded products has been favorable , so i really bought this item based on the company reputation and past experience
one benefit of this power protector is that you can plug it in with the flat power connector and move your furniture ( if applicable ) close to the wall , unlike normal power strips where the plug sticks way out
if you have really high end equipment , or live in florida as i do , i would recommending spending a little extra for more 'protection' .
well , i am not going to test the thing for it is endurance , but it does supply power to my less expensive home theatre system , i wish it has a higher rating for being a monster cable powersupply , but it works just fine .
works like any power strip should and the quality of the cable on this feels very nice , its thick but not to stiff at all
the only complaint i have is on a few of these i bought some of them are hard to plug into like it may be off inside the device ( possible quality issue )
but works with no issues .
and works - i don not really make use of the colors but i find it attractive
i just put a plug in the holes and that is that
really this one is constantly in use and things go in and out and that is good for me
my phone charger , hair dryer , ipad charger etc
very convenient and attractive .
we were watching tv tonight , and all off a sudden , my tv and box go on and off and on and off , while everything else stayed on my house
next thing i know , the house smells like burnt electronics
this "quality" surge protector was sizzling
i am surprised the circuit didn not break
i am now on amazon buying a new surge protector , but will not buy this .
very useful and simple surge protector find much use out of it when hooking up different components of my home theater system also it pre labeled as well as color coded which can be very useful when connecting various different items .
uh , it is a power strip so what is to say ? it works
you plug things into it , and they work
actually the best thing about this one is it comes with little stickers that you can attach to the end of plugs on your electrical devices so if you unplug something , you will know what it is ! though , it should include blank ones so you can name things yourself such as ps2 or router , things like that
anyhow this was a great price and this seller ships real quick so you can not lose .
this keeps me from buying a new computer
have bought about <NUM> of these due to lightning strikes and they have saved my computer ever time .
well what can you really say about a surge protector ? it works as to shutting of the electrical equipment when you switch the button on or off
i don not know if it will shut down if damaging electrical spikes comes but i expect it does
the size of the product is slim and does not take up much room
the color coded receptacles are very nice and i am very happy i purchased it for the $14
99 low price amazon was selling it for .
contrary to many negative reviews claiming this fails quickly , i haven not experienced that with either of my two
they are both still working correctly
one with my home theater , and the other with a pc
i will update this review if i have any problems .
this is a great brand for the features and price
the main feature i needed was the flat profile wall plug
having a 24k plated connector , color coded outlets and <NUM> ft cord were definite pluses
hard to find a better deal on a quality product like this !
looks and feels nice , but broke after two weeks
i used it for rather high power appliances ( 3kw total ) though .
i like the color coding and labeling i just wish i could write in my own labels
good product , would buy another one .
i like this a lot
it has a longer cord than most power strips
it is also a soft cable so it is easy to organize
for the discounted price , this is a super deal on a great strip .
this thing works well and the cable has a pretty decent length on it
the colors are nice to set things up and know what is what without having to label it yourself
i have had it for a few months and it is still going strong .
this is a great power strip
the warranty endorsed is great as well
recommend to anyone
specially at this price .
it is a really good product , & i only deducted a star because what i wanted to plug into it was really too wide to fit them all
that isn not the fault of the strip though , and it is made very well with the 8ft cord making a huge difference .
this item failed after one month of use
there seem to be two breakers in this item : the first one is tied to the "reset" button
this circuit is closest to the shared socket side
the second one is tied to the "on/off switch"
this circuit is closest to the wall side
the on/off switch is still lit up
however , none of the devices are getting power
the reset button is useless and does not work
this item will be returned .
i bought this power strip about 1
5 years ago
it is still working well
i also like that the colorful design makes it look a little nicer than the ordinary power strip .
i got this as a deal of the day and it was worth every penny
monster products are great quality ( but somewhat expensive ) , so when you can get them on sale they are definitely worth purchasing , as i know it will last for years and years .
i have used monster surge protectors in the past and had no reason to complain but when put to the test , this one totally failed me
this is your basic surge protector strip , with right angle plug and plugs for various components
but does it give them sufficient protection ? unfortunately it did not for me
i was using it for my combination and a bad storm one day fried the hard drive in my tivo
so dock a few stars for it failing to properly protect my device
so now i get to experience this monster warranty process
suffice to say , you will be lucky if you get anything out of them , or can fulfill the requirements and <NUM> pages of information they want you to send them
in my case , i have a tivo dvd that no one within several hundred miles of me is "authorized" to repair as they require , and they require an inspection of the damaged equipment by such a technician prior to filing a claim
i have to order a replacement part on the internet , which they don not accept and they won not reimburse after the fact
you also have to pay to send the surge protector back to them for inspection as well , so basically you have to spend a significant amount of money to file a claim and may get absolutely nothing out of it
so basically , the warranty in a lot of cases is of little use and not worth the trouble they put you through versus just paying for repairs yourself
so you can dock another star or two for that
so while i like the design of this surge protector , i probably will go looking for another one that will properly protect my equipment at least .
love the color coding
makes it easy to know which plug is which
i have no complaints and love the price .
what can i say , its a power strip with added colors to show you what goes where
thats pretty much it , overall it works , the wall plug is sturdy , cable gauge is quite rugged and high quality .
i am using this off of my ups for extra equipment i maybe testing or using
compaired to other multi strips you can not beat the quality and price
maybe a limited deal so not sure if still available .
the flat plug easily plugs in behind my dresser without bending the cord
the cord is <NUM> ft as described and long enough for my needs ( reach from plug behind dresser to window )
i am not crazy about the colors but it is a fine design
everything was as described and it works perfectly .
this is a no frills simple power strip
i user it for a secondary entertainment center for my tv , cable box and dvd player
the power strip does it is job
it does not have any power cleaning activity
the strip is a little bulky , but not too bad
for the cost it fits the need and the risk tolerance i wanted to pay for .
this has been excellent for my computer and and other accessories , i have been utilizing with my computer
since my purchase everything has been running very excellently .
the cord is long and that`s why i like to use this
i have over 12
recently however the price spiked and hope it`s only a temp supply issue it`s a good value and good build qual for the $
recieved as a gift , used it for less than <NUM> year & it completely stopped working
had my computer plugged into it when the strip blew out
thankfully the computer is fine , the strip got thrown in the trash
would not recommend
you pay for what you get .
i was concerned because of the price , i thought that this item could have a regular quality , but its very good
i feel safe
monster is a great company with high quality standards .
very good power protector for the price
i liked it is long thick cord thats why i brought <NUM>
i brought it to replace my other brand defective power outlet .
these are my powerstrips of choice , because of the super long cords and the angled plug that allows for tigh fits behind appliances , desks , dressers , etc
only bad part about these are : everytime i buy one , i wish i would have purchased more at the time , because it always seems as though i need another one .
over the years , i have purchase at least five of these monster power strips
i like that the cord is longer than most and the color coding system helps keep cords organized .
whether you are a fan of monster or not , the price is right even though it doesn not sound as fancy as the other surge protectors .
your standard power strip , with surge protection
does the job , outlets aren not inaccessible and plugs go in just fine
colors are a bit obnoxious and the labels are completely unnecessary if you need this for other applications , but it works just fine
and it comes with a rounded plug that stays out of the way and doesn not obscure more than one outlet .
i ordered two of these in june 2011 , and have not had any problems with them whatsoever
great product and a great price !
it works just fine and my wife is happy with it
it replaced a generic model which had three failed outlets
we have always had great experiences with our monster power strips and surge protectors , so i expect this one will do just fine .
works great ! there is not much else to say
have an hdtv , player , and satellite receiver hooked up
still working !
i have been using this product for last one month now with connection to <NUM> inch lcd , xbox and sound system , works perfect
i think with the price tag this is optimum for the intened use
good product and the seller too ( packing/delivery good ) overall thus rating <NUM>
a good deal for a quality product
monster has the best protection
amazon makes it affordable with their free shipping .
i recommend this power strip to all ! the color coded graphic labels are great
light weight and durable construction is the bomb !
just what i needed for the problem i had
i would recommend it for those who have a need of a power strip .
for a monster product , this guy is kind of cheaply made
like another reviewer said , it just kind of feels cheap
i know its just a power strip , and thats why a bought a cheaper one , but it seems a bit inferior for a monster product
i am really no fan of theirs , but at least their products look and feel as if they are better than the rest
this one , however , seems like it would fall apart with minimal abuse
i have another apc brand surge protector that my computer stuff is plugged into that is far and away superior to this thing .
does the job
everything i buy on amazon i research it first , then i read the reviews before i buyi always get a decent product
monster mp av600 power protectorso much better than cheap units
our electric service is suspect , no more holes blown from cheap units into the carpeting !
this product is very useful and when i couldn not find anymore outlets , this has helped me in a variety of ways and now i have unlimited number of outlets .
i do like monster power products but you certainly pay a premium to get them
that is okay - it is slim , has plenty of plugs , and works
after a lightening strike that blew out some other electrical items , this item was still running strong , so that is good
i don not know if it mattered ( the fuse box took most of the hit ) but still , i am glad my tv etc
didn not blow up .
in an area of the country where there are frequent electrical storms in the spring and summer months , it is important to have all your audio/video computers and smart phones protected from static discharge
there are some cheaper strips out there , but monster has been in the business for a long time and it is worth a few extra dollars not to lose that 1500
00 flat panel tv to a static discharge !
there are too many quality power strips out there to waste your money on this one
the number of failed strips ( now <NUM> one star reviews ) is an indication of just how risky it is to buy this item
the strip powers on but there is no power going to anything that is plugged into it
pure garbage .
i needed additional power strips and this fit the bill
there is nothing fancy about this strip minus the colors and the labels
while it is nice for you to have labels so you don not have to follow the cord most of the time the labels will not fit what you are going to plug in there and will just have label them yourself anyway
if you have the larger plugs like cell phone chargers you are probably going to take up two plugs as they are close together and not really angled for it .
its a monster and quality built , but only good for standard plug cords
i would rather have seen the plugs run down the strip instead of across it .
i like the color coding of the power strip and it is a better strip than most cheap strips found in regular retail stores
cords are good quality
i prefer monster cables to cheaper makes and models .
i got a good deal on this
i didn not buy it because it was monster brand
i am not a monster fanboi or anything
i just saw it go on sale and got a good deal and i needed one
i like the layout of the plugs
it gives you a good variety of spaces for transformers , etc
i have all my computer and stereo equipment plugged into it and it hasn not missed a beat
works for me !
i have been literally moving my tv stand for years to unplug/plug in equipment
well , frankly , my knees are getting too old for these shenanigans and we have a lot of lightning in our area
i bought this item so that i could shut down equipment and plug/unplug with ease
i particularly like the color coding for the different plugs , because that tangled spaghetti behind my tv stand is pretty hard to decipher
the shipping was fast , and packed well
i could not ask for more .
i mean its a simple power center , it works , i hope it doesnt fail , but you wont find out until its to late
hope the brand name will stand up to their previous rep
this thing is huge , it really is a monster
but it works great
i have every confidence that i am getting clean reliable power and surge protection
as well as great cable length
it is easy to identify products by the included color labels and logos on the device , and offers superior cable management options
all around a great product .
i buy these for home and at work and they are great
one of the best power strips on the market that have good spacing so if you have larger power supplies it doesn not keep you from using the plug next to it
i have several of these and have never had one fail
it comes with a cable connector but i have never used it
i like that they also include some ties and the sticker labels for your equipment
for the money , you can not beat it .
this is so much more sturdy and safe than the typical power strips ! the plug fits fairly flush to the wall socket and the sockets on it hold plugs securely without being too tight
i don not use the cable protectors so i can not speak to that
i highly recommend this to anyone needing a reliable , safe power strip .
i bought two and all the pieces to a new desktop , they have plenty of space and colored plug ins
it made everything very easy to set up .
it is nice to have the color coding to easily see which cord is which
there is no phone or ethernet protection
fits a lot of cords in a fairly compact space .
monster is one of my favorite brands
this works great and i love the color coded labeling that lets me see at a glance what i am unplugging without having to trace it back to the particular unit
good job monster
the rest of you , buy this !
it actually replaced the exact same one i already had
reason being , my portable heater/fireplace kicked on while i had my stero surrond sound unit and my big screen t
on all at the same time
it surged and all units shut down immediately , and the surge protector set off an alarm
saved me about <NUM> grand
highly recommend this unit .
let me start by saying that i have another monster unit that protects my front room is electronics and i needed a new protector for my bedroom
this product meets my needs ; it protects a tv , sat box , ps3 , and a hard drive enclosure
the protector is good quality and has a strong and long cord
if you do not care that it is labeled for a vcr and don not run coaxial or telephone cable i highly recommend this product .
very easy to use and durable even with my heater
i tested it for two weeks during the day and the power surge was still cool to touch .
produto de primeira linha
cumpre o que promete
robusto , bom acabamento e resistente
item imprescind&iacute ; vel para montar um conjunto de home theater .
then there was suddenly a weird ringing sound and everything plugged into it turned off
i need better reliability than that !
what can i really say ? it does what it is supposed to , or at least i think as i haven not run across any power issues
i have always been happy with monster products and thus far this is no exception .
if you want to pay $100 for this then go to your local retail store and buy their older model for 3x the price
this things is protecting/powering my onkyo 7
1 , blu ray , satellite , 47" lcd w/ zero problems
if you are thinking about this think no more and buy it now !
i love this item
i researched before buying and truly believe the monster cable one is one of the better ones on the market
glad i bought this partucular one
easy to use .
the product met expectations and was adequate for my home theater system , including tv , player , audio video receiver , cd player , and cable modem and cable tv box .
bought 2 , they worked flawlessly , monster brand is premium quality at a premium price ! i would recommend this to my friends !
for your audio/visual equip
i have my samsung tv as well as ps3 , surround sound , nes , and atari hooked to this and passed through multiple storms safely .
i purchased this item because i wanted a surge protector and to know what plug connected to what device
it works great ! never pull out the wrong plug anymore and always know which plugs are going to which device
have no complaints
have only had this product for about <NUM> months now thought , also enjoy how many outlets there are
nice product which is color coded to help assist in controlling the maze of electrical cords to our home theater/stereo system .
strait forward design and everything is labeled if you can not see colors and color coded if you can not read
if you need one , this one works .
i do not have any complaints , is a good surge protection
monster is premium quality at a premium price in the market
we bought the first one for our tv set up & loved it so much i bought a second one for my home office
we live in florida which next to al is the lightening storm capital of the us
so far out power has gone out but our toys are still working .
tucked it away into my console - it is always there ! i plug everything into this thing - including the vacuum cleaner !
this is exactly what i wanted and i found the best price for it here
i couldn not have ask for a better deal .
the fact that these are discontinued is quite a shame
these were my go to power surge protectors for the longest time
i will miss these !
i was having major issues with lesser surge protectors being able to keep up with the constant a/c usage and allowing me to use the lamp and laptop without blowing the circuit or the protector
this bad boy is compact ( when you factor in all of the plugs you get , has a convenient side plug , which allows it to fit snugly behind my couch , and this sucker does the job !
used this for my tv
it had plenty of places to plug in the components
and it had a good joule rating .
i rated it <NUM> stars because it is a great protector for the price
you have ample ways of hooking up all your pieces
of course , this one is discontinued but i am sure they made the newer model even better
don not know if it actually works because we haven not been hit by lightening or anything
i have faith though .
i was looking or a large capacity labelled surge protector and found it
great price and quality and i will probably purchase another .
i originally ordered this for use at my entertainment center to support my video and audio equipment
the layout of the outlets allows for three type boxes to be used while still using the other five outlets for regular power cords
the power cord is also very long , so placement is easy
this versatility has resulted in my purchasing others for use in other locations in the house
i do not use the coaxial surge protectors , but i probably should with all the lightning we have in arizona .
it seems like people have a &<HASHTAG> ; beef&<HASHTAG> ; with monster cables
i don not get it
i have purchased many of their products and they are well designed , well made , and protect your electronics
are there products as good out there ? perhaps but this is a great one and it is fairly inexpensive
i can not say the same for some of the product lines mentioned by other reviewers here as superior
in my experience monster products stand the test and i will continue to buy from this company .
this product is everything it promises
i had investigated other options before buying , but you never know until you open the package and use the product
good value item !
saved money and got the right product to protect my new hd tv and ps3
same product but lower than local big box retailer .
worked as intended
at the end of the day , it is just another extension , and all tat color stuff just a waste of time .
it is not the prettiest thing in the world , but it is very functional , and is great for hooking up multiple items with power bricks
i have had this up and running for quite some time , and have no had a single issue with it
the cord from the wall to the strip is very long , so setting up the power strip away from an outlet is a very viable option
for $20 , it is hard to go wrong .
i have <NUM> monster surge protectors , and two are this exact model - av800
it offers great peace of mind at great price
i like the protection against the surge from the tv antenna
i highly recommend it .
no signal lose or connection issues to report
the sockets are easy to get to and coaxial connection was a breeze .
plenty of space between the plugs for those bigger adapters
comes with stickers to label all of your cords
there color coated to the plug color , so no more hoping you unplug the right plug .
i was looking for an inexpensive surge protection unit that would safe guard my av equipment
i was a little skeptical because of the price
this unit appears to be made well
i like its simplicity and it is size
this is a recommended purchase .
just the surge protector i needed , comes color coded so you can easyly find what is hooked up to that plug ! great !
didn not need anything fancy to plug in my media
the price is right and it works perfectly
power surges are not common here , but i am ready for 'em !
it is what it is
works perfect however when you read the directions in the package , honestly
there is no warrantee
your entire house would have to be grounded to this one unit in order for it to cover the damage from a power surge
that is what homeowners is all about
if you are worried about your saved computer stuff
then get a cloud
although , i do not regret making this purchase .
when on sale , you can not beat it
monsters surge protectors have never failed me and the warranty is solid
i don not trust thousands of dollars of tv & stereo to straight in the wall or cheap no name brands from the local walmart
get 'em on sale and you will always fly that way .
i buyed this surge protection and i live in a country with 220vthis product dont support 220v what a shame ! at least put that info in the product details or some where ! 40$ in shipping on the trash !
i have had this for about a year and it has done it is job
i don not unplug it when there is a thunderstorm so if there is a powerspike in the line , it must be catching it .
i purchased one of these a while back for my large screen tv and related components and i also purchased another just recently for my computer and components , great product for added protection .
monster surge protectors and power strips are excellent and offer plenty of outlet space
bought three for my home office and they are doing the job with ease
i absolutely would recommend them to anyone .
usually these monster surge protectors come with a steeper price because they are supposedly built with high quality materials
well i havent yet been able to prove if its true or not and maybe thats a good thing lol
well the product works as intended and at a great price , i love the colored sockets help separate the appliances .
here is the deal
i don not know or understand much about surge protectors
i just know that when you but new electronics , you should buy a new surge protector suitable to the product you are buying .
all my surge protectors/outlets are all monster cable
quality brand
i do wish the length of the a/c cord could be a little longer
i think it is about <NUM> feet long
they should make an extended a/c cord version like <NUM> feet or something
otherwise , stick with monster cable
we have a lot of power surges and if you don not want to fry your equipment a surge protector is a must
a greatproduct with amazon is big discount and usual super fast shipping .
the product arrived broken
i could hear parts loose inside so i rma it
it kind of make u wonder what kind of monster product your getting for <NUM> dollars
u have to be careful when ordering stuff online , make sure your not getting chinese replicas
although this product looks like a monster product i highly doubt it was .
i am a bit of a geek about this stuff but this is everything you would want in a power strip
it is got both cable and phone cord protection , wide spaced plugs on one side for off shape plugs and color coded plugs on the other side
it comes with little color coded tags you put on the cords of your appliances so you know what you are unplugging when it is time to change something in the entertainment center
extra long chord is just icing on the cake
will be buying more of these later .
surge protector are not someting i get to emotional about unless they don not work and one of myelectonic gizmoes get fried
this one seems to work
and i am happy .
purchased these three years ago and could not be happier
three years running and this is the only power strip you will find in my house
my condo is a man cave electronic paradise and have had zero issues to date
i purchased this item at $17 dollars each and if i recall correctly i ordered six of them
must buy for expensive electronics !
it is going to be a year since i bought this monster protector and i am not disappointed
i have connected a 32" lcd sony bravia , a mini home theater bought in amazon ( theater solution ) and a pioneer bought here too , plus an old toshiba dvd recorder to record my cable tv shows
all systems have resisted spikes , brownouts and low voltage due electrical problems here in my area ( strong wind hitting cables )
the design is sleek comparing with others i have seen before
the coaxial cables of cable tv are connected through this baby and there is zero bad signal or interference
the price is very affordable for this great protector .
this is my second one and i love these
this product is worth the price and it works great
it you spent a ton on money on electronics , this is the best way to protect them from surges
we would recommend .
great value
i have had no issues with the product
unfortunately , this is one of this items that you find out about how good it is when things go wrong
hopefully it is never put to the test .
kind of pricy but i have forgotten it exists which is exactly what it is supposed to do
it survived multiple power outages and the color coded plugs are nice
other than that it exists behind the table in a shivering world of dust bunnies and small toy parts that my kids have lost
it would be nice if they developed technology for the surge protector to self repair using the bunnies and small toy soldiers but until then i guess it does it exactly what it says .
i have one of these i bought years ago and it is still going strong
i needed another surge protector to use with my ps4 and xbox one and assorted cable boxes and router
hooked everything up and have not given it another thought
just what you want out of one of these
got it at a fantastic price so i am happy with my purchase .
great unit for the price
able to house up to eight devices
had mine for several months and several thunder/lighting storms
still going strong .
nice product ! although the printed label doesnt coincide with what i plugged in , it is still a very nice product and seemed to protect all my gadgets
thanks !
this is the most overpriced item , i own several monster power items , and their higher end units are great but this thing is worthless , you might as well get a no name brand
i had this thing one my 3rd tv and it fried out within <NUM> weeks , and none of the others did .
great product
works well
if you over amp this product , it will shut off but will probably never work again
i have two surge protectors that got overloaded and never worked again
monster has a great warranty & replacement , but they are a bit difficult to get to customer service or help
make sure you know your jules and amps for what you are using it for
otherwise , it works great and has decent spacing for <NUM> larger outlets .
jury is still out , shortly after i connected my tv to it , and used the coaxial input/output to protect my tv from lightning or whatever , i now can not receive hd signal from some channels like 5
1 and above
analog version of the same channel comes in fine but when i tried to change it to the digital ( from channel <NUM> to channel 5
1 ) i get a blank screen with a "weak signal" message
i will try to bypass the surge protector and try it direct from wall , just annoying
does exactly what i purchased it for
powerrs several devices from one plug
the monster name is well known and trusted , so the slight extra expense was worth it .
bought a few of these based on the rating and features
we get small surges fairly often
had three of these units fail within a year
get a surge , the powercenter trips and blows the main breaker on that circuit
shake the powercenter and you can hear little electronic bits rattling around inside
dead and not repairable
have a dozen or more surge protectors ( different brands ) which are all just fine
monster are the only brand that regularly blow out
they should survive at least several small surges without actually exploding inside
colorful but useless .
i bought this as a precaution for my home office area where i have my home networking devices and laptop set up
surge protectors are tricky to review because you never really know if it really works until you have a power surge but i can provide you a few things to keep in mind :
protection : rated at about <NUM> joules
for those of you who aren not particularly computer saavy ( i admit i had to do some research on this ) the higher it is rated , the more it can take before it fails to protect
for <NUM> bucks , <NUM> joules of protection is a steal
will it protect your belongings from a lightning strike on your ungrounded home ? probably not
will it protect and prolong your devices from spikes and surges ? absolutely
features & functions : 8ft chord makes it adaptable and easy to locate an outlet for it
ground indicator light makes me feel safe and secure ( i live in an older home while going to school and wiring is suspect )
protection light and auditory warning system nice touches to tell you if the unit needs replacing
color coded outlets and included tags make it easy to identify wires
coaxial a nice feature usually reserved for more expensive protectors and i haven not noticed any internet speed decreases from using it
price : mentioned before , but if you can get this unit for <NUM> bucks as i have , look no further
extra goodies : includes a monster coaxial cable ( if you are one of those people that has to have top of the line cables )
: purple and multicolored
this is purely a matter of opinion , but i prefer my other apc protector is matte black finish
that being said , it is a surge protector , not a fashion statement
warranty : do not be fooled by thinking just by purchasing you suddenly do not need homeowner is insurance
monster is a business and as such will try to find a way to screw you if they can
nothing against monster , but a business is a business
they will not honor their warranty claims without making you jump through some hoops first
read some other reviews on here for horror stories
that being said , this is the truth with most companies in this business
conclusion : monster hasn not developed a sterling rep for nothing
this is an awesome protector at a great price
in my opinion , they are second only to apc is protectors
but when you factor in the price compared to the protection , you really can not go wrong with this protector
i know i haven not .
one of the best surge protectors i ever bought
i labeled , it comes with labels , and monster is a brand you could trust .
i had my hdtv and dvd and some other electronics connected to an older surge protector that was still fully protecting my equipment but felt that it was time to move up with the hdtv involved
i like the design it allows for those transformer plugs that take up so much space
the color code is nice and i used as applied but i don not have all the things labeled , that is okay used them for other items
it has enough coverage for my items and if there should be a loss i would get enough money to get new items
i feel better protected over my 15yr old surge protector that i have no idea where the proof of purchase is anymore and i know it probably will not cover an hdtv
i plan to get another to replace a second older version
the hardest thing about this is not set up it is getting the clam shell case cut off
: )
this monster power strip is supposed to suppress line voltage noise which in theory should give you better sound and picture and peace of mind should your power go out and snap back on ( spike )
crutchfield is actually did a measurement with and without this power strip and the results where astounding !
the only negative to monster brand is the reality quality costs more than riskier inferior competitors
yes , you might be able to get others for less to work almost as well but you will sleep better when you trust the monster label .
i had three extension cords piggybacked into two wall outlets
that is not good , so i ordered this thinking it probably wouldn not be worth the money
but it was ! this was a very heavy duty item as well as a strip cord
i was able to systematically remove the electrical nightmare
and now i also have one free outlet on that wall socket
i am impressed
so much so i will be buying another .
there is not a whole lot you can say about this item , it does what it says and there aren not any surprises
while i usually like to save my five star ratings for things i really love , i just don not know what they could have done any different with this
so , it gets my coveted five star rating
price is pretty good too
i will buy more if they are still around .
it is okay for what i am using it for , probably would be great for most others
i purchased it to handle those ( transformer/plug ) devices that i have connected to my computer
i have two other similar types of strips and this one is probably the best of the bunch ( as being advertised as &<HASHTAG> ; made for transformer/plugs&<HASHTAG> ; )
the problem is that there are many different size , shape and angle of the plugs
and depending on what you have you seldom can make use of all the outlets , there is just not enough space between outlets .
so far i haven not had the need for a higher price one
we don not have a lot of fancy equipment
i felt no need ( and i was correct ) to purchase a $500 surge protector that c
city recommended .
ok , first off , this unit works well ( though it does not have phone line surge protection , as others have noted )
it is a larger unit , and doesn not 'hide' well , but it does have the cable protector , so if you are looking for cable protection , this may be for you
that said , keep in mind , everyone is rating this unit stars , and few have actually had a notest situation' where you can actually address how it truly performs
it is like having a set of car tires that have never had a flat , because you have never been or in rough areas , and yet you rate them as ' on the trail'
how would you know ? this surge bar is rated to <NUM> joules
what does this mean ? well , it means that it can provide up to <NUM> joules of power before it 'pops' , or protects your electronics
that is equivalent to <NUM> , or on ac , about 13
5 amps of current
what does this mean to you , the user ? well , it means that it will 'break' the circuit if more power than are sent through the line ( normally , because of a storm , or a into your local utility poles , etc
) what it will not do , is protect your electronics from mildly varying voltage swings
those that may even be deadly to your electonics
why ? because most power spikes come in the form of voltage swings above
for desktops and monitors , is the executioner is axe for them
and if you only have drawn through your surge bar , a swing from ac to ac is not enough to trip the protection features of the surge bar
keep in mind , until you demand more than at , ( or more than a sum of <NUM> watts are used or supplied ) , this bar will not stop it
bottom line
surge bars are great for lightning protection
but if you think you have varying electrical voltage that is causing electronics damage on your system , get a voltage meter and check your provider is supply throughout the day for a few days
if it goes over at any time , notify them of this , and start looking for a regulated power supply or voltage regulator
these surge bars are not voltage regulators .
the color coding is a nice touch on the plugs
makes for a tidy arrangement for the numerous power cords .
product is splendid value for the money , although i will admit i bought the name for i have known and trusted monster products for many years
the product will handle only coax , and has excellent response time and joules rating
sadly , i purchased it for my mother after the lightning hit the tree across the street .
i have never understood surge protection
this one delivers fantastic surge protection , but so what ? lots will
this one is wow ! when properly engaged it delivers onto your hd screen thickening colors , smoothing audio , almost erasing
you will wonder if you have still got the same hdtv
it is that good !
this surge protector does what it is supposed to do
it is designed for tv/home theater use and has the proper outlets for that purpose
i detect no interference using the cable protection
i have used monster surge protectors for all my electronic needs , and the reasonble price at amazon makes that easier to do .
i bought this to protect my marantz home theater , playstation 3 , and samsung flatscreen
outlets are well spaced and this device protects my incoming cable service also
so , if i suffer a lightning strike , will it work ? stay tuned .
i use this for my home tv entertainment
it works well , and protect your asset
i refer people to buy it .
amazon had a good price on this monster surge protector , my old surge protectors were worn out
i plan to order more of these surge protectors if they are still available .
the item arrived in packaging looking like it had been opened prior and had been returned
plugged it in and got a constant hum and the reset button didn not work
no power to the unit at all
the seller accepted the item as a return , no problem
i didn not have to pay for the return shipping and my entire order , including original shipping charge , was refunded , so i was pleased with that , at least
i have learned that buying electronics over the internet can sometimes be tricky , but with amazon i have never had a problem with any return .
i have three of these now and they work great for my home theaters
3m command strips work well to mount it on a wall too .
this worked for a couple of weeks
now when i plug it into the wall it makes a loud buzzing sound
now i have to deal with their warranty department
i will update this review with that experience .
like the spacing for adapters and the extra long cord as typical w/monster adapters
like the spacing for adapters and the extra long cord as typical w/monster adapters .
when i first hooked up my new hdtv and dvr , i couldn not get a signal to the dvr
when the cable guy came out , he said the problem was a weak signal
after working on my cable for <NUM> minutes , it turns out that the "surge protection" of the cable coax on this unit loses too much of the signal
don not use it
otherwise , this product is fine
but i could have bought a cheaper one that didn not have these "extra" features .
this is a good enough surge protector
given how much monster knows about multi media setups , i wish they had spaced out the sockets a bit more
i seem to have a lot of fat headed plugs ( adapters for hand drives , cable modem etc ) that really crowd out the sockets
there is a lot of real estate on the unit , so i dont know why monster did not space the sockets out .
great product , purchased this for a friend and they love it
i would not buy it as it is unnecessary to purchase this expensive of a surge protector .
i already had three of these units
when i saw this as a black friday deal i couldn not pass it up
it is not the latest model , but it offers superior protection for my electronics and has plenty of outlets for all sizes of plugs
highly recommend .
typical surge protector
has plenty of room between plugs and works just as described
not the best looking but mine is hidden
just bought a new sony hdtv and these surge protectors make everything including the tv safe .
lot of good reviews , but not a reliable piece of h/w
i bought it because of 5* review , but i dont trust all those reviews , as i am completely dissatisfied with this product
on/off switch came off after just <NUM> months of use
not too much time in surge protector life span
thank god , i did not really faced any power surge , i cant imagine such low quality product saving any of my electronic device
and if you have already don not similar mistake of buying this product , then don not touch on/off switch , and pray that it performs when time comes .
this product safely protects your electronic products while offering multiple plug in options
it comes with a quality coax cable too .
this company makes probably the best surge suppressors there are
they are not cheap and perform as advertised
bought two to protect some of my touchier electronics .
it is exactly what i needed and it looks good doing it is job
it is a great buy and well priced
i plan to buy another one as a spare
used to sell these at best buy for $79
you do the math , a great protection for your equipment
gave this to my daughter for stereo and tv .
i purchased this surge protector for a 40" lcd tv
the price is reasonable with free shipping from amazon
no excessive effort required with the plugs
unit has surge protection for the cable line .
i find this to be a very well built power center
of course , the proof would be in whether it can really protect when that big surge hits
i hope i never have to find out
we do get a bit of static on our hd tv on occasion by running the cables through the protector
but that might be from the cables and not the protector .
[since the following was written , the price difference between the monster and belkin ( both approx
25 ) has become decisively gaping ( 20 and 35 ) , making the belkin the only sane choice
}monster is premium quality at a premium price
musicians will pay more for a monster patch cord than some folks would pay for an electric piano
but on closer inspection , this power strip is competitively priced
i recently purchased a belkin strip at only several dollars below this monster strip
but the belkin would accommodate only <NUM> of my plugs because <NUM> of the receptacles are in a vertical row ( with the ground holes on the inside , not the outside as is the case with monster )
consequently , a plug took up the space of <NUM> receptacles , in effect reducing me to the same number outlets as this monster
even so , why not save several bucks and get the belkin ? two compelling reasons in favor of the monster ( the included hdmi cable isn not one of them ) : 1
the color coding is a thoughtful timesaver/frustration eliminator ( how many times have you found yourself on the floor suddenly at a loss about which device connects to which receptacle ? ) 2
the surface tells you at a glance whether the unit is connected and receiving power ( belkin units have too few or zero lights , requiring the user to get down on all 4 is to determine whether the problem is a loss of power to the strip )
i am giving it <NUM> instead of <NUM> stars because only <NUM> of the <NUM> outlets are dedicated to those power adapters ( )
count on the remaining <NUM> outlets accommodating no more than <NUM> additional power adapters .
monster has awesome products and this is no exception
i use them on just about every outlet connected to equiptment like the laptop , phone charger , etc
awesome price should have purchased more
works great
looks and feels solid heavy
i use it for my home tv and audio
will have to see how it holds up during power surge
highly recommend .
the labels are specially designed for an entertainment system
i like the size of this unit
the coaxial cable that comes with it us of good quality
i got it for a great price which makes it easier to overlook any flaws
if you are very organized and want to designate where each plug goes , this is perfect .
and the labeling of what you plug in , the eight receptacles have been helpful to get the cable , internet , tv , & sound systemall plugged in .
ordered this from amazon because it was the best price
it is color coded and labeled so you know where your tv , stereo , etc
is plugged in if you choose to use these
it also has surge suppression for your cable/satellite connections
the actual plug and cord that goes to the wall is very long
i am very happy with this product and think it is a good deal .
nicely coded for easy installation , enough room for transformers , the color codes are just great for any beginner or novice to connect
good quality , using for my computer so the labels don not work for me
much cheaper than local stores
works good
have used a similar one for my home theater , no problems
wish i paid this price for my last one .
good quality product
good spacing for plugs and connections are secure and protect your electronics
this model is the older version but works great .
they say that if design is good , it should be <PERCENT> invisible
i bought this years ago and have barely thought about it sense
reliable , functions well , good purchase .
this is what i needed
so many cables in the back of my entertainment center , this organizes them via color
tabs for the power cords so you can easily rematch anything you may have to unplug at a later date .
people who think designed this
practical thinkers
i see a well thought out , well carried out product being sold at a reasonable price
however , the manufacturers description has one flaw
this does not have phone line protection
everything else is as described
yes i recommend and i would again buy , and just might for other areas of the house and shop .
i bought this power center for three reasons
the durability of the unit
the length of the cord
the price
i am not disappointed in any way
the unit is very sturdy
it can easily be stepped on or kicked without suffering any kind of damage
i needed an extra long cord and this unit has it
the cord is durable and more than long enough for most uses
the price on this power strip was great
you will not find a price anywhere near this good for a comparable unit in any brick and mortar retailer
i would certainly buy another of these units if i needed it
highly recommended .
i understand they came out with a replacement model which was selling for twice the price
i am glad i found this one for its phase out price because i needed two of them
i installed them both and ran the cable tv wire through the provision for that
everything works perfectly .
this surge protector seems to have everything i need--plus useful ( with matching cable labels )
my neighborhood had power outages often , sometimes several times in one week
until the power company figures out how to stop these chronic outages and surges , i need to protect my electronics and appliances
tivo recommended i use a surge protector with cable connection to protect my tv , tivo , and dvd players from surges that can occur directly through the cable connection , not just through power outlets
it was easy to connect the incoming cable line to the monster unit , then the outgoing cable to the tivo box ( or your cable tv tuner box )
( i don not know if there is a different product for satellite tv systems
) this surge protector has <NUM> outlets , <NUM> of which are oversized for larger plugs , plus the cable ports ( in/out )
i didn not think i'd like the colorful surge protector ( i'd prefer other colors ) , but the turned out to be quite useful with all my home theater devices' cords
there are labels that correspond with the outlet colors so you can wrap the appropriate label around the specific cord for fast
very happy !
i bought this surge protector following a storm that seemed to mess up my last protector
the monster cable protector works just fine and hase plenty of room for all of my pc and office plugs
the extra wide sockets come in very handy too .
there are still some really good buys out there that also bear quality
and this is one of them
we are very happy with this product ! it seems to be made top quality !
thought this would be enough for the entertainment system
it is working as expected now
easy to connect and use
i found the labels helpful against each power outlet .
this is a must buy for your valuable purchase
in my place i have seen that the electricity fluctuates a lot
this provides protection to valuable equipment .
this surge protector accommodates the large plugs , and its nice to have the color identification and the long cord with the protection .
i have used monster power equipment for a while and have not been disappointed in the past
the same is true for this power supply .
i recently bought a new plasma tv and some home audio gear and wanted to protect my investment
this fits the bill perfectly and is reasonably priced
so far its seems to do the job , one lightning storm and no fried electronics !
as with most monster products they are superior to the cheaper store bought power strips
highly recommend .
it is a good power strip
but it should be around $15
i like its look and feature anyway
monster makes good products .
i give this only a <NUM> star rating because i have only started using this and i don not know over all how this will perform over time
so far it is lasted about <NUM> days since i unpacked it
i would have given it a <NUM> star if i had it in use longer .
this powercenter is a good , solid device
it will give you plenty of connections for your home theatre devices
the only drawback in my opinion is that it has a high profile which leaves the cables high off the floor ( inches before you can bend the cable )
it is not really much higher than average surge suppressors but enough so that i could not tuck it under my entertainment center or mount it on the wall behind without leaving a big gap behind it
i have no doubts about its protective claims
the monster brand is very reliable and indicates decent quality
i have been buying their cables for years- both for home theatre applications and audio gear
if i had to choose again , though , i would try to find something with a lower/more compact profile .
legendary quality at a very low price
i personally don not care if it is last years model or even discontinued , it just works very well at a great cost .
i could plug an air conditioner into this thing ! word word word wordword word word word word word word word word word .
exactly what i needed
the large plug ins definitely helped with space issues for my other things on my entertainment center and can now hide this strip behind my components .
i like this product , i have a few power strips for my entertainment and computer needs and i like this item
i have been plagued with very dirty power for years
after doing a great deal of research , as i would suggest anyone do before buying almost anything , i settled on the monster mp ht800
i am using it mainly for audio recording , voice over work to be exact , where a clean signal is a must
hooked up my computer , mixing board and amp to this , and right away , the low frequency hum , i have had to pad out , went away
bought two now , and in the crowded urban environment of la , i finally have clean sounding power
this is no hype , just the facts
i know some reviewers don not notice a difference , well they probably have less noise to filter out
hope the surge protection is as good as the filtering
price was right on amazon as well
i think i will get a third for the home theater .
this fits the bill nicely at <NUM> bucks while you could spend 200+ with the same company really getting the same item
if you have a basic home theater set up this will do just fine
i have no reservations with mine
i haven not had any problems , but i will update if i do
nothing fancy ; just a power cleaner that works as advertised so far .
works like every other power strip i have got from them only one has had a problem that is one of the green product versions
its great , cheap and has good spacing for the plugs
this has been one of , my best investments
monster is the right name for this power center , it protects all of your most valued electronics
don not let it go by without buying one
you will thank me , for this review
but i know you work hard to earn your pay check , the last thing you would like to have to happen , is for your equipment to get damaged
because you used a cheap , or no surge protector .
ok , i just installed a new lcd tv in my bedroom , mounted it to the wall , bought a power kit to have the plug in the closet be accessible and now needed a surge protector
this was a cheap price for a high quality product
first , you have a simple way to lable all your plugs
one of the biggest problems is taking plugs out
this has the plugs color coded and the cord gets a label to color coordinate it
also the plus work well
i have not had a chance to test a surge , but i noticed a better picture and sound on my tv
i think it is clean power worked
the other one ( i bought two ) is installed , but tv works as good as before
it was a great product and price
would recommend it to put all your high tech products in a safe powerstrip
small investment vs a destroyed home theatre equipment
( explain why you did not do it to your wife after it is destroyed ? - get this now
you will not be sorry ! )
i have no horror stories about lightning strikes or major power surges to tell
this does the job that i need , but do not think it has been truly tested
i have <NUM> of these for various setups
there was a tv that would occasionaly just have sound no picture
replacing the surge protector with the monster model seems to have elimated the problem
when they are reasonably priced ( as opposed to most monster pricing ) i believe they are a good deal
i hope i never have to find out how good they really are or take advantage of the monster protection plan .
great price on amazon , meets my needs perfectly
have hdtv , cable box , receiver , subwoofer , , and antenna plugged in without any space issues
flat outlet plug is a plus
i am so happy i bought this
i bought it so i can use it for my fish tank and it is just right
i would buy it again .
i noticed a slight difference in picture quality - somehow this must be helping with electricity fluctuations in my home
i connected this to another surge suppressor that is plugged into my wall
as this monster unit also provides me with filtered electricity , i would rather sacrifice another surge suppressor instead of the monster unit .
i spent a little more than the bare minimum on this , and i am glad
it is helpful to have the labels and color codes
and after two hurricanes hitting this region in recent years , i am glad to have a unit with some heft and recognized brand standing behind the warranty .
these were on sale and obviously they are top notch
i bought three of them for my office , and they are excellent surge protectors and power strips
i definitely would gladly recommend these .
b/c monster pricing ( discounting ) has come down quite a bit over the years , i usually buy monster surge protectors/filters for all of my televisions
so far so good , although i haven not had one actually have to be used during a surge scenario
i like the flat plug , on/off/protected/ground indicators , colored/spaced outlets , and even included coax cable .
we used this on a piece of medical equipment that was not functioning properly due to a noisy power source
it filtered the niose , fixing the problem .
i use this on my main ht setup , and haven not had any issues through numerous blackouts
i bought a new tv on black friday , and decided to replace the dusty old surge protector i was using
sprung for this again @ $20 , and i can not complain
i am not an expert on av stuff , but i usually buy monster solutions because they appear to be tried and true .
i just ordered my third monster mp ht800 home theater power center , and would recommend this unit to anyone ! i have <NUM> big screen tv is , a samsung 46" , a toshiba 40" , and a lg 55"
i purchased my first monster unit about three years ago , where i live we have frequent power surges and some power outages , this surge protector ( monster mp ht800 ) has saved me a fortune in repair and or replacement costs ! doe is it work , yes ! they are well worth the purchase , at one time you would have to pay about $90
00 for one , and now you can get them for $30
00 or less , a great deal for trmendious protection !
i have purchased a couple of these for a couple of home theaters and haven not had a problem yet
i am not sure about the claim process noted by the other reviewer , but so far they seem to work fine
( probably because my house hasn not experienced a major power surge yet ) do not buy this at best buy as they charge retail prices
it is much cheaper on amazon
the systems i have purchased these for have not been high end setups
if you are considering this for a dollar home theatre/audio setup , i would highly suggest that you buy something nicer
why not spend the dollars ( if you insist on monster
<URL> ) that will protect the thousands you spent on your ht ?
although the product is great and the protection indicator gives you a sense of security , the looks could improve
easy to install , and easy to mount on walls in a vertical position .
i did my research , and this model power surge protector had exactly the features i wanted , and none of the extras i would never use
do your research , figure out what you are plugging into a surge protector , and then buy the one that suits your needs
i saved about $40 buying this item online here at amazon
the surge protector was brand new in the packaging and has worked great ! no problems .
i have never been one to keep up with the jones so when this price was offered i snagged two of these
always have power outages in tucson and if i forget to turn off coffee pot during one i lose my coffee maker when power comes back on
that had me concerned about computer and tv set up
have not had power out since getting these but it was wonderful to solve the problem of which cord was plugged in where .
haven not had any power surges to try it out but it does what it does , allows me to hook up my entire home theater system to one outlet .
monster cable now makes a line of quality power strips that both protect your electronic components from dangerous power surges but also provide line filtering to enhance your audio/visual experience
mp ht800 is the one i chose from this line
i like the many features of this surge protector , such as the outlets that make it a breeze to recognize the purpose of individual outlets
the outlets come pre- labeled for your components , and matching cord labels are provided for easy and logical hookup
i like the fact that the monster cable ht800 comes with a <NUM> ft
long ac power cable
so many surge protectors use only <NUM> foot or shorter power cables
so , this provides ample length for most
another great feature of the power cable is that it has a flat profile plug that is set at a right angle to provide greater flexibility for installations and allows furniture to hug the walls
the power surge protector itself has <NUM> outlets total , including <NUM> which are spaced for use with ac adapter transformers
try to match that with generic power surge protectors ! another quality feature is that all the contacts are 24k gold to allow maximum conductivity
there is a lot to like in this home theater power surge protector and not much if anything to dislike
i would recommend this to anyone wanting a better quality surge protector for their a/v system
i hope this helps .
i bought this when i upgraded to a hdtv and surround sound
i have been using it over a year now without any problems
every socket is being used without any glitches
if you need a lot of sockets and a reliable , well made power strip , this is the one to buy
it is pretty cheap as well making it a great deal !
i truly was not a believer in monster cable power protection prior to my problem of last week even though i own four of them , all ht800 is , but now i have no doubt the monster power protection unit ( ht800 ) saved my complete system and definitely my paradigm sub 15
even though i am an old guy who enjoyed the 70 is , i still like my music and movies ( dts hd ma ) loud but clean
last week i was playing adel ( blu albert hall ) pleasingly loud and the internal speaker wire connector ( one of four ) on my paradigm sub <NUM> vibrated off
the monster ht800 immediately detected a fault and shut off the power to my system
i know this definitely saved my $3 , 500 sub and i wonder had the power not been interrupted i feel that in addition to the sub i would have lost my denon receiver and possibly all the other speakers in my system too ! the monster ht800 maintained a warning squeal alerting me to a problem and unfortunately all i could save was the high quality extension cord as the ht800 was dead
small price to pay for the cost savings from that monster unit
thanks monster ! i have already relplaced the dead monster ht800 with a monster hts1000mk111
now i definately am a believer in monster cable power and thank you , thank you , thank you
"monster cable" ! peter mcnicholsault ste marie , ontario
a fine quality product from monster
nice to have the different options and the price was perfect
great for all entertainment systems .
colorfully labeled , this surge protector like power strip is very easy to use to coordinate all your electronic devices
it takes the guesswork out of which plug goes to what device .
i love my monster cable ! since i could not find a &<HASHTAG> ; computer&<HASHTAG> ; monster cable i bought the home theater one which seems to be running happily on my computer
i like a certain amount of protection for my computer , and i chose this
i realize it won not protect against a lightening bolt , but it does smooth out the jagged power we receive every day , to a great extent
smooth power for your computer is important , computers like running on smooth power ! well , this was my choice to protect my computer ( and monitor , printer , etc ) as best as i could , and i am very happy with it
i bought one for my husband also .
it is a power strip , not really a lot to say
i got two of these for a very low price
monster products are pretty pricy , however if you get them on sale they are well made , attractive looking , and have been reliable so far for me
i have several surge protector/power strips from monster ( all purchased at steep discounts from list ) as well as some cables
they all work fine , and the ergonomics are very good .
while this is a very good product , iot like all monster products is about <PERCENT> over priced
thee are cheaper solutions with a lower price tag
received quickly .
someone once told me that something is working well if you never notice it is there
that is the case with this monster
it just keeps doing its job without notice
it looks nice and sturdy for the price
in addition to electrical protection it has provisions for cable and telephone protection
and it is a monster who have a good overall reputation .
checked out monster products and found they had a good reputation for quality and they stand behind their powercenter with an impressive warranty to pay for my electronics if their surge protector fails
i specifically needed the cable protection as well as power protection
lightning can run in on the cable and fry a flat screen as easily as surging through the power supply
i was looking at the latest offerings and scrolled down on amazon to find this product
does everything i need for a greatly reduced price
what is not to like about that ?
i recently purchased this product because i noticed that the electrical spikes in our building have been occuring more frequently and all our entertainment devices ( 120hz led tv , cable box , modem , router , audio receiver , ps3 , wii , vhs , etc
) that are hooked up to the same power source have been affected causing the units to spontaneously shut down or manifest some sort of interference
considering the collective value of all the devices in our "entertainment set , " i realized that we needed something ( a surge protector ) that provided more than just surge protection - something that would allow us to fully benefit from the features of the devices
i have been using this product for more than a week now and noticed that the picture quality on our led tv improved - it is more vibrant and the unit doesn not shut down spontaneously
the sound quality from our receiver and subwoofer has also improved - the fading effect disappeared
i also hooked up the tv cable ( coaxial ) into this surge protector and noticed that it stopped shutting down
the picture quality on the hd channels also improved
furthermore , i really appreciated the cable of the unit
the bonus items ( coaxial and phone cables ) came in handy because i also hooked up the tv cable and the phone/fax line to it
some of the the labels on the device could use a little modification
nonetheless , i consider this product a bargain ( $22 for a $120 value ! )
i would recommend this product to anyone who has an entertainment system and values it
it doesn not make sense to spend so much money on an entertainment set when you are not going to gain the full experience
this product will allow you to do just that .
this is a great looking item , with great markings for each component
the only down side for me is it only has <NUM> outlets and i need 10 .
well i decided to write a review on this product since i just had it blow and start squealing
i am rating it at four stars due to the fact i have to buy a new one
i have owned and used monster power surge protectors for years
i have an older model hts mkii <NUM> that has functioned flawlessly for the past <NUM> years or so in texas and ohio now
my home has had multiple power issues with storms etc in both states and never had a problem with it
i also purchased the hts <NUM> last year with a 60" plasma screen i bought and wanted to make sure i had it protected
attached to the hts800 were a number of devices : 60" plasma screen , onkyo av receiver , ps3 , hd cable box , cd player , ipod dock and dvd/dvr unit
well last evening as i was watching hd television through the receiver i hear a audible click followed by a loader click almost immediately and all power in the wall unit went out and everything turned off
i immediately heard a low squealing noise that i had never heard before
i followed the sound to find it was coming from the monster power center hts800
i immediately thought thankful that it turned everything off and found that i could not get it to reset the fuse or stop the squealing sound
i then went on line and found a post that the another customer had the same thing happen and that it "fried" the unit and it would need to be replaced but it protected as intended
well after plugging in my hts mkii <NUM> from my downstairs home theater system , i found that my onkyo av receiver ( ) would not come back on
this unit has been giving me problems for a while with consistently reading a multitude of different blue ray players and ran very warm
could double as a space heater
looks like the receiver blew and from a reverse direction blew the receiver or the was a power surge that made it through ( doubtful )
i just got off the phone with monster warranty department and they were very friendly and courteous with me
they will send out a claim package and will immediately send a replacement power center
i am a fan of good customer service and monster has been a <NUM> star service so far
i have a few understandable hoops to jump through i
fill out a claims package , get an estimate of repair for the receiver , etc but they could be sending me a check for repair/replacement costs
now , i am not patient so i have already ordered a new av receiver ( pioneer due to cnet review/amazon ratings ) here on amazon and yes i also bought another monster power center hts800
i believe it did its job , even though i can not reset it which is the only reason it is receiving <NUM> stars here
i went with the same unit because of the sale price that i just could not pass up
i would love to have bought the hts mkiii <NUM> which also had a great sale price , but it was almost $50 more and the <NUM> functioned as it was intended to protect the other valuable items in my home theater
pros : sale price , customer service , lifetime replacement warranty on power center , spacing of outlets , audible alarm and status lightscons : could not reset the unit
this was my most expensive surge protector
i bought it to protect my brand new 63" plasma
for a while it worked fine , but then it started to short out and got to the point where the cable box turned off
not wanting to risk damaging my tv , i moved it for use with a simple lamp and phone
a couple weeks later it started whistling and then turned off completely
i never had a surge protector do that before and cringe at the thought of the damage it could have done to my plasma
stay away from this company .
i give this product a <NUM> because it is probably to expensive but it does hat its supposed to do
i bought it when i purchased a news <NUM> inch tv and a bose surround system and i wanted to make sure that my new stuff was safe
this product does give me piece of mind
it also looks cool and the lable really do come in handy .
i am using the monster cable mp home theater powercenter hts800 to remove line noise in the electrical current to a tube
the line noise is removed beautifully ; however , the powercenter itself creates a tone
the tone comes out of the powercenter device directly
if you are planning to use this product on a sound system , i recommend placing it in a location that is acoustically isolated .
can not use the item since it does not work with 220v power outlet ( europe standard power ) and there is no any information about this incompatibility
i have bought it to power all my devices with us power plug using one connector , but when i switch that device on i just have a power outage in the room
now i am not sure if it is still working at all .
at least somebody is catering to this market
there are so many products out there ( cables , power , etc
) that are so obviously designed to make money by giving you the cheapest possible components
i purchase my monster products with delight because at least they appear to care about quality
i have never actually compared this power strip to another by watching the same video feed and cannot say for sure that it does what it says with regard to filtering ac pollution
but , i do know that ac pollution exists and sometimes my mobile video equipment will pick up radio signals and corrupt microphone recordings
this power strip does completely eliminate rf ( radio frequency ) interference , and that alone made it worth the purchase for me .
no problems to report
sockets are easy to get to , and coaxial connection was a breeze
you spikes or shield problems to report
cable cutter is happy .
needed a couple of decent power strips for two television areas preferably under twenty bucks
got it ! no complaints
also comes with accessory cord labels and quality phone cord if needed .
monster cables , indeed ! these power center surge protector is so good that this is the second time i order <NUM> new ones
i have been so impressed with these power centers , that i had to buy a few more to protect my theater center , computers and other items of true value
which i must say , cost me lots of hard earned money
i highly recommend these items to anyone who has an investment in their , toys of entertainment
it is better to be safe than sorry !
the &quot ; monster clean power circuitry ( model hts800 ) has it all for your audio / video components
including sound &amp ; picture
simple to use monster provides you with color coded outlets with mathching tags to apply to the appropiate plugs
( this is very important in those times of removing the correct plug without disturbing the existing system setup )
these are the perks of the hts800 : * the power cord is <NUM> foot in length and has a <NUM> prong plug with a <NUM> degree offset to allow use of adjacent wall outlets
( a very convenient and wonderful feature )
* <NUM> outlets to cover all your needs , <NUM> color coded ones to include ; vcr , dvd , cable , cd , &amp ; audio amp
<NUM> additional widely spaced outlets for tv and <NUM> spares
* video cable antenna ( coaxiale ) / dss or divx surge protection filter circuit ( improves cable picture by up to <PERCENT> )
* phone line surge protection filter
* a free <NUM> foot monster video and telephone cable
*visual and audio surge alarm
this clean power system is a must for that family room with all the gadgets ! your investment needs to be protected and this is the all in one product that can do it for you
i love mine .
it looks nice and is easy to install
but that is all
after a recent storm i had $5000
00 worth of home theater equipment rendered inoperable
the result of my contact with monster ? one generic email the nothing , zip , nada
save your money .
good quality low price power center with noise filter
this power center has good outlet spacing allowing for transformers to fit without covering outlets as some power centers have not incorporated this design causing loss of total number of available outlets .
works well as this is the 2nd one i purchased
like all monster products they tend to be overpriced , however with exceptional quality
i prefer monster over any other cable brand
how can i get excited about reviewing this product ? i use it only as a power strip , since i have a directv/tivo and a phillips lcd tv connected via component video
i understood what i was buying though , so i won not ding monster for the item
it does its job and it does it well , but there are no bells and whistles on this thing .
the house i live in was built in 1939 ; they didn not have tvs back in 1939 ; the outlets aren not even three prong grounded except for one the landlord had to have put in with a higher capacity circuit to accomodate that new fangled gadget--the air conditioner
so when i picked up my new sharp aquos , 1080p , 42" television i was very susceptible to the pitch that i should buy only the most expensive surge protector / line noise reducer possible , the more expensive the better--but i am not a sucker so i didn not buy it right there and then
next store , best buy , the salesperson recommends the hts800 as the minimum , and he recommends more expensive ones but not with as much zeal
the difference is that the best buy salesperson doesn not work for commission
the logic is of course that if you are going to spend $1500 for a tv , you might as well spend another $100 or so to protect it from electrical surges and clean up the picture static caused by line noise in both our ancient power supply and by our cable provider
i find this on amazon for no less than a <NUM> percent discount over what i can find it for anywhere else , and order it , but before i open the package i go to the monster website to make absolutely sure this one is adaquate--and it is
the difference between this and higher end ones is the capacity and the ability for the unit to not only shut off and sound an alarm when there is a surge , but also turn everything back on safely
this one will turn off everything that is hooked into it and sound an alarm , besides cleaning up the line noise , but that is as far as the description goes
ok , so i open the package and hook it up
absolutely huge difference in the picture on the set
i don not think a more expensive one would make a great difference or that it would be worth it for me--on my level of home entertainment--to pay more for a 'better' one
and then , one day soon after , i hear an alarm warning me about a dangerous surge , but it doesn not shut down the system
perhaps just to assure me , another day it does shut down the cable box only and then came back on
but the real prize is the picture
there is a huge difference between the quality of the picture on my hd television with this filtering the power and cable lines
i am thinking of buying another one for my old tv--a sony trinitron--because i am sure it must make a difference there as well
bottom line : if you live in a fairly new building , your electrical system is probably not as much of a hazard as mine , but might be just as noisy
and surges are always a big risk , even if you have all new appliances
for what you spend on items like televisions , stereos , and game systems , it is worth paying a bit more to protect them from the kind of damage that insurance wont cover--wear and tear--as well as allow them to perform as intended--better than they do while on display at your local electronics store in fact
this item will not only protect your sensitive electronics , but make them better as well
clearer images , clearer sound , and it is just plain smart design
now that i have this one , i definitely would pay for the next level up from this model but i am also confident that this is all i need
a higher level one has more features , but for my home entertainment purposes i doubt it would really add anything
if one day i really go all out in terms of buying a full home theatre system , i will spend a couple of hundred dollars on the best one , but this one was made for people like me now who don not have such high end needs but want performance .
great bang for the buck if your looking for an inexpensive but good quality surge protector , also if you have an hdtv you need a special type of protector like this one , because the tv is are much more susceptible to power surges , and this monster cable powercenter is meant for hdtv is and other sensitive electronics .
1st of all i did not get the one in the picture
looks like they are sending the new edition ! 2nd it is great !
super slim , it will fit under anything , the colored coded outlets are a plus in case you have several equipment connected ( like me )
3rd it really works
last week there was an electrical storm were i live ( santo domingo , dominican republic ) down here we don not really have grounded outlets so surge protectors a must , the point is that i have connected my hdtv , home theater , xbox and cable box to the monster surge protector and only a speaker system is connected directly to the plug , to make the story short everything connected to the monster was ok but the speaker system and some other stuff in the house were damaged
buy it !
great product
excellent price ! i got <NUM> on my 2nd order !
this unit powers my <NUM> inch panasonic viiera hd set
we have lived through quite a few electrical storms with no issues
good solution and a good price .
replaced my ancient surge protector with this power strip that acts not only as a surge protector , but power conditioner
does it really work ? i have no idea
my municipal utility has always delivered high quality power , so i have no idea if the power conditioning is adding any value
just a leap of faith on my part
i can not notice any difference in my picture quality
i figure it can not hurt and can only help
i do like the ergonomic features
certainly color coding and labeling of which plug is for what piece of equipment is great ! no more searching for the right plug
i also like the fact that they provided <NUM> widely spaced plugs so can fit
those design features are certainly worth a premium over your average power strip
update : <NUM> years after purchasing , the thing completely died on me .
no problem thus far , appears to be doing the job as nothing has been fried yet
have it in the garage powering various rechargeable tools
in florida brownouts are a concern .
i loved this so much that i actually got a second one
it has plenty of plugs for all the &<HASHTAG> ; stuff&<HASHTAG> ; associated with a tv , and several plugs that are spaced far enough apart to accommodate the &<HASHTAG> ; wall warts
&<HASHTAG> ; using this cable i was able to consolidate from <NUM> extension cables to one
i am assuming the power is &<HASHTAG> ; clean&<HASHTAG> ; as it is advertised , as i have no way to check it
certainly a contender in this market
having the plugs labeled is a nice touch as well .
each outlet is labeled which helps in identifying your device when needing to change or move it
we have had this since <NUM> and we have gone through thunder storms , power outages , etc
and we have not had any issues with our electronic devices .
excellent for any audio/video applications
i have an lcd tv , ps3 , blu ray player , cable box , and a receiver all plugged into this and it has given me no problems
the outlets are clearly labeled , it even has <NUM> outlets that have extra space between them so you can plug items that use transformers in without covering other outlets
it comes with a monster coax cable and a phone wire
best of all is monster cable is lifetime warranty and coverage of up to $250 , 000 if the power strip fails to protect your electronics .
i bought this to hook up my buddies pa system and guitar amps when we jam and do gigs
he was getting a nasty buzzing noise previously though all of his speaker systems but now the buzzing is gone thanks to monster
this is a great purchase not only for hooking up multiple devices but for cleaning the signal noise and other stuff coming through the power lines .
this power center provided everything i need for my home theater setup
the only feature i wish it had is a shutoff option for certain accessories to eliminate phantom power .
picked up this monster hts800 power strip for my home theater system
the color coded labels are helpful
i have peace of mind knowing that the unit has a high joule rating and a huge warranty protection plan .
sorry to see it disco`ed by mfr
love the long cord
hope they make a new model of this soon and will buy again
when i need a new power stage , i turned to amazon and found this product on gold box
works well , a lot of plugs , a feed through cable connection
does the job for my 60&<HASHTAG> ; .
i had the hts800 for less than a year when one day it just stopped working
there was no lightning storm , so it is a mystery why it happened
anyway , monster technical support arranged for an exchange and i received it quickly
however , the new one fails to work out of the box
i am about to exchange this and am disappointed in their quality control -- you would think that they would at least plug it into an outlet to ensure the ac light turns on .
i gave this ht power center <NUM> stars based on the price
i didn not need a power center and only bought it for the "power cleaning" or "noise filtering"
i just finished upgrading my home theater
tv , avr , and new sub
i came across an article in a crutchfield catalog that listed this item as a good economy power filter and their test data showed that it worked well
so , for $27 i figured why not
i have no way of measuring before and after so i have no idea if it did anything for me
but again , crutchfield said it works .
i bought two of these to replace some very old units around the house and these things work really well
there is ample room for those items that have power bricks , and the power filtering has helped with an older tv that used to squeal after being on for a while .
this surge protector was a "throw in" from the dealer where i recently bought my hdtv
would i have actually bought it otherwise ? probably not
sure , it is specs are impressive and it seems to be built well
i also like the fact that the outlets are spaced widely enough to plug in a wallwort power source or two
the "problem" with stuff like this is that , unless you have some way to test it , there is no way to tell if it is providing a cleaner throughput than just plugging your gear into a wall outlet
now i certainly don not recommend not using a surge protector on expensive electronics
i have them on my main ht system , my bedroom hdtv and dvd player and my computer gear
it is certainly cheap insurance
monster has been around for years and i have used some of their cables
i have often asked myself whether or not their extra cost is worth it
all i can answer is that monster products provide me with a sense of security ( falsely or otherwise ) so i guess the peace of mind makes the $50 item worth more than the $10 item .
this product came in a timely fashion , in perfect packaging and looked brand new
however , it simply does not work
the power light is on , the ground light is on and the protection enabled light is on , however only half of the surge protector has power ( the half with only <NUM> outlets ! )
no matter what i do , where i plug it in , or how many times i reset it , the second half of the surge protector does not power anything
i am sure this product has potential , but mine did not function as expected
i am in the process of returning it for a refund
use this for my various electronic korg instruments to be plugged into
reasonable cost effective strip offers decent clamping for the price
great value
i have had one of these for over a year and just bought my second one
this is a great all around power supply
it only has monster is ( ) clean power stage 1 , so don not think your system will look and sound *noticeably* better than before
and , i have no idea why they are still including a vcr plug on this - i haven not owned one of those in <NUM> years
aside from these minor quibbles , i'd buy it again for the same setup .
i think this surge protector is great
some of the labels were not applicable to me so i had to just use an accessory plug , but everything seems to work
i love the rocker switch
i originall bought a belkins surge protector with a push button switch
i could not get the on and off switch to turn off so i returned it and bought this monster surge protecter and i am pleased .
surge protection is not the only issue one need consider with respect to television , stereo , or computer hardware
ac power noise is another aspect to consider in order to maximize the quality and life of your investments
i found the monster cable powercenter a fine small investment for surge protection while also allowing a modest improvement in tv picture quality
update a year+ later : the surge protector flat out went dead
no signs of power surge as others in the area were present and did not suddenly die
overall , as typical with monster products , overpriced and apparently not one that is long lasting .
i purchased a set of powered theater seats that would recline at a push of a button
unfortunately they didn not work properly
what has that got to do with the monster cable powercenter ? well the manufacturer of the chairs said that something one the electrical circuit for my chairs was causing the problem
well guess what , it was
by running a <NUM> ft cord to another area in my home , i was able to solve the problem
that wasn not a good solution , so i tried the monster cable powercenter
it solved the problem
the same holds true with your remote controls , audio , video equipment and dvr
yes a lot of the issue you maybe having are caused by dirty power
the monster cable provides clean power which makes everything work better .
i bought the hts800 as a replacement to the much more expensive hts950 that started making terrible noises after <NUM> years of reliable use
my primary need is to prevent my treadmill from interfering with my computer network
both units have "stage <NUM> clean power" which i assumed meant rf filtering
but while the hts950 works to filter out the noise from the ac motor in my treadmill , the hts800 does not
it is not clear what type of filtering is needed , but the hts800 does not have it
i also tried the isobar ( did not work ) and monoprice power center which finally worked .
i lost my previous radioshack surge strip and the various pieces of equipment attached to it in the queens power failure and wanted something dependable
the price is great for its rating and all the stuff included , and it is kind of too ! recommend without reservation .
just built a new home theatre and used this surge protector
does exactly what it advertises allowing multiple components to be installed at one source point and provides surge protection and insurance for a bargin price .
updated review : let me say - i am not a reactionary who goes around trashing products for no good reason
in fact , i get a little annoyed when people post reviews because they happened to get a <NUM> in a <NUM> bad copy
well , sometimes enough is enough
i ordered two of these and one was doa as described in my original review
hey , these things happen , right ? so amazon ( not monster ) sent me a replacement
it worked
forgive and forget
well , because they were such a good deal , i ordered a third one
unfortunately , i did not have a need to open it up and use it until today
guess what ? another screaming piece of junk
<NUM> out of <NUM> doa ! and of course it is far too late to send this one back
monster is credibility has gone right down the toilet in my opinion ( although i did also buy one of the big component boxes for my stereo rack and it has performed admirably , but i am done with their "power strip" models
<NUM> out of <NUM> defective units is just poor design and horrible quality control
so , there may be a reason the price of these has really fallen
feel free to take a chance , you might get a deal , just make sure you test it as soon as you get it instead of sticking it in the closet like i did
original review ( 3
5 stars ) : because of monster is reputation , it was a bit surprising to find that mine arrived doa
in reading the reviews , it seems this is more common than it should be
after nearly killing myself on the horrible blister pack and hooking up all my equipment , i found that the alarm was always screaming when the unit was plugged in
it was not the electrical service in my house
it arrived on saturday , so when i called their customer service number , naturally they were closed
so i took the easy way out and returned it to amazon ( amazing service
reported on saturday , ups picked up the broken one on monday , and new one was delivered on tuesday
no hassle
thanks , amazon ! ) new one seems to work fine
does it improve the video and sound quality of my ( all digital ) home theater ? who knows
i don not want to get into that debate , but i do feel you'd have to have very high end equipment and ears to match , or have especially dirty electrical lines , or do a lot of analog in order to definitively tell
i wouldn not come close to paying msrp , but at the fantastic price amazon is selling these for , who cares ? it is a nifty little device that offers a little extra peace of mind for only a couple of bucks more than a generic surge protected power strip
note that it also protects your phone line ( mine is voip , so it might not matter ) and tv/satellite cable
it includes a set of monster cables for each ( a claimed $27 value
i think it is an actual value of less than half that , but still , the cables alone make up for the price difference between this and an imitation power strip
) the stickers they give you for labeling your power cords is a nice touch too
note : neither of the two i received was blue , as in the photo
it is dark on the bottom , and an odd halfway between gold and silver on the top
i would have slightly preferred the blue , but it is hiding behind the av rack anyway
i am docking them a star because of the first piece of junk they sent , and i can not scientifically attest to the quality of the results , but based on their claims , the extra peace of mind , bonus cables , and low price , this is a great deal
i am going to buy a few more .
i bought this as a lightning deal and i must say , it has done its job well
all the wires and unorganized appearance of my tv was killing me on the inside
the hts <NUM> has allowed me to organize the wires , has enough for every plug and has tags that go on the cords themselves
i am not sure about the cable stabilization when it comes to image quality as my tv and cable box and wiring is relatively new
overall , it is nice and hopefully will protect the equipment in case of power surge .
i was happy to be able to pick this up on amazon for half the price that monster charges if you buy it from them directly ! it is solved the problems i was having with my laptop freezing almost every time i plugged it back into the wall
my cheap belkin power strip wasn not preventing the power spikes that this area is known for
it looks like something straight out of the 1980s , but it works !
i mainly bought this for its reliability , # of outlets and ( most of all ) the cleanpower feature
funky / dirty ac power is one of the leading causes of shortened life expectancy for electronics
some things i noticed : yes , it is plastic , but it has that good , thick plastic feel , not the cheap thin stuff that seems like it would crack when dropped
it can be hung in virtually any direction ( horiz , diag , vert ) from two screws/nails by two ( + ) hole patterns on the back of the unit
the cord is long and thick
the plug is a angle type that can be used in either the top or bottom outlet receptacle
huh ? it is not only but it doesnt hang straight down from the receptacle - imagine you plugged this into a clock face : the plug would be angled toward the "4" or "5" on the face so that you aren not limited to plugging it in the bottom plug
you could actually have two of these plugged into the same outlet
enough about that
the plug connectors are really tight fitting
you will see what i mean when you go to plug in the computer or whatever
all monster outlets are this way , and are intended to help keep the plug from falling out or being ripped out by accident
another way monster cable thinks about the small things that bug us
mine came with a phone cable that was a couple feet ( or so ) in length
cool , now i can plug the fax through the connectors on the unit
( nothing to report there
) the power switch lights up in red
comes with labels to help indentify both ends of the power cabes you are plugging in
the three "transformer" positions are great for those old box plugs for the cameras and such
plenty of room built in
i highly recommend this unit for your computer !
i bought one of these to protect my mom is computer
her house got struck by lighting and it went through the phone line and this stopped any damage from happening to her computer
the power strip was toast , so i bought her another one just like it .
i have <NUM> of these now plus two older monster strips
haven not fried anything plugged into any of these while <NUM> or less years old
like the thick cords
my house tends to have a high mortality on cheap power supplies ( electric shavers , aftermarket phone chargers , external hard drives etc
) , but they don not seem to fry plugged into these things .
i had a monster mp pc700 protecting my pc , monitor , printer and dsl modem
on the 30th of january <NUM> suffered a massive surge , three surges in <NUM> seconds
the above surge protector saved my equipment ! also , it did not catch fire or explode
my power sentry <NUM> and every other protector in my house did pop loudly and/or shoot fire ! i kissed the the monster when i was able to restart my pc ! now buying this <NUM> and several other monster cable products
i am sold for life !
great extension cable i use with some of my electronics on the go
great product , typical monster quality , at a not so monster price , surprisingly .
no interference noise and very sturdy cable
have it running a power plug to my guitar amp and have had no issues with it .
i needed an long power cable for a subwoofer , and i liked the power wall plug on this one ( couldn not find it separate anywhere )
i actually cut off the 'extension' connector and attached an iec c13 right angle power cord connector ( also purchased on amazon ) , to attach that to the sub
love the cable
very solid , thick and yet flexible
in my case , a perfect combination
very happy .
the unit i received had a female plug on one end and a male on the other , but i just cut one end off and wired the male end into my old marantz power amp
results were very nice and looks impressive
overall this cable is an excellent value as other powerline <NUM> cables were much more pricey .
i so needed a strong extension cord for my monster power surger and this is it
don not be fooled by the picture
the cord is not cut or loose like that , it is a regular male on one end female on the other end extension cord
quality , does the job and a great amazon price .
using the component input on your tv can make a huge difference in picture quality , but the differentce between the lower priced monster cables and the most expensive monster cables in not noticeable
save yourself $50 and buy the cheap ones .
i recently purchased my first hdtv , the zenith z37lz5d ( great so far ) and found the zenith dvd upconverter ( dvb 318 ) to pair it with , using monster cable m850cv
the picture quality , while acceptable , did not impress me much
the blue color saturation was obvious
a reviewer at amazon
com recommended the older monster mv2cv component video cable and i ordered it ( the player upconverts by component )
contrary to popular opinion that the cable does not matter it has made a difference in my case
the now much cheaper ( $4
00 ) mv2cv ) has given me a better picture with less blue color saturation , plus over all better picture quality than the dvd showed on the crt tv
this is an excellent cable- well recommended .
i grabbed these cables with the impression that monster is advertising has some truth in it
i was expecting a brighter/clearer image on my big screen that what i was getting with some $20 ( other brand ) cables
guess what
i haven not seen any improvement yet aside from the money that i am missing
i tried these cables and the thx certified monster cables with no observable effects whatsoever
perhaps there is a noticeble difference between these and the dinky cables included with most dvd players ( but the same can be said for the $20 cables that i was using ) .
i have already given a favorable review for this product & the vendor
what else is there to say that i haven not said .
these are great wires the quality is very nice , much nicer quality than cheaper wires
the price is very good for these wires compare to what most others charge for this same wire .
definite difference if you are using an hdtv the dvd picture is much clearer , only wondering if hdmi is even better ? only downside is , i wish the cables were about 10ft long for more slack .
i have good components , some of which don not have hdmi
so , i needed high quality componenet video cables
i got these , and it is hard to imagine better performance--even from hdmi
i run these cables from my directv dvr to my av receiver
another ( longer ) set runs from the receiver to the tv
the picture is sharp
i initially didn not get one of the connections pushed all the way onto the female end , and it didn not work
so , i pushed hard to get it on there , and it worked fine
these are tight ( that is a good thing , since you don not want loose connections )
just push hard to get them on good , and they will work great .
i compared a monster cable vs one the one from phillips which costs less than half this
and guess what , no difference
that is right
they rip you off
and what is the purpose off a gold plated connection if the rest of the signal passes through a copper cable
it irks me see the staff at bestbuy and circuit city pitching monster is $75 component cables and $120 hdmi cables at uneducated customers
there are cheaper and equally performing cables out there
do your research and save some of your hard earned money
by the way , be wary of all the glowing reviews you read on amazon for this product or for others as well
recently i have been seeing a lot of positive reviews from anonymous reviewers or reviewers with only one review to their name .
these cables are the bomb ! i could totaly tell a difference in the picture quality
if you want a good home theather system then ya gotta get these cables
you will love them like i do
it was coolbig truck
do you own a <NUM> inch tv with a $27 dvd player ? don not bother
do you own a $5000 amp , a $3000 dvd player , and a set of speakers that you might bury yourself in ? don not bother buying , unless you want to burn money
monster may look pretty , and the performance of monster vs
no name is certainly proven in the quantifiable scientific analysis
but your ear can not hear it
simply put , buy comparable cables with and without the monster name and run a test with your ears
you will probably find that you can save yourself significant $ by purchasing equally constructed cabling without the monster name .
i bought these primarily because i needed a little more reach to hook up my vcr to my receiver
it does the job fine
it didn not improve my picture
it didn not make my life suddenly worth living
it is a cable
nothing more , and nothing less
it is extra long , and it worked exactly like i wanted it too .
attention : it is important to understand you must have a component video ready tv and dvd player for this amazing monster cable to work
the monster video <NUM> component video cable <NUM> meters in length is the best off the shelf product available
this gas filled double sheilded cable with duraflex jacket eliminates those ghost and brings the sharpest , most colorful and brightest picture possible to your screen a great value and a much needed cable for your component video home theatre system
why component video ? in a nutshell : 1 )
component video is a three wire cable
( y ) - luminance ( brightness ) , ( pb ) crominance ( color - blue ) and ( pr ) crominance ( color - red )
) provides a cable with digital ( progressive scan ) and analog ( interlaced ) capability
by separating you blue and red colors this provides a pure signal to the tv where it is combined through comb filters for the sharpest picture presentation
results , the best picture available ! monster cables are the best value and provide outstanding results ! note : the next level of video excellence is moving to progressive scan see my review .
it may sound somewhat surprising , at first glance , that a short piece of cable between your tv and dvd player can make a noticeable difference in the picture quality , but once you compare a cheap cable with a good one , you will see that there is a difference ! my dvd player came with a very cable with three rca connectors on each side , and i used this cable to hook up the dvd player to the component ( rgb ) input of my tv before doing anything else
i dismissed this cable immediately as the picture was much noisier than i expected
a $15 cable performed better
however , i had to adjust the settings in video equalizer of my dvd player to increase color saturation , and also had to decrease sharpness of the picture to make noise unnoticeable
finally , i bought the monster cable ( don not tell my wife about it ! )
this cable resulted in a perfectly sharp and clean picture without any adjustments in the cd player
due to of this cable , there was no sign of the noise that i saw with the cable either
i do not know if there is a noticeable difference between this cable and a less sophisticated one that may cost half of its price
i guess , everything depends on the kind of tv and dvd player you are using
but i can say for sure that my experience convinced me that there is a tremendous difference between this cable and those from the very low end
the last thing : i do not think that it makes any sense to use such an expensive cable for a connection other than component video ( y + two color difference channels ) , also called &quot ; color stream&quot ; by toshiba
if you do not have a component video input , use either , or composite video ( video+2 audio connector )
in the latter case ( or if you need a cable to connect your vcr ) a cheaper cable would do
this one is worth the money only if you do not want to settle for anything less than perfect .
this is a great video cable , though it is very spendy
superior to composite & s video
monster classifies it as &quot ; ultimate performance&quot ;
i'd say only dvi & hdmi , which are both digital , are better
i needed a 2m or 6
5' cable because the 1m was just too short for my needs
i looked at this one ( 90$ ) and monster is new thx ulta <NUM> 4' component cable ( 100$ )
they had equal features
the thx cable is better looking than this one , however when it came down to it i didn not want to spend <NUM> extra bucks on a cable that is 2
5' shorter ! now this cable isn not thx certified , but it is certified by imaging science foundation
i typically recommend monster cable , i feel they are the leader in a/v cables
this is a great fit for a progressive scan dvd player and/or hdtv
get the most out of what you paid for ! rock on .
before you shell out big bucks for these , ask yourself if it is really necessary
because i am a sucker for perfection , i went out and purchased them
did i see a huge improvement in picture quality compared to another brand of component video cable i was using ? no
at least not on my 27&quot ; sony wega tv
okay , maybe the black levels are a bit better
i got these because i do believe better cables last a lot longer than ones
in addition , because i have so many cables running from my reciever , i figured cables with better jackets and good sheilding should cut back on video interference , producing better quality pictures .
this is from a fluke 75iii metersignal induction/crosstalk between conductors = unmeasureable
signal loss on <NUM> data wires = ~
05 ohms from pin to pin
signal loss on <NUM> ( distinct ) ground wires = ~
06 ohms , pin to pin
solder joints ( while not entriely pretty ) are not cold/flawed in any visible way
the individual ground shielding at one end of my cable was close to contact , but was not touching
overall i am pleased .
the part number is actually which makes this clearer
not sure why amazon isn not including cable lengths in their descriptions .
for some years i tried this and other monster products , to the tune of over $1000 in monster a/v gear
the more you learn about video and audio , the more you will avoid anything with the monster label
specifically , this meets no ntsc , dvd or ieee standard ; it is common hookup wire with ineffective shielding and a poorly designed , connect plug that can wreck your input jacks and gives poor grounding
has a sharp image , but includes a catalog of chromatic aberrations from skin tones to color blotching , dirty grays , burned highlights , murky shadows , noisy reds , and poor color balance due to impedance mismatching that results in cyan errors and bleeding reds
makes video test patterns look great , but who watches test patterns all day ? amazon offers many other brands at good prices , why waste your $$ on this stuff ? i removed every piece of monster from my system and replaced them with ar , belden , viewsonics and others from amazon
result : vast improvement in every respect .
i hooked these cables up to my parents toshibia dvd player
not only are the cables strong , they also transmit a really clean signal across them
i used the regular cables that came with the dvd player , and when i switched to the monster cable , the image quality improved alot and was very noticable on thier big screen tv
there is one thing i have to say , if you buy these cables , you should get them at amazon
com since you will not find the cables for this low price anywhere
i paid ( too much ) for the ones i bought
i wish i had the foresight to get them at amazon
com when i ordered the dvd player
so when you order these cables , make sure to order the other cables you need
not only will your video be great , your sound will be too .
~i bought the cable and put it between my pioneer v555 dvd player and sony wega tv , i was unable to see with my naked eyes any improvement regading the visual quality , color , sharpness
same as the result as i used the composite cable came with the box
i really don not know why
i have to say , my tv is a good one and the picture quality is already satisfactory even i don not use dvd player
unfortunately my dvd player does not have component jack to let me try the next level video~~ experience
i don not want to say this expensive cable is a poor one , i was just unable to verify its alledged ultra high performance
we just don not have a benchmark to evaluate it
the idea is good , but not completely thought out
the broad flat insulation around the wires plays havoc with a normal wire stripper , and if you were actually going to use all of the wire , there isn not nearly enough wall achors included with it to do the job
being flat , it is very awkward and difficult to make a flat <NUM> degree turn , and the wire twists like a garden hose between anchors , instead of laying flat against the wall as it is supposed to
if you really want your speaker wire to not be seen , then it needs to be run up inside the wall into the attic and across and back down inside the other wall and wired to a speaker terminal
otherwise , i think it is better to not pay so much , and just buy normal speaker wire that can be hidden along the baseboard under the carpet - or behind the floor wall trim , and alongside a door frame , etc .
i used these to power my rear speakers for my home theatre set up
they are coming from a denon 4310ci to def tech mythos gem xl is
the wire is pretty flat and i ran mine under the carpet
cutting it is a bit interesting as the flat shape does not cut with typical wire cutters and you pretty much have to trim with a knife around the wire , then twist it like normal
overall i am happy with the purchase
there is a small bump in the carpet ( both by feel and visible ) , but i have a low pile carpet and not the best pad
if you have thick pad and a medium to high pile carpet , i would think this wire would be barely noticeable under them
served its purpose and was easy to work with
thinner than regular wire of same gauge ( a little )
i would recommend .
the cables lay flat and do not curl due to a heavy insulation
i opted for these instead of the wire "tape" product since i wanted to avoid leaving tape residue on an existing wood floor
they are detectable by touch ( barefoot ) beneath the carpet , but not by sight
they more than satisfy my requirement to route rear channel surround sound speakers across a room in a
the wires are easy to strip with a type ( ) wire stripper ( example : irwin industrial tools <NUM> wire stripper with protouch grips )
supplied connectors install easily , just remember to separate the leads into a long enough "y" to allow the sleeves to pass out of the way of the connector during the crimping process
i also bought some banana plugs to use the supplied connectors didn not work , but they were too large for the flat wire/gauge combination
i am happy with the cables and would buy them again in the future .
great cable
easy to work with and very flexible
you can bend it over on itself if needed
it is a little bit wide , but i knew that from looking at the picture
it fit under my baseboard perfectly
sounds perfect !
i was needing some really good performing gear , and i saw this
im glad that ii did get it cause as soon as i hooked them up to my polks , i could instantly hear a solid diff ! some people might think as i did just not to long ago that wire doesn`t matter ? well it does more than u know ! so with that ui have to get this wire with some end clamps that are provided , but i like my banana pins
but u cant go wrong here ! the wire is thick , and bends easily
it has over <NUM> strands of pure copper in each wire ! dont pass this monster wire up if u want great performance out of any speaker , any brand .
i ran this along the baseboards and door moulding in my basement
the sound is great
wires blend in
my only suggestion is to buy more that you think you need
<NUM> feet isn not a lot ! i needed <NUM> packages for my install .
when i purchased this wire i didn not realize it was a monster product and so i was pleasantly surprised after opening the package
i have used monster xp speaker wire in my home theater for many years , but this is the first time i had a need for flat wire
i was installing rear surround speakers using a rocketfish wireless system and wanted minimal wire exposure
this very high quality wire and pins
very easy to work with and it is vanilla or off white color makes it very unobtrusive
i would buy this again .
i bought it because i wanted to have great quality cables but that &<HASHTAG> ; blend&<HASHTAG> ; with the wall i am order to avoid buying other accessories to route them to the speakers
this cable did the job
i adhered them to the wall via a light coat of silicon caulk in one side and they are firmly set
after that i painted them and they are almost invisible .
i have used this speaker wire before
i like this speaker wire cause you can hide it behind the crown molding
it is flat and is very flexible
it is easy to work with .
so far so good witht he superflat mini navajo white speaker cable <NUM> feet
it is a bit off white but it is paintable so will disappear once this room is repainted
others have had issues with the flat space between the two connection i think its perfect
it allows for the perfect distance on the receiver end and keeps the conniption on the speaker in super net
a bit pricey but you get what you pay for
i recommend
easy to work with , flat cable
used this type as customer wanted to run it along wood floors and hide behind molding
very thin design , carries sound well .
this cable really isn not that flat - it is about <NUM> to 2
5 mm ( 1/10th inch ) thick , and 14mm ( 0
55 in ) wide
( the thickness dimension at the monster site is wrong
) not really enough thinner than regular wire , and not ( see below )
it may be best for running along baseboards , etc
it is a little too thick to run under most carpets , or to paint and have it actually disappear
monster doesn not like to tell you the gauge of cables , but these are <NUM> awg
which is just fine for up to about <NUM> feet , maybe more
google speaker wire for some discussion on what size wire you need for a given distance from the receiver to the speaker
the design could be improved , maybe that is why these are sharply discounted lots of places
as noted , they aren not at all superflat
there is a chunk of plastic down the center that seems unnecessary - maybe it is there to provide a place to attach ( nail , screw , staple ) , but it is just taking up space that could have been used to make the wire flatter instead
if you are willing to pay a lot more ( about $1/foot ) you can get truly flat speaker wire
but , since this cable is available for a fraction of list if you look around , it might suit your needs for a specific installation
the color is an , with a slightly yellowish tinge
sort of a cream color
but - and here is another design flaw - one wire is marked on one side with a silver line , with "superflat mini" and a bunch of other text every foot
it is much more than is needed to mark the polarity of the wire ( to make sure you connect + to + and - to - on the speakers )
so it means that only the unmarked side of the wire is really usable - a <NUM> flat turn on a surface flips the text out onto the exposed side of the wire - unless you plan to paint this
the sflm gp50 package includes <NUM> red/black pairs of straight termination pins , crimp to attach
they don not seem designed for this wider wire , though - they are really meant for standard round wire
there are also <NUM> clamps ( to hold the wire to the wall ) and <NUM> "corner trim" pieces ( for making a <NUM> turn by folding over the wire and putting it into the trim )
not enough clamps for a whole run , if you use them , but might be handy
file this under products that could be a lot better .
i set up a new home theater system and used the superflat to connect my right , left and center speakers ( rear are wireless )
i love the hue and the flat jacket lies almost flush against the wall
the wire is soft and pliable and easy to work with : bends around corners like a champ and is easy to cut and strip
flat wire jackets might be tricky to strip with a cheap stripper--typical rat shack round hole strippers--but theirwin industrial tools <NUM> wire stripper with protouch gripsmade short work of the flat jacket
the included pins are a bit too small for my taste
they really look like "pins" and were a struggle to squeeze this <NUM> gauge wire into
surely more surface area is better for signal conductivity at the speaker and amp terminals
also , the amazon product photo shows banana plugs but the description says pins
i should have read the description more carefully
luckily i have plenty of banana plugs , so i installed those instead
finally , although the included wall anchors work great , monster was really stingy with them as there isn not nearly enough for <NUM> feet
the superflat sound and look great but i dinged them a star for the stingy terminal pins and wall anchors and the misleading product image .
the cable itself is great
very flat and easy to hide
the speaker connectors that came with it aren not that great
they are not extremely easy to put on
the seller delivered my item in a good time
no complaints there .
this is a great splitter
i just got my digital cable hooked up and the internet was not working correctly
the cable guy was about to disconnect the interent and put in a repair order becuase he said that i had a low signal in my place
i recommended that he use one of these splitters instead of the one that he had from comcast and it improved the signal and got the internet working
he asked me where i got this from because he was going to start using these splitters .
i used this to split the video portion of my cablevision digital io service and it worked perfectly
this is actually a second splitter on my line since the first provided by cablevision is used to split the signal into tv and cablemodem lines .
i was having a lot of problems with cable access in my apartment and i wanted to do something about it
i had <NUM> tvs and two computers sharing the same cable signal , and in the bedrooms i was getting a lot of static on the tv at the upper range of channels
well i got tired of it , and the cable tech ( over the phone ) said they tested the pipe going into the apartment and it was fine , so i decided to take matters into my own hands
i went into the closet and found that they had used a really crummy splitter , and after unscrewing the wall panel in my bedroom i found another one in there
well , i bought two of these monster splitters and immediately replaced them
i am not going to say they fixed the problem , because they didn not , but they fixed it about <PERCENT> , which was enough to make the problem go away entirely in <NUM> of the rooms -just not in the 3rd one
if you are having problems with signal degradation it might be worthwhile to check if the splitters are part of the problem by buying one and testing it out
it is a low cost , low hassle option , and you can always use a splitter of your own somewhere
i have had good luck with monster products .
this worked just for what i needed it for , to split standard cable signal
was a little expensive compared to others but look at the name brand , lolmake sure it supports the signal for what you need
some people may need ones that go above the 2ghz but it all depends what you are using it for
for standard cable works great
for cable modem , digital cable or sat tv , do research for your provider first and make sure it will be fine for you .
while i am no big fan of typically and monster products , i will readily concede that this beats any of the <NUM> or <NUM> other splitters i tried
i see comments here from users who say they can not see a difference with this product ; my comment to them is that they need a better tv
i also noted one reviewer who somehow heard that this splitter can not be used with catv ( it can , and i have been using mine for over a year with my digital cable hookup )
advantages : less noise and grain than others i have used , and channels at the frequency band extremes look much better than my cable company is "free" piece of junk
most notably , this splitter maintains excellent image contrast and has no visible chroma effects that i can see
few splitters can manage all this
the only product i have tried that might beat this is a $[
] job whose brand i don not remember ( probably because i ain not spending $[
] on a splitter , for any reason )
even if you are not crazy about monster in general , you will get your money is worth here
i am using two in my setup with a celabs booster amp .
when cox cable installed cable in my home they had the main cable feed a <NUM> way splitter that all went to different rooms in my house
that was fine
when i called them back to add another connection ( the cable was already run ) they were apparently too lazy or too cheap to put in a splitter outside so they just tapped into an existing connection and installed a <NUM> way splitter in the attic
while i always had an ok picture on the <NUM> sets that were affected by this installation they were always a little fuzzy ( especially on the lower channels ) and would sometimes ghost for a few minutes
i bought the monster splitter because it was a lot easier to try and change out the splitter that cox installed than to replace the splitter outside
ok , it wasn not easier , but it was cheaper
i am happy to say that it worked great
i compared the picture on those <NUM> sets to one that is fed directly from the box outside and there isn not any difference in the picture
this thing works
] .
i bought this along with a monster cable
now i know monster is way over priced but i think this splitter is worth it
i wanted to hook up my cable modem and my cable tv with no loss to my cable modem and it did what it said it would
i wont give it <NUM> stars because i know it is [
] .
did exactly what i needed
split the cable from my wall to the tv and cable modem .
after making some recent upgrades in my primary audio/video system it became clear that the two way splitter that the cable company provided was simply inadequate to the task
upon doing some research i determined that this particular splitter made by one of the industries most reputable manufacturers was going to have to be the way to go
upon hooking up this superior splitter in conjunction with monster is mv3f2m nf video <NUM> coaxial cables there was quite a wonderfully distinct difference in the picture on my new television
after seeing such a distinct improvement in the signal for my primary audio/video system i immediately went out and purchased another one for the computer room to use for both the cable modem and the television in that room
this is the perfect splitter for either a television/cable modem hookup or a television with pip ( ) capability in conjunction with a cable box or satellite receiver ! i highly recommend this outstanding cable splitter to any and all who are interested in getting the best picture available from their television sets or signal for their cable modems
the end results far outweigh the costs for this splitter ! {ssintrepid}
we have a very home theater system , which clearly shows the contribution for good or ill of every component
we pulled this turkey instantly and sent it back .
i checked out a few splitters before i purchased this one
i used it in conjunction with a motorola signal booster and with the combination i am more than satisfied with the picture quality ; i am very happy i made the purchase
picture quality is great !
my boyfriend and i had gone to radio shack to buy what we thought would be a good splitter for my satellite/vcr hookup with my tv
when we looked at what they had to offer my boyfriend figured then and there that it wasn not going to work but we bought it anyway for $[
] , needless to say , he was right
it didn not work , not even a little bit
i searched on amazon
com for the splitter i needed and due to the high recommendations i read on the site i ordered two of the monster cables and they are working great
since then when i go to any electronics store i haven not seen any splitters quite like these so i would highly recommend using the monster cable ( two gigahertz rf splitters for tv & satellite <NUM> gigahertz ) especially for your satellite - you can not go wrong .
what the cable companies provide in 1ghz cheapo coaxial splitters is insufficient to get the best tv picture quality , particularly if one has several coaxial cable connections relating to tv is and broadband internet
i found in using the increased bandwidth of the monster splitters of 2ghz having improved the sharpness of analog and digital cable tv reception
additionally , as more people are opting for hdtv sets and broadband internet connectivity , reducing signal loss will provide one potential improvement relating to multiple connections
other issues relate to dirty ac power interference and the quality of the cabling used , ( such as superior performance in or composite cables ) , so the solution to maximize your signal quality is multifaceted
it is recommended to use either the <NUM> or <NUM> splitter variation
the model has more signal loss
use the splitters at the entry point and where one splits coax between the tv and other components such as dvd/dvr is .
i really hate having to split a line
it lowers the signal strength a lot , exposes the signal to interference , and creates a failure point
there isn not much you can do if you need a split , though , other than doing it as well as you possibly can
this is a very heavy duty splitter
it has high gauge lines , and a outer grounded shell to keep out interference
while it is true that standard cable signals do not go over ( or even approach ) one gigahertz , i like that this one is designed to handle the much more difficult to protect two gigahertz signals that are used in dss satellite dishes
frequencies that high are difficult to keep from leaking out , so if it can handle those i know i don not have to worry about the lower cable frequencies leaking out either
overkill for most , but cheap insurance to help protect a common source of noise and interference .
this 2ghz splitter is sooo good , i would easily pay twice the price for it and it would still be worth every penny ! i have a tv tuner in my computer that has the cable signal passing through four of these monster cable 2ghz splitters , and there is virtually no signal degradation , most notably on the troublesome lower band channels like <NUM> and 3
the reception on our tv is the best it has ever been , too , using this splitter and the mc coax cable
_before_ i installed these mc splitters , i was using the best splitters available from one of your favorite national electronic parts suppliers around the corner , and the signal for channels <NUM> and <NUM> was basically dead on arrival with extremely snowy picture and noisy sound interference
great job , monster cable ! you have done it again by proving that nothing else compares
thank you !
the point many people need to understand when purchasing a splitter is that spitters split you signal
every split that occurs reduces the quality of that signal
buying a better <NUM> ghz splitter such as this one may reduce the loss of signal quality , but do not expect miracles , after all , you are still splitting a signal without adding any power yourself
the splitter probably will not improve quality in the following conditions : 1 ) you replace a splitter with a better one , but your tvs already have the best quality they can with the split they have
2 ) you replace a splitter with a better one , but the tvs require a rather low signal anyway , so any split would go unnoticed
3 ) the signal arriving at your house or apartment is already weak , in which case the splitter would not do any good
4 ) you are adding a splitter to a system that does not have one
in these conditions , you may see the best improvement : 1 ) have a high signal demanding system , such as digital cable , tivo , and hdtvs
2 ) have your cable split to the limit , very low quality video when normally splitting
3 ) have an internet line , one of the best parts of this splitter is for internet usage/tv splitting , may see an increase in speed of internet
given these criteria in mind , i had a good experience with this device
i moved into a new apartment , which had relatively bad signal
i wanted to split it three ways , into my computer tv tuner , my digital cable box + tv , and a tv in my bedroom
i purchased this teamed with an <NUM> db signal amplifier ( what actually does add power to a system )
the signal clarity improvement was minimal , which i believe is because my apartment building does not have a very good signal before it even reaches me
however , before adding these devices , i could not plug into my computer without completely losing my signal to the point i could not watch it
this was of course with a cheaper cable company provided splitter
after replacing the splitter and adding the amp , i could set my computer up , and have all three devices on and using the cable without seeing a single drop of signal degradation
think what you will , but i say this device is a noticeable improvement
it all depends what you think a signal improvement is worth and taking the chance that you will meet the criteria for the signal improvement
there is no for sure way to predict if a better splitter will improve your video quality
you just have to try it and find out .
boy did it ever ! the cable company came and installed our cable modem and used a cheap splitter
i upgraded to this and the difference was amazing
our cable internet seems to run better and the tvs seem to have better picture
maybe its just an illusion , but after using my parents internet modem with a cheap splitter , maybe not
well worth the extra money .
i bought the <NUM> way splitter since i have a cable modem connection and i live in an old building with only one cable outlet and i have <NUM> tvs
of course , my cable connection was already split with the one tv and the modem ; i was worried that adding the second tv would slow down my cable modem connection--happily , my worries were for naught
the splitter was easy to install , and within no time , i had <NUM> tvs with great reception and a blazing fast internet connection
i even have a router and it all works well together
i am delighted with this product and would recommend it to anyone who has limited cable connections and does not mind having a cable running from one room to another .
i bought this one at amazon market place ( the splitter was made in taiwan ) to replaced my old cheap splitter out side the house is tv cable box
the tvs picture quality look the same and cable internet speed doesn not get any faster
the worse is my internet was cut off when the tv is turn on with this fancy splitter
i had to switch back my old two dollars splitter
wasted times and money
may be those lucky guys have good result with this monster splitter was made in usa .
i needed a quality splitter for my digital cable and i couldn not find anything of quality at the local shack
anyway i found this splitter on amazon and it does the job great
picture quality on the outputs of the splitter is great
i'd recommend this .
- monster name brand , means high prices , but i have never been disappointed with monster products ! - performs well from what i can tell , have <NUM> cable boxes running off it , and its perfect
- quick shipping and a nice price from amazon
- be aware it has <NUM> splits , and the 5th is the cable in .
i don not know how monster charges these prices with a straight face
my cable guy said "we don not use these" -- "not recommended" -- "does not improve reception"
my cable company uses standard , , lower cost , splitters
they work just fine !
i choose this rating because of the company
monster cable make excellent product and are high grade product
the item works great
i needed it for hooking up a <NUM> tvs , computer , and the internet .
 <NUM> words , you bet ! i was having a problem with my newly installed cable tv
i had light and dark horizontal bands that would come and go , mostly come
i had read that the splitters cable companies use are cheap and unsatisfactory
i decided to spend a few extra dollars and go for the monster <NUM> gig <NUM> way splitter
i installed the splitter and viola ! no more bands , perfect picture ! i also use monster video <NUM> coxial cable for the connection from the wall to the splitter and from the splitter to my dvd recorder
if your picture quality is lacking and you are on the fence not wanting to fork out a few extra bucks , believe me it is definitely worth it .
appears to work as advertised and is currently being used to connect two homerun and one tv
all signals appears to be the same .
monster has created a great mythology about "smooth sonic performance" and all kinds of other benefits to using their , quite expensive splitter
the main difference in splitters is in the accuracy of the internal construction , whether or not a circuit board is used , and the quality of the shielding box construction and the transformer core material
however , there is one thing to remember , and it is a biggie : if you have digital cable , the subtleties of rendition in either video or audio are virtually *independent* of the quality of the box
normal cable is "analog"
if you have interference or a weak signal , you get bars , snow , crackly sound , either all the time or periodically
maybe your poor quality splitter needs to be replaced
with digital cable , you either "get it" or "you don not"
when you have weak signal , you will have horribly choppy , blocky looking video ( or none at all ) ; same goes for the audio
if everything is working ok , upgrading your splitter won not incrementally improve your audio or video quality
in fact , nothing will , except perhaps a new tv or a better set top box with better output circuitry behind the decode stage
adding an expensive , overpriced splitter with gold plated hoohaws may stave off corrosion <NUM> years down the line , but so will a thin layer of silicon grease
it certainly won not give you "smoother sonic performance" or any of those "subtle" differences that they claim are "worth it
"just so you know .
previously adelphia had setup my cable using two daisy chained <NUM> way splitters
this caused my hd signals to drop very frequently , especially on hbo
it was so bad that i couldn not watch the hd feed at all
i was told that this would not solve my problem from a local high end a/v store , but they were dead wrong
once i replaced the <NUM> splitters with <NUM> splitter my signal was perfect
in fact , the reception on the analog stations also improved dramatically
to ensure the best signal i have also added other hardware : <NUM> motorola drop amp , <NUM> monster <NUM> way loss loss splitter , then a monster powercenter hts <NUM> with video filtering .
works great
actually improved snr ( signal noise ratio )
to check your signal turn on tv and cable box then turn off cable box only and press ok/select button or menu button ( depends on cable box ) on remote
look at the inband status snr and the oob ( out of band ) status snr and agc ( auto gain control ) it will tell you your signal strength good , fair , poor , or invalid so your can troubleshoot your connections
i needed to add and cable drop for my dock and i was worried about the drop in power to my cable modem
the monster work great
all the tvs are working and the cable modem is still fast .
it does its job gold and 2gig <NUM> way great speed i still use it
over priced and the signal loss and picture quaility is no better then when using the low cost units
save your money .
item works good
works even better when connected to another splitter that works in the <NUM> ghz range
i noticed that when i used a lower end splitter that didnt support 2ghz it did not work as well
so match up all your splitters to be the same kind .
i really don not get it how monster just gets away pricing their junk like this
i got this months ago to fix some loss issues
saw this shiny think with overpriced tag , and thought it will resolve the issue
after using this the hd was creating problems , tvs in my other rooms were having huge issues with signal
finally went back to comcast is splitter and all was well
they recommended not to use this
i totally agree
nice gold plating though
can be in a display cabinet
not just this monster product , but so many of their products are simply overpriced when compared to the same quality ( in some cases average than normal quality ) .
monster has always charged more for their products because they are well made and last longer than those of their competitors
the product itself is well contructed and best in class
the premium price reflects the quality of the product .
yes , the price is just great
with my $25 gift certificate , i can get the thing for about $8
i just test the first disc , and it went fine for the first hour
but towards the end of the disc , i start to hear big skipping/shuttering
it is just like playing mp3 on a busy computer
i hope that i have time to test the rest of the discs today and give it a recoomendation .
after buying my minidisc player , i bought these little discs because they were cute and on clearance
they have yet to let me down
i can make cds and listen to them in my minidisc player , my computers and my dvd player .
i have used md for <NUM> or <NUM> years , and have used a variety of disks
and as a digital media , naturally buying the cheapest md has its appeal , because as long as the media works at all , it is going to sound the same
however it might not be worth getting this brand
i keep pretty good care of the md is , but of the <NUM> i bought when i first got into minidiscs , <NUM> or <NUM> have had problems where the metal slide either comes off in my pocket , or sticks open
i have been able to get them back on right , but i have made concert recordings that i'd *hate* to lose , i'd prefer the problem didn not come up at all
i haven not had a problem with one coming off in the player , and i don not think that will happen , but you hate to take chances with an expensive player
so it might be worth getting these md is if they are at the right price , and if you can stand to lose what you have recorded to the md
still , i have taken to buying sony , and using the remaining blank memorex md is only sparingly .
when i was placing my first order for <NUM> discs , i was worring about the quality , because i have seen some concerns over here , among reviews
but after , i tested the first delivery , i was so excited about it , and decided to order another set of <NUM> discs
i use them every day for recording lectures at my college using lp4 mode in my sony
a also use <NUM> sony colored md74 discs , and i noticed some jitter with them , which did not happen with my memorex discs
i think , memorex is a great deal for those , who are independent in mind from the brand and is more concentrated on the quality .
i have read some reviews on these discs
they serve their purpose
the colors are cool , but need individual boxes
that way , they will be more compact
i have seen my discs fall out of the flimsy dust free case
so far there are no problems with the discs themselves
it is great that you can record about 1000x on them
at least if one breaks , it doesn not cost a lot to replace them
they are less than
actually , my discs say there is <NUM> minutes of recording time
well , i can not say much more
if you like memorex products , get these cool little discs
did my review help you ?
well , i needed some minidiscs just so i could record a bunch of cd is and take them up to work , which is where i mainly use my portable player
i haven not recorded on them all yet , but so far <NUM> of them are messed up--either they appear to record correctly and then can not be played , or they won not even start recording
they seem like a good value , but if you take out the <NUM> that have failed ( so far ) i am paying the same amount for these as other discs , and these don not come without cases
i give them <NUM> star because zero stars isn not an option !
 ( 1 ) as the title says
( 2 ) the only potential drawback is that the minidiscs don not come in individual plastic cases
they still come with larger plastic cases that are just fine for carrying discs around .
when very little seperates one product from another , one must ultimately judge that product on minute detalis
and here is my gripe
petty as it may sound , the labels keep peeling up
at first it is a minor annoyance , but when the things get stuck in the player because of the label , that is just silly
i have actually gone to the length of using labels from other mini discs
it all sounds stupid yes ? but why pay money for something that displeases you ? i switched to tdk , and they are a better value , and- the labels stay put !
buy sony or tdk
these are made cheaply .
the is such a versatile media , and these are the best blank mds in the marketplace
their strength is that they come in a great storage bin to help keep them organized
once again , memorex comes through !
the hardware is great , the provided software could be better ( except for the driver , which is fine )
while browsing and email work fine , i like to be able to ping from dos , and this port is blocked for some reason
if you have windows <NUM> second edition , i would only install the driver , then set up file and print sharing manually and use ics ( which comes with windows <NUM> second edition ) to share your internet connection
but i love the cards themselves ! get a linksys befsr41 router and a linksys homelink broadband bridge , and you won not need to use a pc at all in order to share your internet connection !
i am an old hand at networking - i have been doing it since i was <NUM> ( i am <NUM> now )
this device works as advertised
in fact , i was only running a <NUM> mbps thinnet network in my home before , and my new hpna network ( made of <NUM> of these cards ) marginally outperforms the coax
over telephone wire ! without interfering with the phone ( or vice versa ) ! wow ! wow ! this is a great time we live in
a note : if you are a novice with networking , i don not know how well the included networking software works
as i said , i am very familiar with networking , so i just installed the drivers and configured windows' networking myself
if you know what you are doing , however , this is a definitely a great product .
i bought two of these cards to network both my children is computers which sit in each of their bedrooms at one end of the house
the card physically is very easy to install , provided you have an empty pci slot ( if not , then use usb adapter )
one computer runs w98se , and the second runs me
the driver cd works fine , even better with me since driver installs automatically
it plugs into any working phone jack , and you are all networked and ready to surf the net
everything needed is included in the package
you can be on line and still use your phone without any degradation in either signal
the 10x connection is quite fast and not noticeably different than your 10/100 wired ethernet connection
i have a broadband cable modem , hooked to my router
one of my router is lan ports is hooked a phoneline bridge ( netgear pe102 , another great product ) , and the bridge to a phone jack
i definitely recommend this card , with a bridge , if you want to set up a home phoneline network .
in my first review a failed to mention what systems and software i was running
i believe this may be the cause of many people is woes
i run these cards on <NUM> very different systems : 1 ) amd athlon 1ghz biostar mb 2 ) intel p90 "micron" who knows what kind of mb 3 ) intel p133 "gateway" ditto on the mbbut , for all three , i am running windows 98se ( second edition )
i believe the determining factor in getting your pc is to talk to each other using this device and provided drivers is having the same operating system on each platform
as i recall , during software installation for the netgear cards , i was required to "insert the windows installation cd" for the complete software installation
as the netgear software relies on windows networking software this is key to getting these things working
there are a lot of differences between windows95 , windows98 , and windowsme , especially in the area of networking
netgear is installation should overcome these differences , or at least document the problems
for this i am downgrading my rating to only <NUM> stars .
this product works as advertised
the rates are close to 10mbps and the setup was very easy
if your looking for a phone line wireless adapter , this is a great choice .
the cards networked just fine , but internet connection sharing will not work
netgear techsupport iss free , but useless
they told me to call microsoft
documentation is very skimpy and the online info is not much better
i am going to try wingate and if ics still won not work , yank the cards !
i have a small office networked with these cards
works fine for printer and file sharing
cannot get it to share online connection
what really has me puzzled though is the fact i had two of the computers at my house networked with the same cards and they could share the connection .
con este tipo de tarjetas de memoria he podido almacenar con rapidez fotografias de alta resoluci&oacute ; n y sin ningun problema de funcionabilidad
con respecto a usarlas para almacenar informacion de ipaq u otro tipo de pocket pc , tambien funcionan muy bien
son bastante seguras para hacer copias de seguridad de la informacion de su pocket pc

this is a quality product that holds up
i have been using viking products for a couple of years now ( modems , memory , etc
) and i have had no complaints about any of their products
amazon is price on this <NUM> mb card makes it a steal ! don not pass up on this great deal .
not much to review
if 32mb is all you need then this is the card for you .
i use this little with my hp jornada 545
and well i have nothing to say , and that is simply because there are zero issues
i just plugged it in , and the integration was seemless
no problems , whatsoever
this card does all of what the makers say , exactly , every time
this product is flawless and high quality .
well , i had no idea how much room a <NUM> mp picture would take up on a cf card
i know it is a combination of compression and format , but i never really did the math
great price : i bought this card , number one , because the price was great
now the price is even greater when you get it for about 2mb for $1
number of pictures that can be stored : 155 in a dc240 with 1mp
55 in a dx3900 with 3
1 mp
i never knew the mp versus mb formula , this practical application helped me out
i understand however , much depends on your compression and format
this was all
jpg files and on kodak cameras
seems compatible for pda and pc : i know one of the concerns on these cards is compatibility
since i have had it , i have put it in an <MENTION> pocket pc , on the pcmcia card on an ibm laptop and a kodak dx3600 and a hp315
it worked great
nice card and a nice size , i am set for awhile now .
bought since it was the cheapest , but lo ! it works just fine in my canon elph s110
no complaints , and that is a compliment .
all compact flash memory brands are basically the same
as best i can tell they are made in <NUM> factories in jakarta indonesia sub contract
i would therefore buy based on price only
the product is shipped with a notice stating that installation instructions are to be seen on viking is web site which , for me , has thus far failed to load .
not much to say about a memory disk
like any other types of memory cards , it basically store the same way
the price is reasonable
my advice : stick with the same storage media throughout your purchase .
wowi just plugged this card in my jornada and had room for up to <NUM> mp3 songs
now i have a mobile mp3 player
you may say that i have a pretty much expensive mp3 player , but this comment is just to show you how fast this compactflash card is
right now we are developing applications for pocket pcs and this is a must have accesory in order to have backups and copies of every prototype we are working onnow , i am just wondering if the 128mb compactflash card is compatible with my jornada
i will find it out later
i have used viking components in the past and never had any negative experiences with their products
when i got a digital camera , i shopped the local computer and mall stores for compact flash memory cards before turning to amazon
i was pleasantly surprised to find an affordable compact flash card in the capacity i was looking for made by viking
the card works great with my kodak digital camera and sandisk cf reader
a top notch product at an affordable price .
i purchased it to raise my jornada 548 is memory up to <NUM> mb
i read elsewhere flashcards would be a must if i wanted to play mp3 on it
just open the lid , insert it , and
voil&aacute ; ! no drivers , no special software required
a highly recommendable accessory .
an excellent cf card
its is very fast at reading and writing data ( a weakness in some cf cards ) and it is very reliable
i have yet to have one single problem with this card
i doubt i will buy any other brand of cf card
viking has done a great job .
i used one for a couple of weeks now
so far i have noticed no problem .
first i bought a sandisk and after a month of use got damaged , i tryed to comunicate with them a lot , they have the worst customer service , then i gave up
then i bought this viking like a year ago , and im still using it .
installed <NUM> mb card into my ipaq for immediate memory increase
works like a champ !
128m is great
but since 256m is available now at a great price , get 256m instead
a cf card is a cf card for the most part , and this card has given me absolutely no problems
got a good price on it here , so i got it for my new canon s230
very happy .
i bought a <NUM> mb card a year ago and in december it got soaked in water at a disney waterpark
i fished it out of the camera , saw it was completely soaked
so hoping for the best i dried it with the hotel hair dryer ( on cool ) as it had all my disney vacation pics on it
and i could not bear to throw it away without checking
wonder of wonders it still worked though my canon a70 camera had no such luck , and i was able to download all my photos
i am still using it everyday since then in my new canon camera as i am an avid photographer
i take about pictures a day and delete them at the end of the day once i download them onto my computer
i am quite happy with it as even with a <NUM> mp camera on high resolution it gives me enough memory for about a <NUM> photos and since i download frequently to my laptop even when on vacation i have never needed more
all in all great value for money !
what a world ! when we bought this memory card , it was big
you know the rest of this story ! what would you use a measly <NUM> mb for now ? <NUM> pictures ?
i can not say much for or against this card
it is not flashy or &quot ; usb enabled&quot ; ( does anybody ever use that feature anyway ? ) but it does exactly what i expected it to , at a reasonable price .
so far , the only way i have been able to obtain my rebate is to pester the rebate company for months until they finally decide i am not going to give up until i get my rebate
not worht it
the company uses a web site called "wheresmyrebate" com
do not trust them
other than that , the card is excelent and i recomend the card , just not the company policies .
i have not seen a cheaper price , and i have been looking in stores
this is a good value
keep in mind , though , unlike the cheaper versions of this card , this card does not come with a flash reader
i was disappointed to find this out , but it was my own fault for just assuming it did
i still give it <NUM> stars
[a note to hp jornada <NUM> customers
this card works fine with the jornada pocket pc
i say this because it is not mentioned in the advertisement that the 128mb version is compatible , but it is
]one nice thing about this card is that there is 24/7 tech support available if something should go wrong with it ( or with installation or whatever ) , but i don not know what could really go wrong with it --i guess that is why they offer the tech support ! anyone using mp3s should really go for this card and skip the <NUM> mb card
the <NUM> mb card would be rather skimpy , and with <NUM> mb you will always find things to store on it
( i have had my card three days now and i have filled up <NUM> mb already , downloading songs , books , and maps )
one nice thing about having a flash card for a pocketpc ( or other handheld ) is that you can back up your entire regular memory onto your flashcard easily , without having to worry about memory failure
that is pretty neat , kind of like a second hard drive for your computer .
the <NUM> meg card by viking provides the perfect balance of affordability and space
this card allows me to shoot over <NUM> 1024x768 shots with my canon elph s110
i bought this with my canon a20 and haven not looked back
works just fine for digital photography .
i would avoid this compact flash card-- i have gone thru two , both which proved to be defective .
no complaints about this card
it works just as well as any other card i have tried in my canon s110
it holds <NUM> highest quality images
good value for the money .
even though i retired the camera i bought this card for , the card is still in use
i use it for a digital picture frame that i have without any problems
the price was right too .
this seems like an excellent value for the money , but it is not quite as good as it seems
after receiving it , i learned that it only has 120mb of space on it
perhaps they are cheap because they had some defects that make 8mb or so unusable
it works fine
i would just divide the price by 120mb instead of <NUM> to find the true value
i would also highly recommend using the viking pcmcia card reader for compactflash
it simply shows up as another drive in windows with no driver software to load
you might get a deal by buying the memory and card reader together .
i use this card with a canon g1 camera
haven not had a single problem
stores <NUM> or so raw images
downloads are fast and haven not had a single reliability issue
i like compactflash cards as they are much more sturdier and viking components did well on this one
i recommend this card for anyone who has a digital comera that takes compactflash cards
this card , including the rebate , is the best value for a <NUM> mb card
i did not notice any differences between this card and my kodak cf card in terms of speed of transfers , previewing pictures on the camera , or reading from a card reader
as noted , the rebate period is ridiculously short as you must submit within <NUM> days of the purchase date
if you get super saver shipping , you are really cutting it close
i did not make the deadline since i put it off a few days .
i purchased this card for my hp jornada 548
it was easy to install and made an immediate , detectable difference in the operating speed of my machine
the next one i buy is for my nixon coolpix 990 .
makes the new digital camera ( a canon powershot a20 ) fully functional
set at small resolution/ definition , this card gives me <NUM> photos ! functions smoothly with both camera and card reader
a great deal for the price !
i bought the 128mb card mnths ago
at first didnt notice it but the usable memory kept getting smaller ! finally it gave a 'error reading card' message and stopped working
customer service at viking was very very helpful and prompt
they replaced the card is <NUM> days
they also tried to retrieve some of the images that i had considered 'lost' in the card and sent me a cd with the images on it ! i was impressed with the excellent support , but not too impressed that the card died so early in its life
would i buy it again ? yes but likely go for keeping a backup card on hand at all times as well .
the formatted size of this card is 121mb only , not 128mb
maybe viking is using the same calculation as in other storage devices like hdd ? anyway , on my new canon powershot g2 , it can store <NUM> raw images
it is not bad
remember to calculate the price/mb ratio : it is very close to 340mb microdrive
moreover , solid state device ( ram ) is always faster than mechincal devices ( hdd ) and draw less power
i personally choose this because the price and performance is right
other sizes ( 64mb , 256mb , or microdrives from ibm etc
) are not as good as this
as of today , of course ( 10/23/01 )
this card is just the right size for weekend trips
it holds more than enough pictures
i have never had any trouble with it , in fact i bought two !
this is a very good cf card , which also is fast
there exists some cheaper cards on the market but i know some of them are slower
using the card in a digital camera you don not want a too slow card that will make you wait for the image to be stored before you can take next image
there is only one thing you need to consider before you buy this card : is it big enough ?
unlike lexar or sandisk , viking does not design or make the components that go into their flash memory cards , instead they use components ( controller and memory core ) made by others
this means two things : 1 ) lower cost ( to viking ) , and 2 ) compatibility with devices may not be as robust as lexar or sandisk
there have been numerous reports about incompatibility between viking flash memory and various digital cameras and pdas
you should do a web search before buying this product
that said , this viking cf card should work in most digital cameras or older pocket pcs that take cf
the rated speed of 8x means this is not suitable for digital slr is such as the nikon d70 or canon eos digital rebel which need cf cards ( 40x or higher )
most consumer , digital cameras will find the speed of this card more than adequate
128mb holds about 5mp , pictures ( depending on the complexity of each picture and the particular camera model )
i personally recommend if you have a 4mp or more camera , you should have a 256mb memory card as your primary card , while carrying a 128mb card like this viking as a spare
in short , this viking 128mb cf card is good for the money
just make sure it is compatible with your digital camera .
i have a canon powershot digital camera ( 2
1 mp )
with my viking <NUM> mb compact flash card , i can store <NUM> digital photos at high resolution ! compact flash memory is often $1 per mb , but this was much less ( including the rebate from viking , which i got as promised )
overall , a good deal for a good product .
i bought this for my kodak dc4800 3
1 megapixel camera
the images are memory hogs , so i bought this card to augment the <NUM> mb card that came with it
the card works just as well as my kodak card--no noticeable performance differences whatsoever
and , this card costs way less than similar offering directly from kodak or other providers
i love kodak , but not enough to spend twice as much money for their product ! oh , and amazon
com has the best price for this that i have seen .
 <NUM> year and still working ! - more than i can say for some other brands .
i got a canon a40 for christmas , and is came with a small 8mb canon cf card to store pictures on
at high resolution ( its a 2
0mp camera ) i could store <NUM> pictures
with this card i was able to stores nearly 200
i don not know about you , but i don not take <NUM> pictures in a week , not even in two weeks usually
even when i go on vacation
this card provides more than enough storage for pictures or small movies taken with your digital camera , and if you buy a cf card reader , its a great way to back up your files when windows , or just when transfering files from a pc to a mac .
i have enjoyed using this card
occasionally every couple of months , my camera ( nikon coolpix 3200 ) will give me a message saying there is a problem with the card , but when i turn my camera off and on , everything is fine and no data is lost
i don not know how common this problem is , but since it is occasional , it is not worth it to me to get a new card
i enjoy the extra memory this card provides ; just enough for an amateur photographer .
i used this card for my canon s10 camera , and just love it
the write and read time are as comparable with the orginal canon memory and i also compare the performance with my simple tech 64mb cf card and it is as good as the simple tech card
no problem with it , and loving it .
i installed this card in my jornada 690 , and its about twice as fast as my old compact flash card
it detects itself faster without much delay , etc
i would not recommend putting startup items on the card , and expecting them to load as fast as internal ram ( i tried that , and the card could not compete with internal ram )
but hence for a cf card this is as fast as i have used ! i recommend .
great price on a great flash card
i needed one more flash card so i could stop juggling the flash cards i already have between devices every few days
( kodak dc4800 camera , hp handheld computer , dc50 , etc
) especially when traveling , i take lots of pictures and adding this card to my electronics arsenal means i can snap longer before downloading onto my digital wallet storage device
shooting pics is less trouble with this card when compared to ones since this card doesn not so quickly
and storing files ( images , audio , documents , etc
) for my handheld computer is easier and more fun , too
and this card is not slower than others i have
my devices seem to read/write to this card at the same speed as my other cf cards .
i have used this card for months , and have yet to be disappointed
it works well in both my kodak and nikon digital cameras
i have never felt that it was too slow or unreliable
i'd buy again .
i purchased this compactflash card to use with my nikon coolpix 995
i have used it extensively and i cannot detect a difference in performance with a compactflash card for which i spent nearly twice as much
it works great and it is cheap
what is not to love about it ?
i use this card on my canon powershot s300 digital camera and it works flawlessly
the price is right also !
i searched a really long time for a good solution for my canon powershot g1
it takes microdrive , but when i asked around , i heard that they had some reliability problems
so i went with the largest memory i could buy
the camera itself came with 16mb , and i have another 48mb in cards from a previous digital - so altogether i can take over a thousand pictures at very high resolution
now i need a digital wallet for those long trips without a laptop - perfect combo .
the viking 128mb is cheap and works like it should -- i have had no problems at all
i can take up to <NUM> pictures on one card with my nikon coolpix <NUM> but usually use higher resolution and get <NUM> pictures
i have two cards and they last for even long vacations ( plus , you can use the national geographic approach when using this card -- take <NUM> pictures to get <NUM> good ones ! )
also , the rebate ( when it was offered ) worked just fine for me .
if you can get only one for your digital camera , let it be this one
i took my kodak digital camera decked out with this 128mb compactflash card on a road trip
i used the &quot ; middle&quot ; quality setting for the pictures , and managed to take over <NUM> photos ( the equivalent of rolls of film ) , filling not anywhere close to half the card ( at that setting , the card will store over <NUM> photos ) ! i am not a digital photography technoid by any stretch of the imagination -- i just like capturing memories of the places i go and the things i see
having the extra memory afforded by this little card meant that i could relax and not worry about running out of space for all my photos
transferring the photos to my laptop was a piece of cake , and took very little time -- partially a function of the card
i highly recommend this as the *first* accessory/upgrade you purchase for your camera !
nothing else is important !
this is a great card
i bought this with my s200 elph because i knew the included 8meg card wouldn not be large enough
it is transfer speed does talk a second or two , but its not long enough to make me irratated
also , the two sides of the card are very different , so i can tell which side goes up
the card also looks very cool , very shiny
before you buy this one , however , make sure that its the kind of card your camera/mp3 player/etc
takes , so you don not end up like the reviewer who said your mp3 player would need to be the size of a boombox to use this card
another plus is that this is the cheapest 128meg card i have seen on amazon
for a great value for a 128meg card , definately buy this one .
i got this cf card for my nikon coolpix <NUM> and it works flawlessly
it is really good to have a card that can store hundreds of digital shots
no technical problems
no compliance issues
great price
viking cf cards always live up to their expectations
overall , i am very satisfied with this product .
easily installed in my pda , this little chip lets me store hours' worth of mp3s for portable listening
i can also use it in my digicam to store hundreds of photos at a time
voila ! no more lugging a pc or pda every time i plan to take pictures .
plenty of space and never had any problems .
if you have had a <NUM> or above camera for more than a few days then you have realized that an <NUM> or <NUM> mb memory card is not going to cut it
in my opinion , you really have two good alternatives
( 1 ) a good capacity compactflash memory card like this viking card , or ( 2 ) one of the microdrives
this <NUM> mb viking memory card is a good value on a cost per megabyte basis ( i have not seen a better compactflash value anywhere ) , and it offers more peace of mind since it has no moving parts
however , the microdrive does cost less per megabyte ( in fact , for the same cost you will get <NUM> mb of storage vs
<NUM> mb with the viking ) , although you will have a miniature hard drive to worry about in terms of potential lost photos
i have got both , but i will only use the microdrive on long trips where i know i will need the storage space
and then i amn exceptionally careful with it
most people will be happier going the compactflash route , in which case this viking card is the best value and very reliable
i am very pleased with it
go ahead , it is pretty much an essential accessory .
you can not ask for anything more than it remain completely reliable and uneventful .
i recently purchased a hewlett packard digital camera that came with a <NUM> mb flash card
the vikings <NUM> mb flashcard is great
at xmas i took <NUM> pictures and still had <NUM> pictures available to take on the card
i recommend this card to anyone who , like myself loves to take pictures .
i really couldn not have asked for more or better performance , and this seems to be the best price/meg for most flash memory products .
i have a <NUM> megapixel canon elph and own two other cf cards , ( sandisk 64mb and fuji64mb ) reason i got another cf card was the price as of feb 2003 , was the lowest i have seen ever , and i did abit more research than before
check dpreview
com they have a section of cf card ratings and this particular card did very good , as far as speed and reliability
i did my own amateur testing and noticed "slight" differences , the viking and sandisk cards were abit faster in taking multiple shots
( but this is a matter of miliseconds ) reliability , i have had the two other cards for about <NUM> months and have not had a problem with data loss of any kind
on my <NUM> megapixel camera , the viking 128mb cf card shot about images "high quality" ( depending on image size , each image can be a different file size , depending on the information each one requires ) so , i would just stick with a big name like viking or sandisk and you really cant go wrong .
i am using this card in my canon s330 digital camera
gives me <NUM> photos on average quality , and <NUM> photos in highest quality
can not complain ! it is writes and reads plenty fast and i have had no problems with it whatsoever ! highly recommended !
i bought this cfc for my pda and now i have the posibility to carry as much documents , music , photographs , etc as i want .
i use compactflash for some of my digital cameras , and i have become a fan of the viking brand
however , i still buy by the calculation
currently , this number should always be less than 1
it is curious that the prices on these cards may fluctuate by as much as <PERCENT> in one day ! i suggest you find the card you want and track it a while .
i still can not believe a 128mb cf card cost me only
this is a very high quality product looks and performance wise not to mention the ease of usage
if you have a zip drive , this product acts just like a zip drive
man , this baby rocks with my canon a20 digicam .
i bought this product for the elph s300 and could not be happier
the card works seemlesly and stores about <NUM> pictures at maximum 2
1 megapixel resolution
the cost can not be beat ,
a nice addition if you have a laptop is a pcmcia viking adapter which allows you to plug the compact flash card directly into the computer and use it as a drive
this setup is much faster than any usb download or compactflash card reader and is ideal for digital images .
i have had no problem with this card
i would recommend it for someone who needs a little exta space
i keep it plugged in just to provide that extra bit of space and temporary back up .
this little card has been wonderful ! it works with my san disk imagemate reader and i have been enjoying trouble free service since purchase !
bottom line : this is a great card ( even with the aforementioned ' ) and a great deal
using it with my camera right now and simply couldn not imagine not having it
hundreds of pictures at a reasonable price ( that keeps dropping ) -- what else is there ? buy it now !
i just recently purchased a canon digital camera and i bought this at the same time
i can take so many pictures with my new camera ! if i would not have purchased this , i would have been disappointed with the fact that i can only take <NUM> pictures with my <NUM> mb card
with this card on the best resolution , i can take <NUM> pictures ! you definitely need something like this if you really want to take advantage of your digital camera .
viking may not have the greatest reputation in the world when it comes to their memory , but i have personally never come upon anything of theirs that left me feeling unsatisfied
this 128mb card is a great value for the money ( especially with the rebates )
transfer times are what you'd expect , there is nothing that makes this stand out of the crowd other than the price
but just make sure you are aware of the space capacity you will really be needing - it just isn not roomy enough to keep up with any cameras over 4mp
however , it is a solid and dependable backup that i always have with me whenever i am out shooting with my 5mp camera .
- i use it with &gt ; <NUM> mp canon s30 and it gives me <NUM> pictures
- it works reliably and i have not seen any issues with both my cards
- with the <NUM> mb card i know i will run out of battery before i fill the cf card
so , i see the <NUM> mb as the optimum card size .
what can be said about a memory card
it works very well , this is my third , the oldest one is almost <NUM> years and working with no problems
an added bonus is it comes in a little plactic box which makes it safer for storage in the camera bag
the rabate makes it very inexpensive too ! i also have the viking card reader for a laptop , was only $9 and makes transfering pictures to computer no effort at all !
i bought this one in <NUM> ( 7 years ago )
i still use it every week , and it works just like it did on day 1 .
great bargain ! easy to use and install
no problems
great product ! my jornada thanked me !
i was really happy with the viking cf cards till i got a lexar
it is noticabilly faster
with the cannon that matters cause the shutter is already kinda slow
i recomend you check out the lexar .
the compact flash cards are great and have a lifetime warranty on them
they are very tiny and slip in to your digital camera and pdas
this latest one with <NUM> mega bytes is awesome and it works great with the hewlett packard c315 camera
it stores over a <NUM> high quality images from your camera
however i believe that a lot of olympus digital camera is dont use the compact flash cards but instead use the smart media card which is slightly bigger than the compact flash card
so make sure this card is for the right device
this card fits inside the digital printers that print photographs
great card , good speed , i'd recommend it to anyone
and hey good price on it too !
i bought this card for my digital camera and i have had it for a while now
i have not had any problems with it , it was fairly cheap , and the speed seems to be fine
i reccomend it for anything except recording full 640x480 video at <NUM> fps , because since this isn not a high speed card , when i tried to record at that quality and resolution , i only got about <NUM> or <NUM> seconds of movie recording time before the card got too slow
other than that , i like this card and reccomend it
works well with my nikon
sandisk readers also are useful if you transfer or back up data
so small i always have it with me .
don not understand the problems that other folks had
it is just memory and you should find out whether it is go/ right away
in this case , it is no fuss for my olympus d460 ; it did not require formatting
buy it you just cannot beat the price of $32 and no shipping from amazon
com ( for 32mb postage stamp size memory ! i wanted to cry when thinking about the $500 that i paid for my first <NUM> mb external hard drive for my mac ! ) .
what is there to say ? great card for increasing your storage capacity
no problems whatsoever
the only question is , as cheap as these cards are getting , why not go ahead and spring for the <NUM> or <NUM> card ?
i have been buying viking in both smartmedia and compactflash itinerations for the last <NUM> years
i have never had a problem and i find they are priced more competitively than the other leading brand
however , i always buy by the calculation , and currently this number should always be less than 1
also , if you are looking to save $ , shop the same card for a week or two and you might see some serious price fluctuations .
i have ordered three of these things
they work great
never had any problems
they come with a nice plastic case that is perfect for storing the cards in my camera bag
update : i think i own about six of these by now ( 12/2003 )
still , no problems .
i own the ricoh rdc5000 digital camera , and i have been using an eight megabyte card
i was constantly having to download after only nine pictures at the higher resolutions
the <NUM> megabyte card quadruples my output with a minimum cost
i have just ordered another one so that i will have plenty of memory for my vacation .
i don not know what the fuss is about with buying only svhs tape for your svhs video recorder or adat machine
this tape performs better than most svhs tape and it is only vhs rating
but you don not have to modify this tdk tape case at all , none , no modification at all to play it in any svhs machines or adat machine
it will work just like svhs tape
i do not know what people are talking about drilling a hole in the case do not do it ! it is non sense , i tested this tape and it records perfectly in svhs mode in any svhs machine and any adat period
in fact all super high grade vhs tape will play and record just fine in any svhs machine , so you can also use other super high grade vhs tapes from other good brands as well
first thing i noticed is this tdk tape is the finest smoothest highest quality highest density magnetic particle tape you can buy for your vhs machine , adat , or any svhs machine
and it will not clog up your heads unlike cheap vhs tape or cheap svhs tape like quantegy
stay away from quantegy svhs or vhs tape , this tape will clog your rotary heads and you will have drop outs in your adat and svhs machine , definately not for masters ! like i said this tape is better quality than most super high grade svhs tape on the market , so you can not go wrong with this vhs tape , so please go pick some up today , if you can before the complete supply runs out
i do not know if tdk still makes this tape anymore ? does anyone have that answer ?
this is a great tapes
i bought another package because of the quality .
nothing special here , but it appears that amazon doesn not sell vhs themselves
right price point .
tdk manufactures excellent , extra high grade six hour blank vhs tapes for all purpose general recording of media
as long as you have the right kind of equipment , these tapes record television programs off tv or they can be used to make copies of a protected vhs tape
these tapes have six hours worth of blank recording space ; and this is useful when recording television shows , for example
in addition , you can record onto these tapes using different speeds so that the tape records two hours worth recording time , four hours worth recording time and six hours worth of recording
( you use your vcr to set this
) the best image quality will be at two hours worth of recording time but many people say they are satisfied with the image they get using the six hour recording time speed
the extra high grade of this blank vcr tape ensures that you get longer life out of these blank tapes
moreover , if you record a special event on these for a permanent video recording the quality of the video on the tape will outshine the quality of the video on the regular version of this vcr tape
things should look "sharper" and be a little bit more in focus , too
overall , tdk makes a great choice when you want reliable , blank extra high grade vhs tapes to record television shows or anything else that you wish to record
i have used this brand and i cannot think of any major complaints
i highly recommend tdk extra high grade six hour vhs tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a vhs cassette tape .
the clarity is so clear
i thought there would be something wrong with the picture , but there was no vertical rolling , no color bleeding , and no dark spots
the colors were soooo vivid , i thought i was watching the actual show
of course in a recorder material , the picture quality was worse than that of seeing it right infront of you
there was only like a <PERCENT> quality degrading
you won not even recognize it
it is like hdtv .
i wanted to try these video tapes for a long time so finally i decided to spend all that money and ordered them and what do i get ?
tdk ultimate quality , light blue and green box with a yellow and orange color stipe across
wrong item ! amazon also sell those tapes for a lot less
when contacted the seller this is what they said
"hurricane sandy wipe us out , picking up the pieces somewhere else , can you hold your order"what do you say to that ? i told the seller ,
i feel very sorry and had no idea and to forget about the order !
since i never was able to try the highly rated video tapes , the ones they send me are just ok !
thank you d

these are great batteries for us , we use them in our canon sx <NUM> cameras ( 2 )
we are amazed at how many shots they give us , far more than any recharageable battery that we have used in our other canon cameras ( a3100 and sx40 ) .
the battery you need for all of your digital things
it is lighter than conventional batteries and last much longer as well .
i have a controller that requires this type of battery
i used the 4x batteries and they ran for <NUM> playing hours
i have <NUM> playing hours currently on these 9x batteries and they show no signs of slowing down !
these are great batteries
i had one set in nikon f4s and used them for many trips and it is still going and going f0r four years alrady
light weight ( 1/3 the weight and at least 5+ times the power than the alkaline batteries
best of the all , it will not dmage your camera while storing
a true &quot ; everyready&quot ; ! hightly recommended .
works well and has lasted over a year on an outdoor temperature transmitter
i read that lithium batteries keep their voltage better in cold temps than do alkaline batteries .
i was able to take <NUM> digital images ( both day and evening flash shots ) with my olympus over a course of a <NUM> day vacation to los angeles and san francisco
the olympus takes <NUM> aa batteries
i thought i would need a 2nd set of batteries but the first set lasted the whole trip
great for vacations when you don not want to lug around a charger and a spare set of batteries , however if you take a lot of pictures with your digital camera , it might be wise to invest in two sets of rechargable nimh batteries and a portable charger .
this is the battery to buy for use in those applications where you want to &<HASHTAG> ; set it and forget it
&<HASHTAG> ; or where you don not want to be having to change batteries at inopportune moments ( like a digital camera )
my particular use is for a indoor/outdoor digital thermometer
the outdoor sending unit is subjected to heat extremes and need to function even in subzero temps
these batteries will last several years there with no problem
easily woth the extra money .
i primarily use these batteries in mynikon speedlight flash
i started using them about a year ago after much frustration with the lifespan of normal alkaline batteries
i am not a professional photographer but it is a pretty serious hobby ( addiction my wife would say ) of mine , and nothing drives me more crazy than my equipment becoming the limiting factor of what i want to do creatively
replacing batteries in the flash on what seems like a weekly basis is annoying--running out of juice in my camera flash at the wrong moment is much worse and can even be devastating depending on the context
thankfully these excellent lithium batteries from energizer are truly superior in performance over either normal alkaline or rechargeable batteries
i get shots out of a set of these , which makes them economical compared with the seemingly less expensive alternatives
it is possible to find these batteries in larger packs at big box stores , but they are actually the same price per battery overall
i prefer them shipped free to my door , even if they were slightly more expensive
however , it is worth noting that buying <NUM> of them is cheaper than just two : energizer ultimate lithium aa battery <NUM> pack
if you need more than two , i'd highly recommend getting a 4 , or even <NUM> pack to save some coin
these are great batteries for virtually any photography application weather in a digital or in a flash unit like the
as other reviewers have mentioned , they are not superior when used in low drain applications like a computer mouse
stick with normal alkaline or nimh batteries for those uses .
they don not last half as long for me as they are advertised which is all i can say
i have used them in digital cameras and dslr camera equipment .
bought these for their long life
i use them in my thermostat and co2 detector
if there is a better battery out there , i'd like to see it
to me , these are the best .
very happy with this order and the way packed and arrived ontime , used them in holiday wreath
they were good because lasted whole holiday season running nightly
will do business with them again in heart beat
i love the garmin emap
it does everything i ever wanted in a gps
you can even get software downloads from garmin is web site
there are many accessories available , and you will probably want them all ! the complete outfit is kind of pricey
if you want to upload maps you will need a separate data card , you cannot load maps into the stock unit
also , it eats a ton of batteries !
i use my emap for topographical maps
with the <NUM> meg of ram , i am able to download the areas covering the appalachian trail from west virginia to the southern end in virgnia
that takes about <NUM> meg--plenty of room for other regions as well
because gps signals are so weak , the antenna needs to be exposed to the sky to keep a good signal
the flat back of the emap makes a strip of velcro easy to apply to allow mounting of the unit on the shoulder strap of a backpack
the features aren not as numerous as the garmin iii+ , but it covers all the basics and provides a large , crisp screen
i haven not tried the dash mount for my truck , but it looks like it would do well in that environment as well .
i bought one of these a year ago and it worked really well for the first few months but more recently i have noticed that it has gotten more and more difficult to get reception even in completely open areas outside
i suspect that something has happened to the internal antenna - i have to admit that i am not that easy with electronic devices and probably have abused it while traveling more than i should have but the same , cell phones have held up better .
late this summer , i was driving a rented minivan from mendocino , ca , south to the bay area
it is about <NUM> miles
i was with three other adults and three children
instead of taking the recommended rt <NUM> southeast to rt <NUM> and south to the bay area , we decided to take a "shorter" route , due east on lake road to rt <NUM> to rt 101 , then south
well , the road we chose went through deep redwood forests
more often then not , we could not see the sky
there were times when the road was no longer paved , at times rutted
it was so narrow that for most of the way it would have been impossible for two vehicles to pass ( fortunately , no vehicles came our way )
the road often snaked around tree trunks as large as <NUM> feet in diameter
this road was on both our aaa map and gps ( i had preloaded the corresponding map onto my 64mb data card from the metroguide cd )
the going was very slow , and our "shorter" route soon became the "longer" route
we were too far along to turn around
my wife , seated in the back held the portable phone ready to call for assistance
i asked all to wait , to put her trust in the gps
after another half hour , we came to a junction--all narrow and
one of the roads was not on the aaa map
intuitively , it looked like the least likely road
but the gps indicated this road would take us to the rt 20
we took it , and before you knew it , arrived at the conventional rt 20
the gps saved the day
one of the greatest attributes of a gps is that it allows you to explore , to go where you normally would not , and discover new vistas
obviously , my emap proved that
besides this general function , there are several specific features i like about the emap
these include its portability and its ergonomic design
the emap has a relatively large display ( which can be backlit ) and it is light , just over <NUM> oz
when walking with this unit in a town or on a trail , i appreciate being able to hold and control the unit with one hand while always having the display in view
this is a result of the control buttons being below the screen
the emap is compatible with garmin is downloadable mapsource cds
these include u
roads and recreation , worldmap , u
topo , and metroguide u
with the mapguide u
cd , the emap can look up addresses and telephone numbers for nearby services and points of interest
i like being able find a particular restaurant or street address by entering it under the find feature , then tracking it
an arrow will point in the right direction and distance will be displayed
there are many available accessories , several which i recommend
i needed a larger data card
the unit comes with an 8mb card which will give you one region
this is okay if you will be using it in a limited radius
if you go elsewhere , you will need to load new data using a serial cable ( another accessory )
it is time consuming , which may suggest your getting another accessory , the garmin is usb data programmer
i have a 64mb card which captures from massachusetts to maryland ( 8 regions )
using the serial cable took over two hours to load the data
using the programmer took about four minutes
i definitely recommend this unit
its portability , versatility , its adjustable detail , and its accuracy give you the confidence to venture places without getting lost
one suggestion though--don not give up the paper map
use it to provide the fuller perspective a portable gps lacks .
an executive plaything that can not do what a buyer wouldexpect
s mapsouce products are oudated , inaccurate , andoverpriced
the etrex
does all that this unit can do and it ishalf the price
remenber keep it simple stupid .
i bought my specifically for use in the car and i have been very happy with its performance
i purchased the dashboard mount and the 12volt cord to go with the
the base map includes almost all of the major and roads in my area so i have not yet upgraded to the metro cd
the base map has suited my purposes well
i especially like the is ability to give directional driving information to specific map points ( can be waypoints or points entered on the base map )
the gives vehicle speed in mph , a trip odometer , and will give you information based on speed and distance
all very fun to use on trips
also has exit info ( food , fuel , lodging ) but i have not yet used that much
the can be a bit tedious -- entering waypoint info and place names can be difficult using the small paddle switch
warmup takes a few minutes cold but reacquiring your location is very quick
i have had no trouble maintaining satellite reception with the unit on the dashboard of my two cars .
i have recently moved to the states , hence i used to get lost all the time , and it was a hassle for me to find my way back
this prompted me to invest some money into a gps system
frankly the sole reason i chose this piece was the relative low price , however , i now think it was money well invested
there are however some cons to the gadget which one should keep in mind
first of all if you are driving alone then its kind of hard to keep an eye on the thing and drive as well
also you should have a memory cartridge and the mapsource cd rom for fuller and detailed view of the area , the base map is not as good as it becomes once the map is downloaded off the cd rom ( which means more money gone into it )
most of its features are good , however , `goto` would mark a path which is a straight line and not always the best one
so overall i would say that its a good one , but beware of the additional investments .
this is a great gps , handy and rugged
the display is larger than its more expensive counterpart
to really make yourself a road warrior , you need to get the mapsource cd is and at least a <NUM> meg card
the whole state of michigan took lest than <NUM> meg , including the great lakes
also , get the combination cigarette lighter power adapter and data cable , [
] has it for a great price , amazon doesnt sell it
remember the cable has to say emap on the box , the other combo cable has a round end and is for the street pilot and other systems
a carrying case would be handy , but the cover of emap is pretty rugged , i have dropped it a lot and not a scratch on it
the backlight is a bit dim , but its usuable
beware of the mapsource cd is though , they are not the most accurate , and garmin only updates the map software interface , not the maps themselves ( as of this writing , 1/29/01 )
and of course , no refund of software
thanks alot garmin , get your act together
the mapsource cd is are pricey ( $99 for roads and recreation and $179 for metroguide which you can find stuff by address )
i also suggest getting the suction mount for your windshield ( thegpsstore
com , amazon doesnt carry it ) , it holds the emap in place and lets you swivel it around
the combo power/data cable is long enough to reach my windshield from the cigarette lighter port on my taurus
all around , its a great device for the road warrior and traveler , the waterways mapsource cd even shows shipwrecks so you can dive for sunken treasure ( the emap isnt water depth resistant , so leave it on the boat )
one caveat though , it doesnt work well indoors
its built in antenna isnt that powerfull if you are under more than a
luckly it has an external adapter port
hope this helps .
i am a private pilot and was looking for a gps with a map overlay to replace my old magellan 2000
love this little gps , true , unlike an 'aviation' gps , you have to enter all the coordinates , manually for local airports , but what the heck , doesn not take that long to enter the info from your airport facillities directory
i don not really use it as a secondary or primary means of navigation , but i like to have it aboard because it serves as a nice to confirm that my other means of navigation are on the mark
another cool thing that pilots will appreciate , is the ability to immediately know your groundspeed ( quickly accounting for headwind and tailwind components ) which you would normally need to tediously calculate times between waypoints on your e6b
it even gives you a running update on when you will reach your waypoints/destination
love a handheld gps when a tower ( at an airport that i am not familiar with ) asks me to report at <NUM> or <NUM> miles/whatever because i can give them a report call at exactly ( or nearly so ) the distance that they specify , rather than 'eyeball' the distance and give an approximate guess ( important when there is no dme at/near the airport )
best part , is that it has most of the essential functions a private pilot would like , without the high cost of some of those 'aviation' handhelds
what i would recommend is to also buy a remote antenna ( garmin part <HASHTAG> 27c ) it comes with <NUM> ft of cable and an antenna that mounts with a suction cup holder on any smooth surface
this is something that i am having to buy now
the gps works fine without it , it is just that having the antenna increases your placement options in your plane
good flights !
the primary use for my gps is city driving , and in la it is a huge help
to use this unit for city driving you must also purchase the metroguide usa cd is
these cd is can upload data to the emap
this data includes addresses , businesses , and surface streets
i also have the external antenna for my car , and i find this helps a lot when the unit is in the car
it should be noted that it can not actually plan a route for you , but you can use the map to determine your route
also , it tells you how far away from your destination you are , and aproximately how long it will take you to get there
i have set waypoints all over the city so that i can always find my way
i can also punch an address in and it will show me right where that point is
i never get lost anymore
many people also use this unit for hiking , or camping , and i have used it for this a couple times as well , and have found it very useful
i have also taked it in the airplane and it is a kick to see where you are , and how fast you are going
i have used a number of other units and find this one to be the most versatile , and great all around .
this is a nice unit , and it is interesting to read the glowing reviews of customers who have owned the garmin emap for two or three weeks
i have owned the unit for over a year
it works well in the us
it will not guide you street by street to a location , but it will guide you &quot ; as the crow flys
&quot ; you get a straight line between you and the destination
it works
it does not work well in europe
i purchased the uk and french cds
i installed them on the memory card and used them in england , wales , and all over france
the first problem is that the garmin emap just doesn not pick up or hold on to the gps satellites in europe very well
it may be that they are too far south or that the antenna is designed for use in us latitudes
i have no explanation but if you intend to use this in europe , look for another unit
the second problem is that even after loading the uk and french metroguides , when you press the find button you get a list of us cities
i disabled the us city maps and i still got the list of us cities
you cannot &quot ; find&quot ; and navigate to a foreign city
the only way to navigate is to know where the city is , then scroll to it on the tiny emap screen and click on it
if you don not know where the city or tiny welsh village is , then you are completely out of luck
very frustrating either way
again , if you are travelling out of the us you should steer clear of the emap
my other problem is with garmin is service
i could not get my emap to communicate with my laptop
it communicated with three different workstations , but not my dell laptop
garmin tech support insisted that there was obviously something wrong with my laptop
i even read them the error messages from the mapsource program , which cited program line numbers with errors in them
they insisted that the problem was my laptop , not their software
i own my own software company , so i know a software problem from a hardward problem
my modem and palmpilot work on the laptop but the garmin does not
garmin is support staff refused to help or even acknowledge that there was a problem
they refused to bring the problem up with a senior support person or a programmer
i got the same answer no matter how many times i called and no matter who i spoke with
a year went by and i got along by using a workstation
recently garmin made an update available for their mapsource program that fixed a communications bug with some laptops
i downloaded it and magically my laptop started communicating with the emap
if you never need customer support , and you won not travel out of the us , then the emap is a product you should seriously consider .
garmin has a winner here - good screen , easy to use , and the maps are first rate
battery life is pretty amazing , the time is less than a minute , and it tracks well even in cars and aircraft .
i wanted a gps primarily for driving and finding addresses
the garmin emap deluxe does exactly for that purpose , and does it extremely well ! first of all , if you want to find specific addresses , you need to get the metroguide cd and download detail map info into your gps
otherwise , all you get is major roadways and highways
you won not get lost , but if the house you are looking for is located on some local road , you won not find it
you need a data cartridge to hold the detail maps
the emap deluxe comes with an <NUM> mb cartridge
<NUM> mb is sufficient , although i think it should have come with <NUM> mb
you also need a pc interface cable , which also comes with emap deluxe
8 mb will hold detail maps for approximately a radius of miles
if you are driving across states , bring a laptop and the cd
the screen is sufficiently large so that you won not have to scroll painfully
the display is clear , and the backlighting is very nice in that you don not lose any contrast
you can look at the thing in pitch blackness and you will see the map extremely well
this gadget is extremely fun to watch , and very satisfying-- i
you won not be disappointed in terms of what it can do-- whether those functionalities are worth ( the price ) , that is a different question
if you drive a lot and get lost a lot , or if you wish you can find shortcuts if you are stuck in traffic , it is definitely worth it
also keep in mind that the metroguide cds cost ( extra ) .
i have used the emap on several driving trips along the east coast and found it easy to use and the base map fairly accurate
but , i purchased the roads &amp ; recreation and found that maps in the north carolina region are over <NUM> years old
i contacted garmin and they confirmed that no updates have been published and they have no policy regarding providing updates to the maps ! while i like the functionality of downloading more detailed maps into the gps , investing $100 in obsolete maps and a company who doesn not seem to view this as a problem bothers me .
i wrote a review on the emap a while back in april and am now reviewing from a perspective
the emap is still so much fun to use
i use it every time i go , cruising , bikeing , or hiking
i have not yet had one glitch in the unit and it still runs as good as day one ! it hasn not gone through much toruture because it has been mounted in my suv , but it has held up very nicely ! since my last review , garmin has updated the software on the emap which adds a sunrise/sunset/moonrise/moonset feature which is very nice ! it gives you an attractive little diagram of the earth and where the sun and moon are along with written info
i have used the emap to its capability and would still highly recommend this gps to anyone because it is very adaptable to any lifestyle
garmin even makes a handle bar mount for you to take it on your bike or atv
there are just endless possibilities with this little contraption
overall grade : very recommendable ! if you want the technical info , look at my april review .
i purchased a refurbished model of the garmin etrex handheld
i received it within the stated shipping period and in excellent condition
upon opening the package , i thought there may have been a mistake
the shipped unit looked brand new
no blemishes or scratches anywhere
works and tested flawlessly when tested next to my cuda 250
i purchased the handheld to be a backup for when i used a different kayak or travel to another island
it took a bit of fumbling around to figure out all of the nuances
although the manual was included
who reads the manual anyway ? : ) a recommended product if you want a backup or want an entry level handheld gps
no bells or whistles needed , unless you are into that sort of stuff .
got this gps in <NUM> as a fancy toy
reception can be irritating , but it seems to do better than most -- it is locked on <NUM> birds / <NUM> feet in my living room
battery life is great ( i used nimh rechargables ) , the screen is great , interface is intuitive , etc
i have decided to give one to my dad for his birthday
i definitely recommend the pc cable w/ 12v adapter ( part <HASHTAG>- ; amazon is recommendation ) , as there is a lot of free and mapping and waypoint management software ( topografix , for starters )
it holds <NUM> waypoints and ~ <NUM> trackpoints ( 10 tracks )
in <NUM> years of long ( ~ <NUM> mi ) rides , long car trips , etc i have not had a problem with the memory limits
the price is right , the unit works great , and it is plenty of gps for my knocking around
and , for the record , i can get readings in commercial aircraft -- just hold it up to the window and give it time to acquire .
i bought this unit for my atv quad honda rancher and this thing is the best
fits right on to the quad with a mounting unit i picked up at amazon
it is not like a tom tom or a magellen gps but it will leave you a trail back to where you started from very easy to operate and you can save your spots so you can go back again
also tells you the best hunting and fishing times from where you are and tells you when the sun will go down and rise so you know when to turn back before night falls
i bought it so i would not get lost and it has worked out perfect for me
also tells you alt
speed you are going at and much more
when you turn it on for the first time it takes a little bit to get the sattelights , but after that it turns on fast
takes batteries so if you go out take a extra set just in case it dies
it remembers where you are
over all this unit is cost effective and if you get lost you will be happy to have this great unit to get you back
you do not want to land up somewhere for days with no food and cold temps
i am not a survival kind of guy so this is a must to have for me
i hope this reveiw was helpful .
the only complaint i have is that it goes through batteries fairly quickly
i find that batteries will last about <NUM> hours which is not good if i take a <NUM> hour trip
yes , i know i can bring more batteries
: )
- find this the best easiestbest priced gps out there
about idiot proof
we have hunters that get lost goin to the truck for beer
not any more .
i have had this one for ages , and it is still working like a champ
guided me around the great lakes and the gulf of mexico , and into and back from a lot of hiking in the woods
waterproof and bulletproof .
this little gadget introduced me to the world of gps , and i have been hooked ever since
this unit is very dependable and good for collecting data and building waypoints
a good solid product .
for my first gps i selected the garmin etrex
easy to use to mark waypoints and find them later
have not had to use it in the dark yet
setting up routes is nice just to know the distance between two points
i recommend this to anyone who needs something lightweight and simple .
i am still quite new to the magical world of gps
i should add that i have used the little garmin , but don not own one
this , i hope , cools a bit the potential excesses of owners' reviews
i will divide my remarks into two groups : i ) general considerations about &quot ; value&quot ; gps ; ii ) opinions about the performance of this product
about i ) i'd say that this is a good product to start with
it has no map download ability
yet , i used to locate points in a city i don not know well , to find your car in a praking lot , and to find my way back after a long drive
i can not really say how useful such device is for hicking or sailing , although i believe it could be a great help
having a map of your city/area is much more useful of course , but portability and cost suffer
finally , this is a great device , and a very enjoyable toy ( many functionalities like speed etc
are not that important , still they add to the fun )
about this specific system , the jury is still out
the case is very resistant and handy , but the ergonomics is less than excellent
we are all used to front buttons for portable appliances , like in cells phones and palm pilots , and garmin is seem awkwardly placed and just don not feel right
the screen is ok , but i have seen brighter screens
another drawback of the system is the limited battery lifespan
<NUM> hours is really too short
before i buy my gps , i will try the magellan 310 , which unfortunately is not offered by amazon ( yet ! )
i not similarly priced , slightly bigger , with larger buttons and longer battery lifespan
i would appreciate if some reader could send me their experiences
yet , all in all , this is really a great toy , useful to commuters and hickers alike , and still quite affordable
as a gift , i'd recommend it without hesitation
but if you are a conscientios consumer , i'd suggest that you explore all your your options .
i bought this unit to take with me deer hunting
it did not track the satellites initially so i returned it
i had the same difficulty with the second unit
the seller couldn not explain why both malfunctioned so i just got my money back
my advice is to take <NUM> aa batteries with you , open the package , install them and test the unit before you leave the parking lot
i guess there are no satellites over gray , georgia .
this is my first gps unit and i bought it for the price and the reviews
it really is a great buy
does what it is suppose to do
i am a novice hiker
i use this so at the very least if i get lost i will be able to find myself back to my car ! great buy for the price
just don not forget to mark key waypoints so you could trackback .
i purchased a yellow garmin etrex gps about a year ago
my main reason for buying it was because i learned about the sport called 'geocaching' , and , knowing little about these devices at that point , i purchased one on the advice of a couple of friends
i used it heavily for for about <NUM> months before coming to some conclusions about this device is capabilities
i will first list the yellow etrex is good points : - it is cheap-- one of the cheapest gps receivers you can find
- it is easy to find-- you can buy one at target , or at most any sporting goods store
- it is durable
you can drop it several times or dunk it in water , and it will still work ( dry it out first before you attempt to use it again )
- it has an interface to hook up to your computer to download new firmware and to download geocaching waypoints , if you have the need for this
- it is easy to use and very intuitive for first timers
now , its drawbacks
realize that i am rating this device from the viewpoint of a geocacher , and we are probably the most demanding users of gps receivers out there : - it is not an accurate device if you are attempting to get a definitive lock on a waypoint within 50' of your goal
once in the general search area , the signal will likely bounce around and give you wildly varying readings
for example , if you have entered a waypoint and get within 50' of your search area , expect to find readings bouncing around from feet with each step you take
i used this unit in varying terrain , under varying tree/bush cover , under varying weather/cloud conditions , and in varying temperatures , with the same results
i was able to obtain two other samples of this receiver , and those tests came up with the same results , so i surmise that my etrex wasn not just an errant sample of these receivers
upgrading the receivers' firmware did nothing to help the accuracy
granted , my experiences with this receiver probably won not matter that much to most of those who will purchase this unit for tasks such as finding your way around while camping , hunting and hiking
for those uses , this unit will work just fine
however , if you are a geocacher and want a gps unit that will pinpoint your goal effectively , without bouncing your readings from ft
as soon as you walk two steps any direction , you will want a gps unit that has waas capabilities ( wide area augmentation system )
i now have a gps receiver that has waas , and it provides a much more stable lock when in the area of my intended goal
in short , i found this unit to be frustrating to use for geocaching
there are other gps units that will provide more stable than the garmin etrex for close to the same price .
i really have no major complaints about my garmin etrex ( lovingly called "the yellow etrex" )
the interface is simple , and the unit is small and light
some may wish they had gone a step up to a model with the for easier interface navigation
i was one such person , and i have to admit that the thumb stick is much easier to use than the up/down buttons that you are limited to with the yellow etrex
buyer beware when it comes to used yellow etrex models
many versions of it were sold that were not waas enabled
you can ask a seller if the system menu has an option to disable/enable waas
if not , you are looking at a slightly less accurate model ( but if the price is right for you , it shouldn not matter too much ) .
mainly interested in snowmobiling and in lebanon , i would have given the etrex a five stars rating ( which it deserves ) but it has two weak points that prevented me with doing so
first it has no software and no cable shipped with it
for the 12v cigarette lighter cable , the data cable and the software cd you will have to spare at least and addtitional usd <NUM> to get the most out of the etrex
one of the strongest points are the features you get for a relatively low price , the great yellow shape ( no messy antenna ) and the autonomy on two alcaline batteries
overall , the etrex is an impressive product
my next step is the garmin summit
and this goes to people from garmin &quot ; you have got yourself some additional brand loyalty&quot ; .
i bought this unit not knowing what to expect
well it has exceded my expectations in every respect
first of all the one i just received has a newer software revision
it has waas and is software revision 3
10 which has a new screen which my friends with revision 2
* doesn not have
i looked on there website and they don not offer this revision for download so it must be something that just brand new usits offer
well anyways
i use this with a program called expertgps which overlays my tracked trails on an aerial photomap from satellites
so cool
i can see excatly where i rode
mine worked flawlessly in the woods
now it is winter here and there are no leaves on the trees but i think it will work just as good in the summer
i got the bike mount and mounted the unit to my yamaha kodiaks handle bars
workes great
battery seems to last a very long time for me
i have used it a few days hours at a time and there still going
i am one very satisfied customer
oh you need to get the serial cable to hook this to a computer to view your trails and edit your waypoints and many other cool stuff .
although it took a while for me to get the device to pick up the satellites , once i did it was all it promises to be
this one is great because it fits in your pocket
i have wanted to get a gps for a long time now and recently received this one as gift
i have used it for about two weeks and am very impressed
it is very small and light and easily fits in a pocket
i bought the bike mount accessory and have mounted this on my bike
it is small enough that it doesn not add a lot of weight or get in the way
although it lacks mapping capabilities and some more advance features , it does everything that you really need a gps to do
i live in the desert so i have not been able to test this under tree cover but - surprisingly -- it works great sitting on the passenger seat of my truck
other units i have seen wouldn not function inside of a vehicle without an external antenna
it seems to be very accurate and i have been able to get a reported accuracy of <NUM> feet
i was amazed at how accurately it was able to record my speed and distance traveled
the manual could be written more clearly but the unit is very intuitive
i have never used a gps before but was quickly able to figure out how to use all of the features
the buttons placemat was supposed to be designed for one hand operation
however , because the unit is so small , and i have large hands , it was a little awkward for me
i ended up using two hands to work the unit
the display is readable in bright sunlight and the backlight feature makes it possible to use the unit in dimly lit situations
i do have a gripe about battery life
it is supposed to run for <NUM> hours in &quot ; battery save mode
&quot ; in regular mode , i went though my first set of batteries after about hours of use
if you are taking this into the field - bring lots of spare batteries .
great gps for the price
went mountain biking and hiking and it worked great ! the manual was rather complicated , and don not buy the instructional video , it is worthless .
i bought this device for my brother who likes to hike and fish
given the reasonable price i thought it would be a nice introductory gps device
if your needs are simple and you don not need map functions , this would be a good choice as a starter unit until you decide if you want to invest in a more gps unit
this unit works as they say
i only need it for location coordinates and it works great
i tried setting markers and waypoints to find my way back to a starting point , but the unit seemed to want me to return in a straighter line vs the one i walked
many other features i have yet to use and may not need as i only need a location point
for the money , i got what i paid for .
i bought this , used it a coupla years , then gave it to my niece and bought myself a lowrance igo
used it a coupla years , then it died on a geocaching trip
although the lowrance cost less and had more features , i went right down to wally world and bought another etrex -- this time the h model with more sensitivity
for one thing , i needed it now
but besides that , the lowrance was just too irritating to use while the etrex is a pleasure
that said , the problem with the base model etrex is that it requires a special adapter ( $$$ ) to connect it into your computer to download waypoints , and it will only hold waypoint names of six characters
the adapter costs so much that it is cheaper to buy the next model up , which has a usb connector and plugs right in
the only reason i didn not was that i already had the adapter .
this doesn not have many bells and whistles
but if you can get a lattitude and longitude for what you want to find , it will take you to within 50' or so of it
if you want to know where you were ( within about 50' ) , it will do the trick
i am a land surveyor , and have used this in the woods a lot to get in the neighborhood of something i am looking for
tough , simple receiver .
i have been thinking about a gps for kayaking for at least two years , but none of the units on the market met my requirements for ruggedness , water resistence , utility and low cost- until the etrex
this is a *superb* little box
it is not only rugged and waterproof , it is very well enginnered and very handy
it provides all the necessary information needed for navigation- location , speed ( real and average ) , distance traveled , direction , bearing to a waypoint , and so forth
you can store mutilple routes , too
until garmin comes out with a similarly sized package that does detailed mapping this will be my main navigating tool on land and water
i have been using it for kayaking and bicycling for a few hundred miles now and i have no complaints- well , i suppose it would be nice if it floated , too , but barring that i just keep its lanyard attached to my kayak when i go out paddling
overall , a superb value for bikers , hikers and small boaters .
i own one of these , and i was really looking forward to it as an upgrade of my old gps38
what a big mistake ! [my background : i am a mountain climber , experienced land navigator , and use my gps all the time
my normal use for the gps is to confirm my location and figure out the bearings to other mountains so i can be sure which summit is which when viewing them from new locations
but i have actually used the gps for real navigation when caught out on a glacier in dense fog
]the problem isn not the unit itself , really
the antenna works fine and easily picks up a solid signal , even from inside my house ( top floor , not bottom floor )
but the operating system is terrible
the gps38 was much more usable
for example , this unit does not even feature a simple "you are here" page
you have to actually mark a waypoint and then get it to display the location of that waypoint
for only about $
more you can get the garmin etrex venture , which is much more useful
frankly , i can not wait to break my etrex so i can justify upgrading it
this is the bottom end of gps units , and it shows .
garmin designed this unit to be a rugged , low cost , small , easy to use gps , with good basic funtionality for casual users and beginners
and that is exactly what it is
it is water and vibration proof ( mine is mounted on the handlebar of my motorcycle ) and fairly simple to navigate through its menus
the display is readable and gives easy to use information , yet it easily fits in a pocket and the palm of the hand for one handed operation
this is not a &quot ; navigate the highway systems know where all the gas stations are&quot ; unit
it is a basic unit designed for backpackers , canoers , campers , snowshoers and skiers
you can mark waypoints and save tracks ( a record of your movements ) and backtrack over a track easily
any time it is on , it leaves a virtual &quot ; trail of breadcrumbs&quot ; that makes it easy to go back the way you have come
limitations ? remember , this is a basic , low cost unit
the main limitation is memory ( lack of )
a long trip ( e
a highway trip ) can easily consume all of the unit is memory , so that you run out of storage space for tracks
way points are limited to six character descriptors , and trying to come up with something that makes sense can be challenging
you cannot download or display maps with this unit
all that said , i have had mine for a couple of years , and find it very handy for traveling in unknown to me waterways and trails
i also used it on a recent long distance motorcycle tour and found the trip distance , altitude , average speed , and compass features super handy , and easy to scroll through with one hand
if you are like me and want a rugged , basic , accurate , easy to use gps unit that doesn not consume your entire bank account , then this is s great unit
it is also a great place to start with gpsing to see if you like it/need one/want/one , and will help you know what you want to see on the next gps that you buy
for the money , an unbeatable buy !
if you are looking for a basic gps this one is for you
i use it for hiking and fishing and love it
it tells you haw far you have travel and at what speed
it tracks your progress
it allows you to save up to <NUM> waypoints ! the only major disadvatage is not being able to download maps , but since most maping gps units cost over $250 , i will take it
i was also looking at the magellan 315
they are very simular but for my needs this one is perfect , less expensive and waterproof ! i highly recommend this unit .
i have not used a gps unit before , but purchaed this based on reviews
with nothing to compare it to , i can report the following : although the instructions are straight forward , i found that the buttons are not so easy to navigate
i make many mistakes in programing and have to start over
i also found the this is not very accurate
at <NUM> feet , the gps unit will show any direction
i have to get to within <NUM> feet of a way point to start getting any type of accuracy
if i did not know the direction of the way point at feet i literally have to walk in circles and watch the unit point me false directions
again at <NUM> feet it is accurate
i have used this in the up of michigan and it takes about <NUM> minutes to get the satellites up and running
also , if you want to save the information on your computer you will need to buy the cords , about $20
00 , once i purchased these i then found i would have to purchase the software , it was not free at garmin , so that would be another $20
i returned the cords and did not get the software
so if you want to save your information plan on spending another $40
for my first gps i think it is okay
i think if you are hiking , you would need to do a lot more research and probably spend more money to get something with greater accuracy .
i received mine yesterday
it works fine
for some reason it took serveral minutes to get a signal the first time though
*just a warning if you are an impulse buyer like me
*the amazon add has details on the product and it shows a color display
that is the etrex venture cx model
the one here is the basic
i was expecting color
my bad for buying so quickly without reading
also i expected a data cable
any other product on the planet comes with one if needed
i just bought the cable today
with shipping it was $45
i didn not expect this either
my bad
i am sure i will have fun with it .
who would put a hole ( presumably to equalize pressure ? ) in the back of a portable gps ? ipx7 no way
what did garmin expect would happen if a warm gps fell into cold water ? very first time it went 4&<HASHTAG> ; into water for no more than five seconds it sucked water in and never would turn on again
a simple internal bladder is all it would take
this thing is garbage if you need it any where near water .
i bought one of these units because of its waterproof rating
that is <NUM> minutes at 3
3 feet
forget that one
the battery compartment isn not rated for this
so it leaks big time
i called garmin about this and they said that nothing can be done
there is no fix
this was december 2000
since it eats batteries , i bought a radio shack digital camera battery kit
it has <NUM> batteries rated at 1500mah and a chargerfor $22
this unit worked very well
since the batteries compartment isn not waterproof the batteries got wet
i was in sea water and these batteries got ruined
if you plan on buying this gps and using it around water , i would be careful in not using expensive batteries in it
windsurfing , kayaking , canoeing , white water rafting and the rest , be careful
if you buy their super expensive cable , you can update your unit free from their web site
they do offer great upgrades for their products , free
i only give the unit <NUM> stars
i own three of their products and this is the worse one for not living up to what they say it will do
the best one out there for tuff service is the gps <NUM> version .
my etrek is primarily used as a navigational aid when i am bicycling the poorly signposted roads of northern ireland
the signposts are there , of course , hidden behind a corner as you pass them by , or as an indication to a town fifteen miles further on from the town you'd expect to be signposted in the first place
all this turns a long day in the saddle , into a very long day in the saddle
but with the etrek loaded with waypoints , i simply have to follow the guiding - go to - pointer , and save myself a lot of hassle
the etrek hasn not saved my life , as yet , but one is imagination can fill in the blanks
just remember to carry extra batteries and make sure that your mobile phone is charged : - )
this little gps is about as simple as it gets
i have had mine for about <NUM> days now and have found it to be very useful
keep in mind this is a 'basic' unit as it cannot have maps uploaded to it
however it does what it claims to with effeciency and accuracy
i was amazed that something this small could locate me in my car or while walking
i do lots of outdoor photography so this unit is perfect for marking spots that i want to come to again
i am already pretty good at navigating myself around most places ( one of those gifts god bestowed upon me ) so the etrex is simple design and use is perfect for me
if you are light hiker or are just getting into the world of owning a gps the etrex is perfect for you
if you desire an onscreen map then a higher end model will be more to your liking
my only fret with etrex is its inability to pan around your track that you create
you are only able to zoom in and out ! hopefully a future driver update will fix that
happy trails
this item really rocks ! its very small and portable but really packs a whallop ! i can set this to track my route , go on an adventure , get home and download the data into my computer , and then print out a topographic map showing my route and any points of interest i marked along the way
( the downloading and map capability are accesories not sold with the gps ) anybody can pick this up and learn it in no time
i use it both for business and pleasure and never lets me down
great toy !
i highly recommend not getting this unit
the garmin unit doesn not work well enough to do anything with
i am up high on a mountain with great sky coverage , lots of satellite lock in , awful inaccuracy
waste of money .
before you lose the patience to read through the rest of the stuff , i would strongly suggest that you get yourself a pc interface cable and download free gps software from [
] or pay for one at [
] ( with additional features ) with so many gps in the market , it is confusing which one to buy , unless you are clear about what your needs are
i jotted down a few points as to why would i really need a gps : ( 1 ) never to lose my bearings on hikes ( 2 ) keep track of where i went and share this data to others ( 3 ) keep track of altitude ( 4 ) get to know of sunset and sunrise times so that i known when to get back to camp and when to start the next day ( 5 ) speed at which i walk and estimate the amount of time i would take to reach my destinationetrex satisfies all of this
what is that i do not like about the etrex ( 1 ) altimeters are not accurate ( in any gps ) , so get a barometric altimeter in addition to a gps ( 2 ) something miserably wrong with sunset and sunrise timings
my gps shows sunrise time as 18 : 51 and sunset ast 06 : 30 ( ? ) and it is inaccurate even if you transpost it
etrex loses a * for this ( 3 ) useless in heavy tree cover ( in any gps ) ( 4 ) battery life could have been betterdespite all that , i am very happy with my etrex , it cost me exactly $100 , meets almost all the features that i am looking for
many of my friends ask me this question - are you sure that this gps works in india ? ofcourse , it does , it is a global positioning system ! i have used it in us , canada , singapore and korea and works everywhere , even in the forests in western ghats in india .
nothing bad to say about it since it works just as what it is suppose to .
i buy spindle after spindle after spindle of these , and they are great
i never burn coasters ( that is , end up with a cd that didnt burn correctly and cant be used for anything except my chai mug ) , and i never have trouble playing them elsewhere
every other brand i have ever tried has had at least one of those problems
memorex has always been .
for certain applications , 700mb is the only option
unfortunately these memorex is are really substandard and produce an enormous array of errors--even when burned at 2x
they might be acceptable if one is burning a disc of relatively small files of say 10mb or less
but for applications or copying , well
here is my short list of things i plan to do with my collection of <NUM> or so memorex duds : swanky drink coastersammunition for letterman to throw from buildingsdisposable frisbeestied to a to make a baby mobilethe possibilities are endless
if you want these to function in the manner for which you most likely purchased them however , pay the extra $ and get the memorex black .
these are full length ( 700 mb ) disks that are able to take advantage of today is faster cd burners ( my 24x yamaha burns a full one in &lt ; 3 mins ! )
the price per disk can not be bettered , and the quality of the first <NUM> i got was <PERCENT> perfection
sweet !
